Each pump decision was associated with earning one point but also increased the risk that a balloon would explode. If participants pumped a balloon too many times, the balloon would explode and participants would lose all the points they had earned for that balloon. However, if participants chose to cash out before the balloon exploded, the points they earned would be added to the running total of points, which was presented on the screen as a points meter. Participants were instructed that their goal was to earn as many points as possible during the task. Each event (e.g., larger balloon following a pump, new balloon following cashed or explosion outcomes) was separated with a random jitter (500-4000ms). Balloons exploded after 4 to 10 pumps, and the order of balloons was presented in a fixed order (after being pseudo-randomly ordered prior to data collection), although none of this information was made available to participants.

The intensity of the upcoming stimulus was indicated by the color of this arrow (red: painful vs. green: nonpainful). After a jittered blank screen (35001500ms), the electrical stimulus (500ms) was delivered during simultaneous presentation of another visual delivery stimulus (1000ms). The latter consisted of a picture of the confederates face, shown with either a painful or a neutral expression, or, in case of self-directed stimulation, scrambled versions of these pictures were shown to control for visual stimulation. Depending on the stimulus category, these pictures were accompanied by either a red (painful) or green (nonpainful) flash in the lower right corner of the picture. The delivery cue was followed by a fixation cross (50002500ms), and an optional rating (self-directed: one rating question; other-directed: two rating questions; 6000-ms answering time per each question).

Ratings were collected in about one third of the trials in a pseudorandomized fashion. Between trials, a fixation cross (2000ms) was presented.

In the second run (empathy for affective touch) a confederate acting as a second participant was supposedly undergoing affective touch, and participants were instructed to empathize with her feelings. In every single self-directed trial, visual presentation of an object was accompanied by simultaneous stroking of the left palm at 1Hz for 2s in proximal-to-distal direction with a material whose touch resembled the touch of the object depicted on the screen.
