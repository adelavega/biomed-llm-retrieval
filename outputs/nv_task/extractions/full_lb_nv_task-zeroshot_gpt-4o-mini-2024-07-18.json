During the scan session, participants were presented with a sequence of 24 balloons that they could pump up to earn points. Each pump decision was associated with earning one point but also increased the risk that a balloon would explode. If participants pumped a balloon too many times, the balloon would explode and participants would lose all the points they had earned for that balloon. However, if participants chose to cash out before the balloon exploded, the points they earned would be added to the running total of points, which was presented on the screen as a points meter. Participants were instructed that their goal was to earn as many points as possible during the task. Each event (e.g., larger balloon following a pump, new balloon following cashed or explosion outcomes) was separated with a random jitter (500-4000ms). Balloons exploded after 4 to 10 pumps, and the order of balloons was presented in a fixed order (after being pseudo-randomly ordered prior to data collection), although none of this information was made available to participants. The BART was self-paced and would not advance unless the participant made the choice to either pump or cash out. Participants were told that they could win a $10 gift card at the end of the neuroimaging session if they earned enough points during the task.

Trials were structured as follows: First, an arrow (2000ms) indicated the target (self vs. other) of the upcoming stimulus. The intensity of the upcoming stimulus was indicated by the color of this arrow (red: painful vs. green: nonpainful). After a jittered blank screen (3500-1500ms), the electrical stimulus (500ms) was delivered during simultaneous presentation of another visual delivery stimulus (1000ms). The latter consisted of a picture of the confederates face, shown with either a painful or a neutral expression, or, in case of self-directed stimulation, scrambled versions of these pictures were shown to control for visual stimulation. Depending on the stimulus category, these pictures were accompanied by either a red (painful) or green (nonpainful) flash in the lower right corner of the picture. The delivery cue was followed by a fixation cross (5000-2500ms), and an optional rating (self-directed: one rating question; other-directed: two rating questions; 6000-ms answering time per each question). After self-directed stimulation, participants rated their own pain (self-directed pain ratings), using the question 'How painful was this stimulus for you?' on a seven-point rating scale ranging from not at all to extremely painful. After other-directed stimulation, participants rated the other persons pain (other-directed pain ratings; 'How painful was this stimulus for the other person?' answered using the same seven-point rating scale as for the self-directed pain ratings), as well as their own unpleasantness during other-directed stimulation (unpleasantness ratings; 'How unpleasant did it feel when the other person was stimulated?'; seven-point scale, from not at all to extremely unpleasant). Ratings were collected in about one third of the trials in a pseudorandomized fashion. Between trials, a fixation cross (2000ms) was presented. In sum, 15 trials per condition (i.e., self-directed pain/no pain; other-directed pain/no pain) were presented. Participants were instructed to empathize with the other person.", "Following the empathy for pain paradigm, we applied a touch paradigm including 15 pleasant, 15 unpleasant and 15 neutral stimuli in pseudo-randomized order.

In the second run (empathy for affective touch) a confederate acting as a second participant was supposedly undergoing affective touch, and participants were instructed to empathize with her feelings. In every single self-directed trial, visual presentation of an object was accompanied by simultaneous stroking of the left palm at 1Hz for 2s in proximal-to-distal direction with a material whose touch resembled the touch of the object depicted on the screen.
