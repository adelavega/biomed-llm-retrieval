At the time of manuscript preparation, data collection included up to three time points (i.e., baseline and two annual follow-ups). In the interest of studying substance use risk and eventual initiation and escalation, initial enrollment for the NCANDA study targeted youth at risk for substance use based on measures of psychopathology and family history of substance use disorders (see 2.2 ) but with limited substance use. The study aimed to achieve a sample that consisted of approximately 50 % of participants at risk for substance use. Exclusion criteria included contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; e.g., non-removable metal implements), medical history that would compromise MRI (e.g., traumatic brain injury), and a current or persistent major psychiatric disorder that would interfere with testing (e.g., psychosis). The study protocol was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board. Informed consent and assent were obtained from adults and minors, respectively.

After they gave a written informed consent, 4 ml extra blood was obtained when they were undergoing blood sampling during the physical examination. They were told that DNA genotyping results would not be sent to them. Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood leukocytes using salting out method . 917 of the 1220 samples were genotyped for the APOE allele type using PCR-RFLP .
