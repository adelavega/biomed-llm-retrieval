# biomed-llm-retrieval

The goal of the project is to use LLMs to extract annotations from the abstract/texts of biomedical papers, with a focus on fMRI.

To start, we are going to use OpenAI's GPT using custom built prompt templates.

We will apply these models to predict human annotations from this project: https://litmining.github.io/labelbuddy-annotations/overview.html
