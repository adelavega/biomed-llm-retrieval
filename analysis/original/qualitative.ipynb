      "Thirty-four healthy, right-handed, heterosexual German subjects (age-range 23–45 years) participated in the study after giving their informed consent. The study was approved by the local Institutional Ethical Review Board and was performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. Men were examined once, women twice in pseudo-randomized order—once 1–3 days after onset of menses (early follicular phase) and once in the midluteal phase adjusted for cycle length (individual cycle length −7 days with a range of ±2 days). Only pre-menopausal women with stable cycle length were included and any form of hormonal treatment was excluded. The phase of the menstrual cycle was confirmed by sex steroid hormone analysis (for details see below). None of the subjects had a history of a serious medical disease, or any neurological or psychiatric illness. Twelve females and 12 males were included in the final analysis (for details see Table  ).   \n",

      "\n",
      "Reasons of exclusion were either technical or to achieve homogeneity of the hormonal status and cycle phase. A second fMRI scan could not be obtained for two women. In six female participants, the sex steroid hormone analysis revealed values not corresponding to the target phase of their menstrual cycle that was expected from their menstrual history (four anovulatory cycles, two cycles with high progesterone levels in the presumed early follicular phase). Two males were excluded because of unusually low or high testosterone levels. \n",
      "\n",
      "Intelligence was assessed using CFT 20 (Weiss  ) and MWT-B (Lehrl et al.  ), two German standard short measures for estimating intelligence quotients based on visuo-spatial and verbal material, respectively. There were no significant differences between men and women for age or intelligence measures (see Table  ). All participants had more than 12 years of education. Handedness was assessed by the Edinburgh handedness inventory (Oldfield  ). \n",

      "  \n",
      "Thirty-three individuals participated in the study: 15 participants with Autism Spectrum Disorder (12 males; 3 females) and 18 non-autistic control participants (13 males; 5 females). Groups were matched on age (ASD   M  : 38 years, SD: 13; control   M  : 32 years, SD: 8;   t  (31) = 1.6,   p   = .13), and IQ (ASD   M  : 119, SD: 14; control   M  : 119, SD: 11;   t  (31) = 0.1,   p   = .93). Full-scale IQ was measured using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale 3rd UK Edition ( ), apart from one control participant for whom IQ was estimated from the National Adult Reading Test (NART;  ). All participants in the ASD group had previously received a diagnosis from an independent clinician according to standard criteria. The Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G,  ), was used to characterise the participants’ level of current functioning. This measure was chosen because all participants were adults; it was therefore not always possible to interview parents or caregivers, as required by other measures such as the Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI;  ). On the ADOS-G, eight participants met criteria for autism, whilst six participants met criteria for autistic spectrum disorder. One participant was unwilling to complete the ADOS-G. All participants were right-handed, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and were naïve with respect to the purpose of the experiment. None had performed the present experimental tasks, or related tasks, previously. The experiment was performed with local ethical committee approval and in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before their inclusion in the study. \n",

The 18 remaining participants were right-handed, native speakers of British English (mean 26.7 years, median 22.5 years, range 18–60 years) without any history of neurological or psychiatric disease. The behavioural and neuroimaging data from the older participant (the one 60 year-old) did not differ qualitatively from the younger participants and therefore was included in all analyses. None had any form of oral or written language impairment or any previous experience with time-compressed speech. None of the participants reported any hearing difficulties, but were not audiometrically screened. In-scanner preliminary testing revealed that all participants could hear the stimuli clearly enough to perform the task (see  , below). All gave written informed consent and were paid for their participation. The study was approved by the NHS Berkshire Research Ethics Committee. \n",

      "Fifteen participants were phobic prone (PP) (6 females; mean age 39.2; standard deviation [SD] 7.4) and 15 were eating disorders prone (EDP) (5 females; mean age 34.4; standard deviation [SD] 8.65). The couples enrolled had been together in a committed relationship for the last three years and had been living together for at least one year. To assign the participants to a group, they were assessed with a semi-structured interview  –  and the Personality Meaning Questionnaire (PMQ)   one month before the scanning session. Concordance between the two investigators was 100%. As in our previous study  – , the semi-structured interview was administered independently by two trained investigators who were blind to each other's results. The aim of the semi-structured interview was to assess the key themes characterizing different affective-cognitive styles in the matter of emotional activation, duration and regulation. The semi-structured interview was divided into three consecutive steps. The subject was asked to give a detailed account of two meaningful emotional experiences involving anger and fear. After the account, the interviewer marked the characteristics of the appraisal, regulation and duration of the emotional experiences. If necessary, the interviewer asked for more details and then, the interviewer assessed the underlying predominant affective-cognitive style. The PP key themes detected were the tendency a) to focus on the visceral bodily states once the basic emotions have been triggered (automatic appraisal), b) to have the subjective perception of inability to modify these emotions after they have been triggered (duration), c) to have control over bodily-emotional condition aimed at limiting the emotional intensity; fear in these subjects lasts just as long as the perception of not being in control (regulation). Instead, EDP key themes detected were the tendency a) to focus on the outward referent recognized as the source of one's own emotional states (reflective appraisal), b) to have the subjective perception of capability to rapidly change these emotions by modifying the simultaneous focus on a different point of reference (duration), c) to adjust their personal stability to the perceived source of reference; being without a point of reference is perceived by these subjects as a feeling of emptiness (regulation). The PMQ questions on which PP subjects tend to score higher identify a score of need for emotional over-control in situations that may be felt as potentially dangerous (PP score)  . The questions on which EDP subjects score higher identify a score for need for consent and approval, sensitivity to judgment, and vulnerability to criticism (EDP score)  . \n",

      "We recruited healthy, young participants (872 females, 546 males, mean age = 22.39 y, SD = 3.27). Advertising was done mainly at the University of Basel and in local newspapers. The participants were free of any neurological or psychiatric illness, did not take any medication at the time of the experiment (except hormonal contraceptives), and were between ages 18 and 35 y. Physical and mental health was assessed based on standard questionnaires. The experiment was approved by the ethics committee of the Canton of Basel, Switzerland. All participants gave written informed consent before participating in the study. Prior to the analysis, the sample was divided into a discovery sample (  n   = 945, 2/3 of all participants) and a replication sample (  n   = 473, 1/3 of all participants) by randomly assigning participants to one of the samples. Randomization was performed using the Matlab function randperm. There were no significant differences between the discovery and replication samples in terms of age, sex, or emotional memory enhancement (  P   ≥ 0.33, 2-sided testing,   n   = 1,418). \n",

These sample sizes are proportionally in line with those reported by  .

This study was approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee of Xuanwu Hospital. The AD and MCI subjects were recruited from patients who had consulted the memory clinic at Xuanwu Hospital for memory complaints. The healthy elderly controls were recruited from the local community. \n",

The diagnosis of AD fulfilled the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition criteria for dementia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994), and the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria for possible or probable AD (McKhann et al., 1984). The subjects were assessed with the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score  , CDR of 1 and 2 was assigned to the AD category. \n",

      "Participants with MCI had memory impairment but did not meet the criteria for dementia. The criteria for identification and classification of subjects with MCI   was: a) impaired memory performance on a normalized objective verbal memory test; b) recent history of symptomatic worsening in memory; c) normal or near-normal performance on global cognitive tests (MMSE score>24), as well as on an activities of daily living scale; (d) global rating of 0.5 on the CDR Scale, with a score of at least 0.5 on the memory domain; e) absence of dementia. \n",
      "\n",
      "Healthy controls met the following criteria: a) no neurological or psychiatric disorders such as stroke, depression and epilepsy; b) no neurological deficiencies such as visual or hearing loss; c) no abnormal findings such as infarction or focal lesion in conventional brain MR imaging; d) no cognitive complaints; e) MMSE score of 28 or higher; f) CDR score of 0. \n",

      "Participants with contraindications for MRI such as pacemaker, cardiac defibrillator, implanted material with electric or magnetic system, vascular clips or mechanical heart valve, cochlear implant or claustrophobia were excluded.

There were no significant differences between groups in terms of intellectual ability, as measured by either education or the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (Wechsler,  ):   M  : YA = 16.85 vs. OA = 16.38 years;   M  : YA = 43.96/50 vs. OA = 39.75/50. \n",

      "We used high-resolution structural images for our analyses (MPRAGE; TR = 1,950 ms; TE = 2.26 ms; FA = 7°; 1-mm isotropic voxel; FOV = 256 mm) and five identical task runs of the dataset (142 volumes for each EPI; 41 interleaved 4-mm slices with no gap; TR = 2,000 ms; TE = 25 ms; FA = 90°; matrix size = 64 × 64; FOV = 256), in which participants were exposed to different levels of auditory and visual stimuli in terms of emotional arousal and saliency (Lee et al.,  ). The images were acquired on a Siemens 3T Magnetom Trio with a 32-channel matrix. Preprocessing was performed using the FMRIB software library (FSL ) including skull stripping and tissue mask segmentation (CSF/WM/GM) of structural images after bias-field correction; first three volumes cut, motion correction, smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of FWHM 6 mm slice-timing correction, grand-mean intensity normalization of the entire 4D data set, ICA denoising using ICA-AROMA , and 0.001–0.08 Hz linear-trends filtering and regressing out CSF/WM signal. To examine intrinsic functional connectivity unrelated to task-induced activity, all task-related activities were also regressed out (Fair et al.,  ; Elliott et al.,  ). For details of the task-activity related connectivity analysis and the task itself, please see the previous work (Lee et al.,  ). Finally, the preprocessed resting-state-like fMRI data were transformed to standard MNI 2-mm brain through the non-linear transformation matrix of structure-to-standard-brain using the Advanced Normalization Tool library (ANTs ). \n",

      "Through the preprocessing, we identified that one of the OA participant’s data was contaminated by severe motion across runs (mean framewise displacement, FD, and DVAR were 0.57 mm and 63.36, respectively). Because the severe motion can significantly reduce the estimation reliability of the functional connectivity (Power et al.,  ), we excluded this participant’s data from further analysis (final data   N   = 51; mean FD and DVAR were 0.054 mm and 12.45, respectively). \n",

      "Eighty adolescents aged from 12 to 20 years participated in the study. Exclusion criteria included age, the presence of any neurological problem or a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder according to DSM-IV-TR criteria. Thirty-two subjects were excluded for head movement exceeding 4.7 mm in any of the 6 directions during the scan sessions (Control group:   N   = 9, AH group:   N   = 6, 22q11.2DS group:   N   = 17). In the Control group, we excluded subjects with maladaptive functioning above the clinical cut-off of the Internalizing and Externalizing scales (  t  -score >64) in the Youth Self-Report and Adult Behavior Checklist (Achenbach,  ,  ) (  N   = 1). After excluding these 33 subjects, the 47 remaining youths were distributed in the following three groups: typically developing adolescents (Control group:   N   = 22), adolescents with transient AHs (AH group:   N   = 12) and adolescents with a 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS group:   N   = 13). \n",

      "Out of the 22 subjects in the Control group (mean age: 16.00,   SD   = 2.04, 16 males), 6 were recruited within the siblings of 22q11.2DS participants and 16 from the Geneva state school system. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the AH group, 12 subjects with subclinical AHs (mean age: 15.97,   SD   = 2.12, 5 males) were recruited through patient associations, by word of mouth or through the Child and Adolescents Outpatient Public Service (Office Médico-Pédagogique). Subjects were selected on the basis of a positive answer (yes or no) on the Cardiff Anomalous Perceptions Scale (CAPS) items describing AH items [i.e., items 3, 7, 11, 13, 28, or 32; (Bell et al.,  ; Debbané et al.,  ); see Table  ]. If they answered positively to an item, they were asked to rate their distress, the intrusiveness and the frequency of the experience by circling a number between 1 (not at all) and 5 (very). \n",

      "In the 22q11.2DS group, all adolescents (mean age: 16.14,   SD   = 2.55, 9 males) were recruited through parent associations in France, Belgium and Switzerland. The 22q11.2 deletion was confirmed using DNA polymorphism analysis based on short sequence repeats or by fluorescence in situ hybridization performed on metaphase spreads spanning the deleted region. \n",
      "\n",
      "Written informed consent was accepted by all parents and/or subjects under protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Geneva University School of Medicine. The three groups (Control, AH and 22q11.2DS) did not significantly differ according to age and gender (  p   > 0.05). At the time of testing, no participants were receiving psychotropic medication (data for this was missing for one subjects in the 22q11.2DS group). All participants underwent the Block Design subtest (Kohs,  ) in order to assess intellectual scores. \n",

      "A total of sixty-six female participants took part in this study. Thirty-one individuals with a current diagnosis of AN according to DSM-IV criteria were recruited from the hospital and community services of the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) National Health Service Trust and from an online advertisement on the b-eat website (Beating Eating Disorders — ), the UK's largest eating disorder charity (inpatients = 9, outpatients = 8, daycare patients = 7, community = 7). Twenty-five (81%) were diagnosed as restrictive (AN-R) and six (19%) as binge-purging (AN-BP). Fourteen (45%) reported taking antidepressant (SSRI = 12, SNRI = 1) or anti-anxiety medication. Thirty-five age-matched healthy individuals with no personal or family history of eating disorders were recruited from the community, staff and students of the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London. Two healthy participants were excluded from further analysis due to currently taking antidepressant medication and two were excluded for optimal matching of the two groups in terms of age and IQ. Body mass index  , medication, age of onset and duration of illness were obtained on the day of testing. The screening module of the research version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM disorders (SCID-I/P) ( ) was used as a screening tool for the healthy controls (HC). The National Adult Reading Test (NART) was used to estimate IQ ( ). Participants consent was obtained according to the Declaration of Helsinki (BMJ 1991; 302: 1194) and was approved by the National Research Ethics Committee London Bentham (11-LO-0952). \n",

      "A total of 2846 individuals completed online behavioral tasks using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk ( ). Data from 61 participants were discarded due to technical errors, incomplete submissions, or missed catch trials. Of the remaining 2785 participants, 1185 completed the visual similarity rating task (616 males, 569 females; age range = 18–53; mean age = 30.1), and 1600 completed the semantic feature generation task (852 males, 748 females; age range = 18–58 years; mean age = 31.7). These sample sizes are proportionally in line with those reported by  . Individuals who completed the visual similarity rating task were excluded from completing the feature generation task, and vice versa. All participants provided informed consent and were compensated for their time. Both online tasks were approved by the University of Toronto Ethics Review Board. \n",

This sample size is in line with extant fMRI studies that have used comparable analytical procedures to test hypotheses pertaining to object representation in the ventral visual stream and ATL ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ; ;  ;  ). Due to technical problems, we were unable to obtain data from one experimental run in two different participants. No participants were removed due to excessive motion using a criterion of 1.5 mm of translational displacement. All participants gave informed consent, reported that they were native English speakers, free of neurological and psychiatric disorders, and had normal or corrected to normal vision. Participants were compensated $50. This study was approved by the Baycrest Hospital Research Ethics Board. \n",

      "Thirty-six right-handed subjects participated in this study after giving written informed consent, including 14 patients with AD, 8 patients with MCI and 14 healthy controls. This study was approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee of Xuanwu Hospital. The AD and MCI subjects were recruited from patients who had consulted the memory clinic at Xuanwu Hospital for memory complaints. The healthy elderly controls were recruited from the local community. \n",
      "\n",
      "All AD patients underwent a complete physical and neurological examination, standard laboratory tests and an extensive battery of neuropsychological assessments. The diagnosis of AD fulfilled the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition criteria for dementia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994), and the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria for possible or probable AD (McKhann et al., 1984). The subjects were assessed with the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score  , CDR of 1 and 2 was assigned to the AD category. \n",
      "\n",
      "Participants with MCI had memory impairment but did not meet the criteria for dementia. The criteria for identification and classification of subjects with MCI   was: a) impaired memory performance on a normalized objective verbal memory test; b) recent history of symptomatic worsening in memory; c) normal or near-normal performance on global cognitive tests (MMSE score>24), as well as on an activities of daily living scale; (d) global rating of 0.5 on the CDR Scale, with a score of at least 0.5 on the memory domain; e) absence of dementia. \n",
      "\n",
      "Healthy controls met the following criteria: a) no neurological or psychiatric disorders such as stroke, depression and epilepsy; b) no neurological deficiencies such as visual or hearing loss; c) no abnormal findings such as infarction or focal lesion in conventional brain MR imaging; d) no cognitive complaints; e) MMSE score of 28 or higher; f) CDR score of 0. \n",
      "\n",
      "Participants with contraindications for MRI such as pacemaker, cardiac defibrillator, implanted material with electric or magnetic system, vascular clips or mechanical heart valve, cochlear implant or claustrophobia were excluded. In addition, patients with a history of stroke, psychiatric diseases, drug abuse, severe hypertension, systematic diseases and intellectual disability were excluded. \n",

      "A total of 70 healthy adults (age range 21–50 years, 41 males) participated in a 5-day and 4-night in-laboratory controlled sleep deprivation experiment , including 54 adults in the experimental group with one night of TSD (Fig.  ) and 16 adults in the control group without sleep loss (Fig.  ). Fifteen participants in the TSD group and one participant in the control group were excluded due to head motion, MR hardware problem, falling asleep during the scans, and/or missing behavioral data. Thus, fifty-four participants (age range 21–50 yrs, 28 males) were included in the present study, including 39 in the TSD group (mean age = 33.5 ± 8.8 yrs, 22 males) and 15 in the control group (mean age = 34.5 ± 9.0 yrs, 7 males). The sleep-wake schedule of each participant was assessed by at least one week actigraphy, sleep-wake diaries, sleep and circadian rhythm questionnaires, and a night of laboratory polysomnography and oximetry measurements during the weeks preceding the study. All participants had a regular sleep-wake schedule of nocturnal sleep duration between 6.5 and 8.5 hours, regular bedtime between 2200–0000 h and wake time of 0600–0900 h, and no evidence of habitual napping or sleep disorders. Participants could not have participated in trans-meridian travel or shift work, nor had irregular sleep-wake routines for 60 days prior to the in-lab study. Caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, medications (except 4 subjects took oral contraceptives and one subject took Mirena for birth control) or other psychoactive substances were prohibited from the week prior to and during the in-laboratory study. All participants were right-handed, not current smokers, and had no history of chronic physical or mental illness, as established by interviews, questionnaires, physical examinations, and blood and urine tests. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Pennsylvania and was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent before enrollment and were compensated for participating in the study. \n",

      "A group of 38 participants, comprising younger and older adults, took part in the fMRI experiment. Three participants (one younger adult and two older adults) were excluded from statistical analyses after medical examination of their anatomical scans in which structural abnormalities were diagnosed that might have an influence on their functional images. In addition, one younger adult was excluded due to experience in professional modern dance for six years in adolescence. The final sample consisted of 19 younger (14 women, mean age = 22.6±2.27 years, range 18–27) and 15 older adults (10 women, mean age = 61.1±5.68 years, range 51–71),   t  (32) = 24.7,   p  <0.001. The majority of the participants already took part in the behavioral action prediction experiment reported in Diersch et al.  . One younger adult and four older adults were additionally recruited from the participant database of the MPI for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig. Before scanning, these participants were invited for a separate testing session in which they completed the relevant questionnaires and performed the behavioral action prediction task to ensure that the whole sample was scanned under the same prerequisites. Time between the two experimental sessions was 5.35 months on average (range 3–8 months). Characteristics of the sample divided by age group are shown in  . \n",

      "All participants were right-handed according to the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory   and reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision. None of the participants reported current evidence of any major physical or neurological disease and/or use of medication that might affect blood flow. In addition, participants completed different psychometric tests to ensure that only healthy older adults would be included in the experiment. This allowed an examination of age-related changes in action prediction that are unlikely to be confounded by the effects of any age-associated pathology. None of the older adults showed indications of cognitive impairment as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE;  ; Maximum score: 30). The groups did not differ with respect to their reported years of education,   t  (32) = 0.68,   p   = 0.500. In addition, fluid intelligence (processing speed) was assessed by means of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), a subscale of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III;  ). Older adults obtained lower DSST raw scores than younger adults,   t  (32) = 5.53,   p  <0.001, in line with other cognitive aging studies (e.g.,  ). The groups did not differ from each other, when compared with norms appropriate to the participants' age group,   t  (32) = 1.09,   p   = 0.286. Crystallized intelligence (verbal knowledge) was assessed by means of the Spot-the-Word Test (SWT;  ). In accordance with Park et al.  , no age-related differences were found, both   t  ≤0.46,   p  ≥0.648. \n",

      "With respect to the action sequences used in the experiment, all participants confirmed that they were well able to perform the movement exercises. In addition, 10 of the 34 participants were highly experienced in figure skating (six younger adults and four older adults). The six younger figure skaters (5 women,   M =   21.2,   SD   = 2.23, range 18–24 years) spent on average 11.7 hours per week (  SD   = 7.06) on ice for 14.8 years (  SD   = 2.64). The four older figure skaters (3 women,   M   = 56.0,   SD   = 5.60, range 51–64 years) still performed the sport on a regular basis with 3.50 hours per week (  SD   = 1.29) on ice for 35.0 years (  SD   = 22.4). Two of them pursued a professional career for a period of 14.0 years (  SD   = 6.69) with 14.8 hours per week (  SD   = 7.41) on ice but ended it around the age of 22.7 years (  SD   = 11.0).

      "Seven healthy male right-handed subjects aged from 21 to 28 years (23.5 yo ± 2.5) were involved in this study. All subjects gave written informed consent before participating in the study. We have maintained the homogeneity of the population in order to limit the influence of factors, such as gender or age. \n",

      "### 2.2. MR Acquisitions \n",
      "  \n",
      "The subjects were scanned on a 3.0T whole body Siemens MR scanner (Magnetom Verio, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) with a 32-channel head coil. A 3D anatomical T1-weighted MP2RAGE image was acquired for each subject. The resting-state ASL imaging was performed using a 2D EPI pseudo-continuous (pCASL) sequence. Subjects were asked to keep their eyes closed, to relax (mind-wandering), to lie still and to not fall asleep. We used common parameters reported in the literature: TR = 3,500 ms, FoV = 224 × 224 mm , TE = 12 ms, LD = 1,500 ms and a 1250 ms post-labeling delay (PLD) at the first slice (1712.5 ms at the median slice). Volumes were made of 24 slices of 64 × 64 voxels with 5 mm slice thickness with 20% gap for a total resolution of 3.5 × 3.5 × 6 mm . The number of volumes was 420 for a total duration of 24 min 30 s. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.3. Data Pre-processing \n",
      "  \n",
      "For each subject, the raw pCASL series is divided into 46 sub-series. The duration of these sub-series ranges from nearly 2 min (34 volumes) to 24 min 30 s (420 volumes) with a time step of 30 s. For the sake of simplicity, we will only mention rounded durations hereafter. All these subdivisions are made   before   any preprocessing: the preprocessing is done independently on each sub-series. For the preprocessing steps and their parameters, we chose the most common ones found in bibliography. While identifying the best preprocessing is still an open topic in rs-ASL in particular and in rs-fMRI in general (Gargouri et al.,  ), a general routine can be discerned in the literature. For the preprocessing steps, we used Matlab CONN toolbox ( ,  ) (Whitfield-Gabrieli and Nieto-Castanon,  ). Preprocessing starts with the realignment of the functional data. All the functional volumes are rigidly registered to the first one using SPM12 realign procedure (Andersson et al.,  ). Second step is the indirect normalization of the functional volumes (Nieto-Castanon,  ). It starts with the affine registration of the functional data, with the mean volume of the realigned series as the source image, on the anatomical 3D T1 using SPM12 inter-modality co-registration procedure with a normalized mutual information cost function. Then the anatomical image is registered on the MNI 152 template using SPM12 unified segmentation and normalization procedure (Ashburner and Friston,  ). In parallel, perfusion-weighted maps are computed using a surround subtraction on the realigned functional data. Both transformations (functional to structural, structural to MNI) are composed to register subtracted functional data on the MNI template. We then used Gaussian smoothing with a typical 6 mm FWHM radius (Alakörkkö et al.,  ) and pass-band filtering with a range from 0.005 to 0.1 Hz. Final denoising was made with aCOMPCOR, using five regressors for white-matter, five for cerebro-spinal fluid, and the 12 from the realignment step (Behzadi et al.,  ). All these steps are shown in  . \n",

      "Preprocessing starts with a realignment: all the functional volumes are registered with the first one. Second step is the indirect normalization of the functional volumes. The functional data is registered on the anatomical 3D T1 (a). Then the anatomical image is registered on the MNI 152 template (b). After a surround subtraction (c), transformations of (a) and (b) are composed to register functional data on the MNI template (d). We then used Gaussian smoothing with a typical 6 mm FWHM radius and pass-band filtering with a range from 0.005 to 0.1 Hz. Final denoising is made with COMPCOR. \n",

      "A total of sixty-six female participants took part in this study. Thirty-one individuals with a current diagnosis of AN according to DSM-IV criteria were recruited from the hospital and community services of the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) National Health Service Trust and from an online advertisement on the b-eat website (Beating Eating Disorders — ), the UK's largest eating disorder charity (inpatients = 9, outpatients = 8, daycare patients = 7, community = 7). Twenty-five (81%) were diagnosed as restrictive (AN-R) and six (19%) as binge-purging (AN-BP). Fourteen (45%) reported taking antidepressant (SSRI = 12, SNRI = 1) or anti-anxiety medication. Thirty-five age-matched healthy individuals with no personal or family history of eating disorders were recruited from the community, staff and students of the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London. Two healthy participants were excluded from further analysis due to currently taking antidepressant medication and two were excluded for optimal matching of the two groups in terms of age and IQ. Body mass index  , medication, age of onset and duration of illness were obtained on the day of testing. The screening module of the research version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM disorders (SCID-I/P) ( ) was used as a screening tool for the healthy controls (HC). The National Adult Reading Test (NART) was used to estimate IQ ( ). Participants consent was obtained according to the Declaration of Helsinki (BMJ 1991; 302: 1194) and was approved by the National Research Ethics Committee London Bentham (11-LO-0952). \n",

      "Seventy (23 young people with a history of childhood abuse, 20 psychiatric controls, and 27 healthy controls) right-handed, medication-naïve, drug-free and age-matched young people came to the laboratory for two sessions, and those below the age of 18 were accompanied by their guardians on both visits. In the first visit, demographic, clinical and abuse measures and IQ data were collected and the participants were acclimated to the scanner environment with an MRI replica. The fMRI sustained attention task was administered in the MRI scanner on the second visit. All participants were assessed by a child psychiatrist (KM) using the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) [ ] designed to generate ICD-10 and DSM-IV psychiatric diagnoses. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires (SDQ) [ ] and Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI) [ ] were used to provide psychopathology symptom scores. IQ was assessed using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) [ ]. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) [ ] was used to measure the severity of childhood physical, emotional and sexual abuse as well as emotional and physical neglect. Socioeconomic status (SES) was measured by two non-sensitive items from the Family Affluence Scale (FAS) [ ] on housing tenure and room occupancy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Exclusion criteria for all participants were childhood sexual abuse, drug abuse, learning disability, neurological abnormalities, epilepsy, IQ < 70 and MRI contraindications. Urine screening for recent drug use was conducted with 10-panel urine drug test integrated cups (T-Cup;  ). All participants or their guardians if the participant was under the age of 18, provided written informed consent to participate in the study. Young people below the age of 18 were accompanied by their guardians during each visit and their guardians received the reimbursement for participating in the study on their behalf.

      "The 23 young people who experienced childhood physical abuse before the age of 12 were recruited through social services and psychiatric clinics. These young people, or their guardians if they were below the age of 18, were first asked to provide signed permission to contact their respective social services for written confirmation that there were official records of physical abuse. Next, the young people went on to complete the clinical interviews, abuse measures and IQ test and finally followed by the brain scan. The Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse (CECA) interview [ ] was used to corroborate the CTQ and provide additional information on the abuse experience such as the age or onset and duration of abuse. All the participants with a history of childhood abuse scored ≥ 13 (i.e. the cut-off for severe/extreme physical abuse) [ ] on the CTQ physical abuse subscale, and information from the CECA interview [ ] and the CTQ were consistent with the official records. Psychiatric comorbidities included PTSD, depression, anxiety, conduct disorder and phobia. Two participants were excluded due to MRI motion artefacts, leaving a final sample of 21 participants (mean age 17.5, 15 male). \n",

      "Taking an 8-year-old girl with autism, numbered 50,795 in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset, as an example, this paper analyzes the custom template in the form of slices. The fMRI data size of the subject is  . After discarding the data images of the first four time points and eliminating the invalid data whose head movement exceeds the limit at two time points, the final effective data are  , and the size of the final built custom template is  , as shown in  . \n",
      "\n",
      "The custom template has individual pertinence, that is, it is constructed by using the subjects’ fMRI sequence. Therefore, the constructed custom template is related to the subjects’ age and brain structure, and the subjects are different from each other.   shows the fMRI data of four example subjects with autism at five different time points and the custom built template in which sub50795 is an 8-year-old girl, sub50625 is a 7-year-old boy, sub51581 is a 64-year-old man, and sub50526 is a 50-year-old man. According to the sagittal diagram of the fMRI data of the four subjects, it can be found that there are very obvious differences in the brain structure, size, and development between the children and the adults. The user-defined fMRI template constructed for each subject retains the information contained in the images at different time points in the sequence data of the subjects to the greatest extent, especially for sub51581 and sub50526 of the two adults. Therefore, in the registration based on a single subject, it is more appropriate and reasonable to register the fMRI sequence data to the user-defined fMRI template than to randomly select the data at a certain time point as the reference image. \n",
      "\n",
      "In order to verify the accuracy and rationality of the custom fMRI template, this paper uses several classical registration algorithms to evaluate the accuracy of the custom fMRI template. Under the two conditions of using the randomly selected time-point image as the reference image (in this experiment, the image of the first effective time point is directly used as the randomly selected time point) and using the user-defined fMRI template as the reference image, the registration accuracy of the fMRI sequence registration of the same subject is compared. In the experiment, the measurement value between the two images after the registration is calculated. And then, the average value is taken for display. Because both the image to be registered and the reference image are fMRI modes, the registration effect is evaluated by using the Mean Square Error (MSE), Advanced Normalized Correlation (NCC), Advanced Mattes Mutual Information (MI), and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), commonly used to evaluate a single-mode registration. The matching criteria are to find the maximum correlation between the template and each subgraph, that is, the registered image. All the valid time-point data of 1114 subjects were registered with templates, and the average value of the evaluation indexes was displayed. \n",
      "\n",
      "The smaller the mean square error (MSE), the better the registration effect. It can be observed from   that the self-defined fMRI template is used as the reference template for registration on the Affine, SyN of ANTs [ ], and VoxelMorph registration algorithms based on deep learning [ ]. The registration accuracy has been improved to varying degrees compared with using the randomly selected image at a certain   fMRI volume (the first effective time point is directly used in this experiment) as the reference template for registration. \n",
