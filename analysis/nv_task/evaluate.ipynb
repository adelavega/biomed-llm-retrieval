A functional sequence was added to each functional imaging session performed in our lab (Figure  ), taking advantage of the continuous flow of volunteers recruited for various protocols. Because we wanted to capture the maximal amount of functional information in the minimum amount of time, we designed the sequence according the following challenging constraints: \\n\\n‚ñ™ the sequence had to be short, so as to disrupt as little as possible the main protocol. We choose 5 minutes for performing 100 trials. \\n\\n‚ñ™ we aimed to obtain for each subject a description of different levels of functional architecture, from sensori-motor areas (perception and action) to more associative areas involved in reading, language processing and calculation. \\n\\n‚ñ™ we aimed to capture in 5 minutes most of the individual networks related to each task. \\n\\n‚ñ™ individual networks described in 5 min had to be reproducible over sessions and time. \\n\\nThe feasibility of using short stimulation designs (ranging from 10 to 25 min long) to reveal individual functional maps has been previously assessed for language mapping [ ], for visual areas [ ] and recently for a set of functional networks covering sensorimotor processes, working memory, executive functions and emotional processes [ ]. Beyond that point, the main goal of the current study was to use the data obtained with this fMRI protocol with individual subjects as the cornerstone of a large-scale hybrid database. Because the individual functional information that can be captured in such a short sequence should be considered with caution, we focus here on the design efficiency and within-subject. We then describe preliminary data obtained from 81 subjects scanned in a 3T scanner and address new methodological issues including statistical methods for analysis and visualization of inter-individual functional variability. Subsequent publications will exploit the potential of this database to focus on characterizing inter-individual variability. '],\n",

In both conditions participants saw different pairs of shapes (Non-Targets, NT) appearing on the screen divided by a vertical line; the pairs could be: a circle and a square, a circle and a triangle, or a square and a triangle for a total of 6 possible pairs (two different left/right configurations for each). The pairs never had shapes of the same kind (e.g. a square and a square). In both tasks a block of NT was followed by target requiring participants to make a manual response. The target was a small stimulus presented in either blue or red and the colour was counterbalanced across participants. In the 0-back condition the target was flanked by one of two shapes and participants had to indicate by pressing the appropriate button which shape matched the target shape. In the 1-back condition, the target was flanked by two question marks and participants had to respond depending on which side the target shape was on the prior trial. For the behavioural study responses were made using the left and right arrow keys, for the neuroimaging study responses were made using a button box.

The word list for the task consisted of 110 kana nouns obtained from the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone corporation (NTT) psycholinguistic database called \"Lexical Properties of Japanese\" [ ]. Words were matched on linguistic parameters including word frequency, imagability, number of syllables, and key positions on the QWERTY keyboard so as not to require unequal hand usage. All words consisted of four or five kana characters (seven to nine alphabetic characters) and did not include the Roman characters q, w, z, x, c, v, p, or l, because there are relatively few opportunities to press these keys in the Japanese language and these characters are located in the corners of the QWERTY keyboard ( ). No word was shown more than once in the experiment (i.e., the six scanning sessions containing the writing, reading, and the typing conditions). \\n   Positions of the keys required to type the words included in the word list.  \\nThe typing task required the subjects to type the letters corresponding to the red colored keys. The keys q, w, z, x, c, v, p, and l were excluded because there are few opportunities to press these keys for Japanese typists and these keys are located in the corners of the QWERTY keyboard. \\n  \\nBefore the typing task, a picture of a hand, which indicated that the subject should type, was presented for 2000 ms followed by six different words presented sequentially over a period of 18000 ms with no interval and subjects were instructed to type each word on the keyboard ( ). We adopted the most popular way of typing Japanese called ‚Äúalphabetical input‚Äù. In this method, a western-style keyboard is used, and the kana character ‚Äúka‚Äù is produced by typing ‚Äúk‚Äù followed by ‚Äúa‚Äù [ ]. Although there are other ways of typing, all subjects were instructed to type using the alphabetical input method. \\n\\nThe keys pressed were recorded through the optical fibers placed in the keyboard buttons and the accuracy of typewriting was calculated offline. The percentage of left-hand and right-hand usage on the keyboard was calculated for each word to ensure that there was no bias in hand use. Behavioral data obtained from the typing experiment were processed in MATLAB 7.7.0 (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA). Accurate trials were defined as those for which subjects produced the correct key-pressing sequence for a given word. We were primarily interested in spelling errors as opposed to typing errors such as a slip in a keypress to the adjacent key, and we therefore did not consider key presses that were either one to the right or left of the correct key to be incorrect (e.g. for the letter ‚Äúy‚Äù, ‚Äút‚Äù or ‚Äúu‚Äù were considered correct). Typing speed (number of keys per second) was calculated offline to check the difference between consecutive key presses for each trial involving a motor control task. \\n',\n",

In a target trial, female participants judged the gift attractiveness (1: the least attractive, 9: the most attractive). In a control trial, the participants simply pressed the button when a white dot appeared by the side of the portrait. For details, see  . \\n  \\nIn each target trial, a portrait of a giver, a picture of a gift, and a rating scale were displayed simultaneously ( ). The participants used a keypad to rate the attractiveness of the gift. The keypad was separated for the left and right hands. The left five fingers corresponded to the ratings 1‚Äì5 and the four right fingers, except the little finger, corresponded to the ratings 6‚Äì9. The participants had practiced to press buttons correctly before the task. Gift attractiveness and reaction time (RT) for judgments were recorded. We conducted control trials to subtract brain activity on simply viewing the giver and pressing the buttons. In each control trial, a white dot appeared either on the left or on the right side of the portrait ( ). The participants pressed the button with the left/right index finger if the dot appeared on the left/right. \\n'],\n",

However, in contrast to earlier versions of the SNPT [ ‚Äì ], the SNPT-R uses only personal stories in order to maximize personal involvement of the participants while reading the stories ',\n",
       "   'During the story-reading phase (1), participants read stories consisting of a stem sentence and an ending sentence, describing either a neutral social situation, a situation in which a social norm was unintentionally transgressed or situation in which a social norm was violated intentionally. Participants were instructed to imagine themselves in the situation described. In the rating phase (2), participants rated all stories on embarrassment and inappropriateness. \\n  \\nIn the story-reading phase, participants read short stories written in second person. Each story consisted of two sentences, a stem sentence (duration: 3 s) and an ending sentence (duration: 6 s). The stories described either a situation in which no social norm was transgressed (‚Äúneutral condition‚Äù), a situation in which a social norm was unintentionally transgressed (‚Äúunintentional condition‚Äù) or a situation in which a social norm was intentionally transgressed (‚Äúintentional condition‚Äù). It is important to note that the unintentional (‚ÄúYou are baking with friends. You use salt instead of sugar without realizing.‚Äù) and intentional (‚ÄúYou are baking with friends. You use salt instead of sugar as a joke.‚Äù) condition differ only in the intention of the actor, while we aimed to keep the actual outcome of the action (for example, a distasteful cake) in general the same (although the outcome of some intentional stories could be considered to be more severe in comparison to the outcome of the matching unintentional story, inherent to the verb used to describe intentionality; we refer the reader to   for a sensitivity analysis). \\n\\nThe stories in the SNPT-R were developed in collaboration with Karina S. Blair, author of previous work on the SNPT [ ]. All stories described everyday social situations, in which the protagonist was accompanied by at least one other person, and the stories outlined relative innocuous violations of conventional social norms, in which no severe harm was done to others. The stories were heterogeneous with respect to the context (for example, in the presence of one friend or in public space like an airport) and the nature of the social norm transgression (for example, breaking decency rules versus hurting somebody), in order to increase the external validity of the paradigm. Stories were developed to be suitable for a broad audience and age-range (for children from age 8). However, given the fact that the stories of the SNPT-R were all personal (written in ‚Äòyou‚Äô form) in order to maximize personal involvement of participants, some small changes were necessary in stories describing age- or genderspecific elements. Therefore, four age- and gender specific versions of the task were developed: for boys < 18 years of age (version 1), girls < 18 years of age (version 2), men ‚â• 18 years of age (version 3) and women ‚â• 18 years of age (version 4). For example, the school environment (< 18 years) was replaced for a work environment (‚â• 18 years of age), and ‚Äòbikini bottoms‚Äô (females) for ‚Äòswimming trunks‚Äô (males). However, these changes were only minimal (see   and osf.io/m8r76 for a full list of stories included in the SNPT-R [ ]). \\n\\nIn line with the SNPT described by Blair et al. [ ], twenty-six stem sentences were developed, with three different types of ending. Therefore, the SNPT-R consisted of 78 short stories in total. These stories were presented in a pseudo-random order using E-Prime software (version 2.0.10, Psychology Software Tools; script available at osf.io/m8r76 [ ]), separated by a fixation cross (jittered duration between 2‚Äì7 s, determined using Optseq software ( ), mean duration fixation: 3.5 s) and divided into two consecutive blocks of 39 stories (duration each block: 8 min 44 s). Participants were instructed to imagine themselves in the social situations described and to press a button with their right index finger after reading the stem sentence of each story. A button press within 3 s resulted in visual feedback to the participant (a green checkmark presented beneath the sentence). This element was added to the paradigm in order to be able to check whether participants engaged with the task. Prior to the start of the experiment, all participants were familiarized with the story-reading phase by performing a short version of the task (using 5 stories). \\n\\nIn the (unannounced) rating phase of the task ( ), participants read all stories again and were asked to rate them on a 5-point Likert scale on embarrassment (ranging from 1, not embarrassing at all, to 5, extremely embarrassing) and inappropriateness (ranging from 1, not inappropriate at all, to 5, extremely inappropriate), similar as in the SNPT described by Blair and colleagues [ ]. These tasks were also presented using E-Prime software (version 2.0.10, Psychology Software Tools; scripts available at osf.io/m8r76 [ ]). '],\n",

Subvocalization, in which participants say the color of the ink in their heads rather than out loud, is a commonly used approach in developmental neuroimaging studies of cognitive control [ , ] because it helps minimize movement-related artifacts. On the other hand, the technique makes it inherently difficult to ensure that the participant is correctly completing the task. Therefore, extensive pre-scanning training was conducted and in-scanner response times between the conditions were evaluated to have on objective measure of whether the participant was indeed performing the task. Prior to scanning, participants practiced the task in a lab testing room. First, the child was presented with 3 blocks (1 congruent, 2 incongruent with 4 trials in each) and was instructed to say the color of the written word aloud.

On every trial, subjects chose between one of 90 food items presented on-screen (4 s) and a default food chosen prior to scanning ( ). Subjects responded by pressing one of four buttons corresponding to ‚Äòstrong yes‚Äô, ‚Äòyes‚Äô, ‚Äòno‚Äô, ‚Äòstrong no‚Äô (displayed at the bottom of the screen), using a button box placed in their right hand. The assignment of choice preferences to buttons was fixed throughout the task and the right-left orientation of the scale was counterbalanced across subjects. Inter-trial intervals varied from 1 to 4 s (average of 2 s), during which a white fixation cross was presented against a black background. After scanning, one trial was randomly drawn to determine what the subject would eat before leaving the lab. If subjects failed to respond within the 4 s of the selected trial either the on-screen or the default option was randomly chosen. \\n\\nSubjects made food choices under three conditions:   Respond Naturally   (‚Äòrespond as you naturally would‚Äô, [NC]),   Focus on Health   (‚Äòfocus on the healthiness of the food when making the choice‚Äô, [HC]), or   Focus on Taste   (‚Äòfocus on the tastiness of the food when making the choice‚Äô, [TC]) (see Appendix 1 ‚Äì Instructions for regulatory conditions in both choice tasks for instructions). Importantly, subjects were explicitly instructed to always make the decision based on their preference, regardless of the condition. Every condition comprised nine blocks (with 10 trials per block), resulting in a total of 90 trials per condition. Prior to every block, detailed instructions appeared for 4 s. In addition, during food display, a short description (‚ÄòRespond Naturally‚Äô, ‚ÄòFocus on Health‚Äô, ‚ÄòFocus on Taste‚Äô) appeared at the top of the screen to remind participants of the current instruction. Each of the nine functional scanning runs contained one block of every condition (i.e., three task blocks per run), with the order of conditions randomized across runs and subjects. The only exception was the first task block, which was pre-assigned to ‚Äònatural‚Äô for every subject. Practice trials as well as a short quiz prior to scanning ensured that subjects understood the instructions for each condition and were comfortable with the timing of the task. \\n\\nFood items varied in their perceived tastiness and healthiness and included healthy snacks (e.g., apples, broccoli) and junk foods (e.g., candy bars, chips). Items were selected based on subjects ratings in a self-paced computerized task prior to scanning that assessed perceived tastiness (5-point Likert scale, ‚Äòvery untasty‚Äô to\\xa0‚Äòvery tasty‚Äô) and healthiness (5-point Likert scale, ‚Äòvery unhealthy‚Äô to ‚Äòvery healthy‚Äô) of 200 food items ( ;  ). Ninety food items were selected from this larger set to cover the range of health and taste ratings in a roughly uniform manner. In addition, for each subject we chose one default food that was perceived as neutral for taste and health. Each food item was presented once in each of three choice conditions, with presentation order randomized across blocks, functional runs, and subjects. To ensure the motivational saliency of the food items, subjects were asked to refrain from eating 4 hr prior to testing. Stimulus presentation was implemented using high-resolution color pictures (72 dpi) and Psychophysics Toolbox Version 3 ( ) together with Matlab (2014a). ',\n",

Payouts for self and other ranged from $0 to $40 and always involved a tradeoff between self and other (i.e. prizes for one individual were equal or less than the default, while prizes for the other individual exceeded the default). Thus, subjects always had to choose between acting altruistically (benefitting the other at a cost to oneself) or selfishly (benefitting oneself at a cost to the other) on every trial.

During the recall runs, the 55 paired and 40 unpaired sounds (randomly intermixed) were presented, panned 15¬∞ to either the left or the right using specialized audio software (Audacity,  ). Participants indicated the side on which the sound was louder. We presented each sound for 4\\u202fs, followed by a 1.5-second response period, during which the screen was blank and participants completed the sound localization judgment. A fixation period followed (jittered with a mean of 4\\u202fs, range: 1.5\\u202fs‚Äì10.4\\u202fs). At the beginning of the run, we instructed participants to wait until after the sound had ended to respond. Immediately following the scanning session, participants completed a post-scan questionnaire to assess their memory for the scenes. Participants heard all 95 sounds. After the presentation of each sound, participants reported: (1) whether they had remembered a picture when the sound was played during the sound localization task (yes/no), (2) how hard they tried to perform the sound localization task correctly (1\\u202f=\\u202fdid not try at all, 7\\u202f=\\u202ftried very hard), (3) how hard they tried to recall a picture during the scan (1\\u202f=\\u202fdid not try at all, 7\\u202f=\\u202ftried very hard), and (4) how vivid the memory of the picture was during the scan (1\\u202f=\\u202fnot at all vivid, 7\\u202f=\\u202fvery vivid). Lastly, we presented the 55 paired sounds a final time and participants provided a description of the picture originally paired with the sound. Two independent judges rated these descriptions for accuracy. In the case of disagreement, a third judge broke the tie. As described below, only paired sounds that elicited a memory without effort and unpaired sounds that did not elicit a memory and had no retrieval effort were analyzed. \\n'],\n",

       "  'TaskDescription': [\"The fMRI procedure was similar to the behavioral experiment, except that a reduced stimulus set was presented: ‚àí333, 0, PSS, and +333. The PSS values were obtained individually from the pre-fMRI experiment separately for SJ and TOJ. To be as accurate as possible the individual PSS conditions were selected as the closest COA level to that of the PSS value derived from the pre-fMRI data fits. Although COA levels in the pre-fMRI experiment were restricted to ¬±333, ¬±267, ¬±200, ¬±133, ¬±67, and 0 ms, COA values for the PSS condition in the fMRI experiment could be any COA level between 0 and ¬±333 in 16 ms increments i.e., one frame at a time. This use of an individually determined stimulus level (PSS) is similar to the approach used by Binder ( ) to determine stimuli levels, but did not use the simultaneity threshold approach based on separate sound-first and flash-first trials. For TOJ-unable participants, we used average results from a behavioral study using identical stimuli (Petrini et al.,  ). An optimized mixed block/event-related design was used to enable investigation of differences between the tasks at both transient and sustained levels of processing. \\n\\nEach of two functional runs (~22 min each) consisted of 32 stimulation blocks (half SJ and half TOJ, randomized) and after every two stimulation blocks there was a 16 s fixation block (Figure  ). Within a stimulation block (25 s) there were 9 events: 5 stimuli (each 3 s) separated by 4 fixation events (1, 2, 3, or 4 s in pseudorandom order). Each COA condition was presented a total of 40 times (20 per run) per task. To minimize the correlation between the transient (stimuli) and sustained (stimulation block) regressors the number of times an individual COA condition was presented within a single stimulation block was manipulated as follows: in a run, a COA level was presented 0 times during 4 stimulation blocks, once in 6 blocks, twice in 4 blocks and 3 times in 2 blocks, i.e., a total of 20 presentations for each COA level and task. One thousand sequences with different randomizations of the order of events and blocks were created and the best chosen by balancing efficiency and correlation. In the chosen sequence, the mean correlation between sustained and transient regressors was 0.47, which enabled reliable estimation of both types of BOLD response (Otten et al.,  ). \\n\\nAuditory stimuli were presented via Sensimetrics S14 insert headphones at approximately 85 dB. The visual cue was back-projected (Panasonic PT-D7700E DLP; 1,024 √ó 768 pixel resolution, 60 Hz refresh rate) onto a screen behind the participant's head, visible via a mirror mounted on the MR head coil with an approximate viewing distance of 65 cm. \"],\n",

The BART measures participants‚Äô willingness to engage in risky behavior in order to earn rewards, and is associated with real-life risk taking in adolescents  and adults . During the scan session, participants were presented with a sequence of 24 balloons that they could pump up to earn points. Each pump decision was associated with earning one point but also increased the risk that a balloon would explode. If participants pumped a balloon too many times, the balloon would explode and participants would lose all the points they had earned for that balloon. However, if participants chose to cash out before the balloon exploded, the points they earned would be added to the running total of points, which was presented on the screen as a points meter. Participants were instructed that their goal was to earn as many points as possible during the task. Each event (e.g., larger balloon following a pump, new balloon following cashed or explosion outcomes) was separated with a random jitter (500‚Äì4000\\u2009ms). Balloons exploded after 4 to 10 pumps, and the order of balloons was presented in a fixed order (after being pseudo-randomly ordered prior to data collection), although none of this information was made available to participants. The BART was self-paced and would not advance unless the participant made the choice to either pump or cash out. Participants were told that they could win a $10 gift card at the end of the neuroimaging session if they earned enough points during the task. The point threshold for winning this prize was intentionally left ambiguous so that participants were motivated to continue earning points throughout the task.

Stimulus presentation order was the same for each subject. Each stimulus lasted 956 msec in duration. Prior to each run, child participants were instructed to play the ‚Äòkitty cat game‚Äô during the fMRI scan. While laying down in the scanner, children were first shown a brief video of a cat and were told that the goal of the cat game was to listen to a variety of sounds, including ‚Äòvoices that may be familiar,‚Äô and to push a button on a button box only when they heard kitty cat meows (catch trials). The function of the ‚Äòcatch trials‚Äô was to keep the children alert and engaged during stimulus presentation. During each run, four or five exemplars of each stimulus type (i.e. nonsense words samples of mother‚Äôs and unfamiliar female voices, environmental sounds), as well as three catch trials, were presented. At the end of each run, the children were shown another engaging video of a cat. Although the button box failed to register responses during data collection in four children with ASD and nine TD children, data analysis of the catch trails for 17 children with ASD and 12 TD children showed similar catch trial accuracies between TD (accuracy\\xa0=\\xa091%) and ASD groups (accuracy\\xa0=\\xa089%; two-sample   t  -test results:   t  (2) = 0.35, p\\xa0=\\xa00.73).

Auditory stimuli were presented during silent intervals between volume acquisitions to eliminate the effects of scanner noise on auditory discrimination. One stimulus was presented every 3576 ms, and the silent period duration was not jittered. The total silent period between stimulus presentations was 2620 ms, and consisted of a 300 ms silent period, 2000 ms for a volume acquisition, another 300 ms of silence, and a 20 ms silent interval that helped the stimulus computer maintain precise and accurate timing during stimulus presentation.

Subjects are instructed to respond by indicating whether the word was a semantic match (50% of trials) or non-match (unmatched, 50% of trials) to the preceding picture. Pictures consisted of 102 line drawings selected from ( ) and classified into 10 natural categories (clothing, animal, bird, appliance, tool, vehicle, vegetable, fruit, toy, and musical instrument). The full set of pictures comprised a block of 102 trials which was repeated across a total of four blocks, with the order of pictures varying across blocks. Half of the unmatched trials comprised picture-word pairs from a related semantic category (related co-hyponym, e.g., APPLE ‚Üílemon) and the other half comprised picture-word pairs from unrelated semantic categories (unrelated, e.g., APPLE ‚Üícow). Subjects were not asked to distinguish between related and unrelated unmatched target words. Occasional null events were inserted between trials, resulting in trial-to-trial intervals that ranged from 3 to 11\\u202fs. Participants responded by button press with right or left index fingers to indicate if the word matched or did not match the picture. Left / right button presses were counterbalanced across participants. All participants performed several practice trials prior to ERP or fMRI recordings. No feedback was given to signal performance accuracy and participants were told to respond as quickly as possible without sacrificing accuracy. All subjects performed the task at >90% accuracy (See Supplementary Table 1. HC\\u202f=\\u202f95.0% and SZ\\u202f=\\u202f91.8%, F(1,45)\\u202f=\\u202f5.7295,   p  \\u202f=\\u202f0.02).

Moreover, there was no effect of session order or time between sessions on the loading weight of the joint component reported below (ANCOVA model with covariates of group, session order and times between sessions).

       "  'TaskDescription': ['During the event-related fMRI sessions, participants performed either purchasing or perceptual decisions in alternating blocks (Fig.\\xa0 ). Each good was presented twice: once during the purchasing decision and once during the perceptual decision. Before each block started, both blocks were cued visually so participants knew in which block they were performing. Hedonic and utilitarian goods were presented in a random order. There were four blocks, and each block had 76 stimuli.   \\nParticipants performed two types of task in relation to identical stimuli (book cover: hedonic/utilitarian). (  A  ) For purchasing decisions, participants indicated their willingness to pay a specific price for that book. (  B  ) For perceptual choices, participants indicated the total number of people and lines on the book cover. \\n  \\n\\nTo capture explicit hedonic/utilitarian values, we asked participants how much they would be willing to pay for the goods during purchasing decisions (willingness-to-pay: WTP), as previously described . We considered the WTP scores as the economic value of goods, and the WTP scores for hedonic/utilitarian goods as hedonic/utilitarian values, respectively. We also assumed that participants automatically calculate WTP without the need for purchasing behavior during exposure to the goods and, therefore, WTP reflects the explicit and task-irrelevant economic values of the goods during purchasing decisions . \\n\\nWe followed the Becker‚ÄìDegroot‚ÄìMarshak (BDM) auction method, which is widely used in economics to incentivize participants to reveal their true values for goods without actually providing all the selected goods . In brief, participants were given money (450 yen in our case) for purchasing decisions and state their WTP for each item. They placed bids on the goods from a range of prices (0 yen, 150 yen, 300 yen or 450 yen in our case) as the stated WTP. At the end of the experiment, one trial was randomly selected, and then the experimenter generated a random selling price (from a known distribution of 0 yen, 150 yen, 300 yen, and 450 yen with equal probability in our case). If the random selling price was less than or equal to their stated WTP, the participant could purchase the goods at the random selling price and kept the remaining money. If the selling price was greater than their WTP, the participant could not purchase the item and keeps the entire 450 yen. Therefore, participants‚Äô optimal strategy was to state their true value for goods on every trial. \\n\\nParticipants also performed perceptual decisions for a perceptual task. They viewed the cover of the book, and answered questions relating to perceptual levels: the total number of people and lines of the title in the book (by 2, 3, 4, or 5). Each book included at least one person and one line of title. They saw the same books during both decisions, but the order was pseudo-randomized to eliminate the order effects. Therefore, this procedure allowed motor responses and sensory input to be matched in both purchasing and perceptual tasks. '],\n",

In contrast, when the two selections did not match, the participant received nothing, while the opponent received 40 JPY for ‚Äòstar‚Äô or 20 JPY for ‚Äòdiamond‚Äô. Thus, the game payoff was asymmetric between the two players. We adopted this asymmetric payoff to make the game-theoretic probabilistic mixed strategy different from a random 50‚Äì50 choice; if the payoffs were symmetrical, it would be impossible to distinguish the game-theoretically rational strategy from a purely random choice ( ;  ).

On each trial, participants first viewed a behavior they previously rated (but were not reminded of their original ratings) (2 s). Following a jittered inter-stimulus interval (  M   = 2 s), participants were then shown their parents‚Äô and peers‚Äô ratings on each behavior and instructed to choose which person they agreed with most (maximum of 5 s). Participants pressed the left index finger when they agreed with their parent or right index finger when they agreed with their peer. Participants‚Äô choices were self-paced, such that the task advanced to the next behavior upon participant response. Behaviors were presented in random order and were separated by jittered inter-trial fixation periods (  M   = 2 s). Conformity was operationalized as choosing the person whose rating conflicted with the adolescent‚Äôs original rating, whereas resistance was operationalized as choosing the person whose rating was the same as the adolescent‚Äôs original rating (described below). \\n\\nIn order to examine decisions to conform in the face of conflicting attitudes, we tailored the task to each participant based on their ratings assessed during the behavioral session. Although we collected the parents‚Äô actual ratings during the behavioral session, and ostensibly collected peers‚Äô ratings, such ratings were not used as we carefully manipulated the ratings to fall within the attitude conflict and social influence conditions described below. Of the 200 behaviors that participants originally rated at the behavioral session, 120 behaviors were selected for the fMRI task based on two criteria. First, the participant‚Äôs rating for a behavior needed to fall between minimum and maximum plausible ratings determined for each behavior based on pilot data, thereby maximizing ecological validity and checking for deviant responding (e.g., rating ‚Äúcheating on a test‚Äù as 10=very good was outside the range of plausibility). Second, given that extreme ratings may be less likely to change ( ), the participant‚Äôs rating for a behavior could not fall at the extremes of the scale (i.e., 1 or 10), ensuring that their parents‚Äô and peers‚Äô ratings could be manipulated to be below, above, or centered at participants‚Äô original ratings. Thus, the strength of participants‚Äô original ratings was relatively moderate across the subset of behaviors included in the fMRI task, with a balanced distribution across constructive and unconstructive behaviors. \\n'],\n",

Participants viewed unhealthy craved foods (‚ÄúCraved‚Äù condition), unhealthy not-craved foods (‚ÄúNot Craved‚Äù condition), or healthy vegetables (‚ÄúNeutral‚Äù condition). For unhealthy craved foods, participants either actively viewed the foods (‚ÄúLook‚Äù condition) or reappraised their craving for them (‚ÄúRegulate‚Äù condition). On ‚ÄúLook‚Äù trials, participants imagined how they would interact with the food if it were in front of them. On ‚ÄúRegulate‚Äù trials, participants reappraised the foods by focusing on the short- or long-term negative health consequences associated with consumption (e.g., stomach aches, weight gain, cavities, etc.). Participants generated several negative health consequences with the help of the experimenter, to ensure they had multiple reappraisals they could use during the task. To minimize demand characteristics (e.g., reduced craving ratings on regulate trials), participants were reassured they were not expected to be able to regulate well on every trial and were told that it was important to rate their cravings honestly. Neutral stimuli were only viewed under ‚ÄúLook‚Äù instructions, and are not used in the present analyses. To keep task time to a minimum, only craved foods were viewed under ‚ÄúRegulate‚Äù instructions. \\n\\nTo maximize craving, participants selected their most craved and least craved food from the following menu of unhealthy food categories for the ‚ÄúCrave‚Äù and ‚ÄúNot Craved‚Äù conditions respectively: chocolate, cookies, donuts, French fries, ice cream, pasta, pizza. Stimuli were independently rated for desirability, such that the mean desirability of stimuli within each unhealthy food category did not differ significantly across categories ( ). As such, each participant viewed a set of individually adapted unhealthy food stimulus categories; across all participants, the only domain on which the ‚ÄúCraved‚Äù and ‚ÄúNot Craved‚Äù conditions differed was with regard to individual food preferences. Each condition (Look Neutral, Look Craved, Look Not Craved, and Regulate Craved) had 20 trials, presented across two task runs. On each trial (see  ), participants are presented with an instruction (2 s; Look or Regulate), viewed a food image while following the instruction (5 s), and rated their craving for the food on a 5-point Likert scale (4 s; 1 = not at all, 5 = very much). Each 11s trial of this event-related design was followed by a jittered fixation cross (  M   = 1 s) and trial order is optimized using a genetic algorithm ( ).

We optimized our task to allow mapping of a versatile number of contrasts that are relatively straightforward to interpret. To enable the separation of sensory-specific and sensory-unspecific activities (Wheeler et al.,  ; Daselaar et al.,  ; Langner et al.,  ), we used two sensory modalities, auditory and visual. Twenty-five percent of the total time consisted of passive rest blocks as baseline/rest condition (Gusnard and Raichle,  ). Each sensory condition contained two distinct sub-conditions to cover a wide range of information on visual and auditory system activations as well as joined activation for sensory-unspecific functions like overall memory. Within the visual condition, we chose to present faces and spatial scenes, motivated by work on face-selective and scene-selective brain regions (Kanwisher et al.,  ; Epstein and Kanwisher,  ; Gazzaley et al.,  ; Collins and Dickerson,  ).

Subjects were told to press a button as quickly as possible to collect the money (win) before the target box disappeared.

A premature button press prior to the appearance of the target box terminated the trial, and similarly resulted in loss.

In the first block, participants saw a fixation cross (1 s) followed by one video (3 s) and were asked to estimate the amount of pain experienced by the person in the video, by moving a randomly-presented rectangular cursor on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) ranging from ‚Äòno pain at all‚Äô (corresponding to value 1) to ‚Äòthe worst pain imaginable‚Äô (corresponding to value 10). Following the rating (7 s), participants were exposed to two simultaneous feedbacks (3 s) that represented the judgement of the   Target   of the video and the average judgement of 20 emergency doctors that previously rated the same video-clips. These two feedbacks were displayed by cursors similar to that of the participant but of different colors (color codes were randomized across participants). Each kind of feedback was independent and orthogonal as respect to the other and described pain levels, which could be higher, equal or lower, compared to the participant. This led to a 3 √ó 3 design, with nine different conditions. Feedbacks were located on the scale according to a normal distribution with mean\\xa0+2.2, 0 and ‚àí2.2 scale points for values higher, equal and lower ratings respectively, and\\xa0¬±0.5 as standard deviation that helped in providing an effect of variability consistent with that of a human judgement. In case the feedbacks had to appear out of the physical limit of the scale, they were instead displayed at the further extremity within the scale. Each video appeared just once (total number\\xa0=\\xa044) and was randomly assigned to one of the nine conditions. This led to eight conditions associated with five videos, and one condition associated with four videos (5  *  8\\xa0+\\xa04\\xa0  =  \\xa044).

Trials were structured as follows: First, an arrow (2000\\xa0ms) indicated the   target   (self vs. other) of the upcoming stimulus. The intensity of the upcoming stimulus was indicated by the color of this arrow (red: painful vs. green: nonpainful). After a jittered blank screen (3500\\u2009¬±\\u20091500\\xa0ms), the electrical stimulus (500\\xa0ms) was delivered during simultaneous presentation of another visual delivery stimulus (1000\\xa0ms). The latter consisted of a picture of the confederate‚Äôs face, shown with either a painful or a neutral expression, or, in case of self-directed stimulation, scrambled versions of these pictures were shown to control for visual stimulation. Depending on the stimulus category, these pictures were accompanied by either a red (painful) or green (nonpainful) flash in the lower right corner of the picture. The delivery cue was followed by a fixation cross (5000\\u2009¬±\\u20092500\\xa0ms), and an optional rating (self-directed: one rating question; other-directed: two rating questions; 6000-ms answering time per each question).

Ratings were collected in about one third of the trials in a pseudorandomized fashion. Between trials, a fixation cross (2000\\xa0ms) was presented. In sum, 15 trials per condition (i.e., self-directed pain/no pain; other-directed pain/no pain) were presented. Participants were instructed to empathize with the other person. ',\n",
       "   'Following the empathy for pain paradigm, we applied a touch paradigm ( ;  ) including 15 pleasant, 15 unpleasant and 15 neutral stimuli in pseudo-randomized order (see also  ). This paradigm consisted of two separate runs: In the first run (self-directed affective touch), the participant was stimulated to measure behavioral responses and brain activation related to the first-hand experience of affective touch. In the second run (empathy for affective touch) a confederate acting as a second participant was supposedly undergoing affective touch, and participants were instructed to empathize with her feelings. In every single self-directed trial, visual presentation of an object was accompanied by simultaneous stroking of the left palm at 1\\xa0Hz for 2\\xa0s in proximal-to-distal direction with a material whose touch resembled the touch of the object depicted on the screen. For example, touching the participant‚Äôs hand with down feathers was accompanied by the picture of a chick to elicit a pleasant affective touch experience. The stimuli had been selected in extensive pretesting based on maximum agreement among participants in terms of congruency between visual and somatosensory stimulus and emotional responses (see   for paradigm validation test). In one third of the trials (5 per condition), participants were asked to rate the stimulation in that trial on a 9-point scale ranging from very unpleasant (left extreme of the scale) to very pleasant (right extreme) for either themselves or, supposedly, for the other participant (i.e., the confederate). Each single trial consisted of a jittered fixation cross (5000\\u2009+\\u2009‚àí2000\\xa0ms), followed by visuo-tactile stimulation (2000\\xa0ms) and a jittered blank screen (1500\\u2009+\\u2009‚àí1000\\xa0ms).

Recent research supports flexible use of the TAP, as it has shown to be psychometrically robust to variations in sampling, laboratory settings, and analytical approaches ( ;  ). Participants were informed that they would play an online computerized game with a participant situated in another lab. Participants were told that they would compete in multiple trials of a reaction time competition, in which the loser of each trial received an aversive noise blast through headphones, at one of four noise levels chosen by the other player. In reality, participants played against a preset computer program designed to produce four volume levels of white noise, with volume settings ranging from 1 (60 dB) to 4 (105 dB), in 22.5 dB intervals. The TAP consisted of 16 trials ( ). Each trial began with a fixation phase, followed by a decision phase, in which participants selected the volume of noise blast that their partner would receive if their partner lost the reaction time trial. Participants then viewed a fixation cross with a jittered duration (0.5/1.0/1.5 s) before the competition phase, during which participants were required to quickly press a button when a red square target was shown on-screen (5 s). Participants then viewed their opponent‚Äôs (pre-programmed) volume setting. This time point of notification, when the participant perceived the opponent‚Äôs intended noise blast setting, was modeled as the provocation phase (see  ). Finally, in the outcome phase, participants learned whether they won or lost the trial. The ‚Äúlosing‚Äù outcome phase, modeled as the punishment phase, subjected participants to a 5 s noise blast delivered by their opponent. Trials were characterized as retaliatory if they followed trials with high provocation (noise levels 3 or 4) and non-retaliatory if they followed trials with low provocation (levels 1 or 2). The 16-trial task contained eight retaliatory and eight non-retaliatory trials that were randomized across participants. Wins and losses were also randomly ordered across participants. Participants practiced the task first outside of the scanner to provide an opportunity for subjective evaluation of each noise level prior to neuroimaging assessment. '],\n",

We also counterbalanced the demonstrators appearing in the genuine and pretended conditions across participants, thus controlling for differences in behavioral and brain response that could be explained by differences between the stimulus sets. Note that, all video clips were validated and piloted multiple times to ensure the experimental effect (details can be found in the section above). \\n\\nThe participant performed the fMRI experiment in two runs ( ). Each run was composed of two blocks showing genuine pain and two blocks showing pretended pain. In each block, the participant watched nine video clips containing both painful and neutral videos. To remind participants‚Äô the condition of the upcoming block, a label of 4 s duration appeared at the beginning of each block, showing either ‚Äògenuine‚Äô or ‚Äòpretended‚Äô (in German). Each trial started with a fixation cross (+) presented for 4‚Äì7 s (in steps of 1.5 s, mean = 5.5 s). After that, the video (duration = 2 s) was played. A short jitter was inserted after the video for 0.5‚Äì1.0 s (in steps of 0.05 s, mean = 0.75 s). After the jitter, the following three questions were displayed (in German) one after the other in a pseudo-randomized order: (1) How much pain did the person   express   on his/her face? (2) How much pain did the person   actually feel  ? (3) How   unpleasant did you feel   to watch the person in this situation? Beneath each question, a visual analog scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 8 (unbearable) with nine tick-marks was positioned. The participant moved the marker along the scale by pressing the left or right keys on the button box, and they pressed the middle key to confirm their answer. The marker initially was always located at the midpoint (‚Äò4‚Äô) of the scale. When the confirmed key was pressed, the marker turned from black to red. All ratings lasted for 4 s even when the participant pressed the confirmed key before the end of this period. Between the two runs, the participant had a short break (1‚Äì2 min). '],\n",

A visual cue then appeared for 340\\xa0ms on the screen. The cue was a central disc (54\\u2009√ó\\u200954 pixels, 1¬∞ visual angle) whose color (red or green) defined the nature of the saccadic task that should follow. A blank screen lasting 200\\xa0ms marked the transition between the visual cue (central disc) and the visual target stimulus (peripheral image) that was presented 10¬∞ to the left or 10¬∞ to the right of the screen center for 1000\\xa0ms. A green cue prompted the participants to look toward the appearing stimulus (prosaccade) and a red cue signaled that participants should look to the opposite side (to the mirror location) of the appearing stimulus (antisaccade). Participants were instructed to execute pro and antisaccades as quickly as possible. The experiment consisted of six 4-min long runs. Each run comprised 20 face and 20 car stimuli (40 trials in total) with 50% pro and 50% antisaccade instructions, randomized to the left and right hemi-field. We determined 6 different schedules (one for each run) using optseq2 (version 2.0, available at   http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/optseq  ), optimizing the order and timing of the 8 conditions (anti- or prosaccades toward faces or cars to the left or right side of the hemi field). The order of the 6 different schedules was counterbalanced across participants. We explained the task to the participants outside the scanner and had them perform a 2-min long practice session inside the scanner before the experiment started to ensure that the instruction was properly understood. Participants took breaks varying from a few seconds up to 2\\xa0min between runs, during which we reminded them of the instructions. '],\n",

Instead of memorizing and comparing unique items, as in the classical n‚Äêback task, the participants had to memorize and to compare the results of arithmetic operations, computed beforehand. Arithmetic operations were either additions or subtractions. All numbers were multiples of five (e.g., 15\\u2009+\\u200940, 90‚Äì35). The arithmetic operations (trials) were presented for 2.5\\xa0s, followed by an interstimulus‚Äêinterval of 0.5\\xa0s.

Participants divided 7 coins between themselves and another person - who could not reject the decision - in either a small or large giving condition. Giving was operationalized as the number of given coins. In the small giving condition, participants could give away 1, 2, or 3 out of 7 coins. In the large giving condition, participants could give away 4, 5, or 6 out of 7 coins. Participants could not give 0 coins, 7 coins, or make an equal split to warrant comparability between the small and large giving condition (see  ).   \\n(A) The small and large giving conditions of the task, in which participants could give away 1, 2, or 3 coins, or 4, 5, or 6 coins, respectively (depicted in orange). Participants would keep the remainder of the 7 coins (depicted in yellow) to themselves. The name of the target (which could either be a friend or unfamiliar peer) was displayed at the top of the screen for each trial. (B) In two out of four blocks of the giving task, participants made anonymous giving choices. In the other two blocks, participants were aware that the peer audience depicted on the screen would observe their choices later in time (i.e., the audience condition). Note that the screens indicating whether blocks were audience or anonymous were only displayed at the start of each block, not during trials. Audience and anonymous blocks were presented in counterbalanced order. \\n  Fig. 1   \\n\\n\\n#### Familiarity of the target: friend and unfamiliar peer \\n  \\nThe target of giving was either the participant‚Äôs closest friend (same-sex, similar-age) or an unfamiliar peer (same-sex, similar-age, anonymized participant of the same study). For each trial, the name of the target was displayed at the top of the screen (see  ). Participants were instructed that the coins they divided in each trial were worth actual money (i.e., 20 eurocents each) and that the computer would randomly select a few trials of the task to determine the payout of the participant, friend, and unfamiliar other. Accordingly, participants received a payment for themselves (  M   = ‚Ç¨.80,   SD   = ‚Ç¨.12) and their friend (  M   = ‚Ç¨.68,   SD   = ‚Ç¨.08), and experimenters transferred the payment to the unfamiliar other (i.e., another participant of the current study;   M   = ‚Ç¨.61,   SD   = ‚Ç¨.09). \\n\\n\\n#### Peer presence: anonymous and audience giving \\n  \\nTo assess the effects of peer presence on giving, the task consisted of two blocks in which participants made anonymous choices, and two blocks in which participants‚Äô choices were evaluated by peers later in time (see  ). The order of anonymous and audience blocks was counterbalanced across participants. In a practice session prior to the MRI session, participants viewed a video clip of six peers (three males and three females, aged 9‚Äì19) with neutral expressions. To the awareness of participants, these six peers were invited after study completion to observe and evaluate choices of participants. Trials in the anonymous blocks were not shown to anyone, as ‚Äì beknown to participants - experimenters covered the screen in the control room. '],\n",

A list of the researcher-selected musical selections is given in Supplementary Materials Table  . Stimuli were presented in a randomized order, and participants made ratings of familiarity and liking on the scales of 1 to 4: for familiarity: 1\\u2009=\\u2009very unfamiliar, 2\\u2009=\\u2009unfamiliar, 3\\u2009=\\u2009familiar, 4\\u2009=\\u2009very familiar; for liking: 1\\u2009=\\u2009hate, 2\\u2009=\\u2009neutral, 3\\u2009=\\u2009like, 4\\u2009=\\u2009love.

The yearbook photos (i.e., targets) used in the task were selected based on the sociometric data from the previous year (wave 1), because of the time required to process the sociometric data and create the scan task. However, we ran correlations between wave 1 and wave 2 for all four sociometric categories to establish that peer status was highly stable across years (i.e. High Popularity: r\\xa0=\\xa00.67, p\\xa0<\\xa0.001; Low Popularity: r\\xa0=\\xa00.76, p\\xa0<\\xa0.001; High Social Preference: r\\xa0=\\xa00.80, p\\xa0<\\xa0.001; Low Social Preference: r\\xa0=\\xa00.81, p\\xa0<\\xa0.001) in line with prior research ( ). To be selected as a target for the task, the peer needed to have a sociometric z-score between 1 and 5 (representing 1‚Äì5\\xa0SD above the mean on popularity/social preference in their school and grade) or between ‚àí\\xa01 and ‚àí\\xa05 (representing 1‚Äì5\\xa0SD below the mean on popularity/social preference in their school and grade). One version of the task was created for each grade level within each school (three middle schools, each with 2 grades, resulting in six versions total). The task had four conditions: High social preference (i.e., z-score between 1 and 5 on social preference), low social preference (i.e., z-score between ‚àí1 and ‚àí5 on social preference), high popularity (e.g., z-score between 1 and 5 on popularity), and low popularity (i.e., z-score between ‚àí1 and ‚àí5 on popularity). Within each condition, there were 10 targets, and we aimed for an equal number of boys and girls within each condition. Due to a data management error, z-scores for the targets from one of the schools (two of the six task versions) were incorrect and did not necessarily fall within the criteria (i.e., z-score between ¬±\\xa01 and 5). Popularity and social preference scores were recalculated for the target images in these task versions. For one group of participants (n\\xa0=\\xa020), there were a sufficient number of target images that still fit the criteria for each condition (High Popularity =\\xa09, Low Popularity =\\xa08, High Social Preference = 8, Low Social Preference =\\xa010), so these participants were included. For the other group, there were an insufficient number of target images fitting the criteria (e.g., as few as 5) in the conditions, so these participants (n\\xa0=\\xa015) were excluded. Across all versions of the task that were retained, the average z-score within each condition was approximately 2 (see supplement for details). There was no overlap in the targets across conditions, such that each target belonged in only one sociometric category and appeared in only one condition. No participants were included as targets so that no participant would see their own image. Target photos were obtained from school yearbooks from the previous school year, the same year the sociometric ratings were collected. Yearbook photos were digitized into JPEG images. '],\n",

Individual pain thresholds served as anchor for the subsequent calibration and matching procedures. During calibration, stimulus intensities for each pain modality were identified based on perceived pain intensity ratings within the target range of 60 to 80 mm on digitised visual analogue scales [VAS] with endpoints labelled ‚Äònot painful‚Äô [0] and ‚Äòextremely painful‚Äô [100], respectively. This procedure allows the determination of individual stimulation intensities [distension pressure for the visceral modality and temperature for the somatic modality] inducing adequately painful sensations for use in within-subject application of repeated pain stimuli during brain imaging. Afterwards, to ensure comparability across modalities, visceral and somatic perceived pain intensities were matched. For this purpose, visceral stimuli were presented together with thermal stimuli and participants were asked to compare the stimuli using Likert-type response options indicating more, less, or equally painful stimuli. If the rating showed a deviation, the intensity of thermal stimuli was successively adjusted until ratings indicated equal perception at least twice consecutively. As in our previous work,  stimulus durations were adjusted for each individual, aiming at matched durations of ascending [increasing pressure and temperature, respectively] and plateau phases [stable pressure and temperature, respectively] of visceral and thermal stimulation [total stimulus duration per stimulus: 20 s].

To enhance believability, participants created an online profile describing their interests and were told they would have their photograph taken. Participants then completed the selection phase whereby they viewed 60 photographs of mid- to late-adolescents (30 boys, 30 girls) and then placed 30 peers into an ‚Äúinterested‚Äù (liked) and 30 into a ‚Äúnot interested‚Äù (unliked) onscreen bin. Peer photographs were taken from stimulus sets used in past studies (e.g.,  ). Participants were told the other peers would indicate whether they wanted to chat with the participant using the same procedure. \\n\\n\\n#### Visit 2 (Feedback Phase) \\n  \\nDuring visit two, participants completed the feedback phase of the task while undergoing an MRI scan. Participants were told they would chat online at the end of the visit with the peer selected for them. The fMRI feedback task included 60 trials. On each trial, for 2\\xa0s, the photograph of each peer for whom participants had previously indicated their interest was displayed, and a reminder appeared about whether participants had judged the peer as one of interest (liked) or not (unliked). An inter-stimulus interval of 2, 4, 6, or 8\\xa0s was included in equal numbers per duration length across the 60 trials (i.e., 15 trials). Next, for 1\\xa0s, participants viewed feedback indicating whether the presented peer wanted to interact with the participants (i.e., acceptance feedback; ‚Äú  He/she LIKED you  ‚Äù), did not want to interact with the participants (i.e., rejection feedback; ‚Äú  He/she DID NOT LIKE you  ‚Äù), or did not rate their interest of the participants (i.e., ‚Äúnot rated‚Äù feedback; ‚Äú  NOT RATED  ‚Äù). We modified a previous version of the chatroom fMRI task ( ,  ) to include a ‚Äúnot rated‚Äù condition to have a neutral comparison event for use in fMRI analyses rather than a general baseline. Feedback types were pseudo-randomized with an equal number of trials (i.e., 15 trials) yielding 6 event types that combine participants‚Äô selections and peer feedback condition (i.e., acceptance/rejection/not rated from liked peers, acceptance/rejection/not rated from unliked peers).

Within each condition, there were 10 targets (i.e.\\xa040 targets for each participant), and we aimed for an equal number of boys and girls within each condition. Due to a data management error,   z  -scores for the targets in two of the six task versions were incorrect and did not fall within the criteria (i.e.   z  -score between\\u2009¬±\\u20091 and 5). Popularity and social preference (i.e. likability) scores were recalculated for the target images in these task versions. For one group of participants (n\\u2009=\\u200920), there were a sufficient number of target images that fit the criteria for each condition (High Popularity\\u2009=\\u20099, Low Popularity\\u2009=\\u20098, High Social Preference\\u2009=\\u20098, Low Social Preference\\u2009=\\u200910), so these participants were included, resulting in five groups of participants and study stimuli. For the other groups, there were an insufficient number of target images (e.g. as little as\\xa05) in the conditions, so these participants (n\\u2009=\\u200915) were excluded. The faces in each condition were equally divided by female and male adolescents. We also attempted to build a racially/ethnically diverse paradigm such that each condition contains some faces representing individuals from minoritized groups. Research suggests that social preference (i.e. likability) and popularity are two distinct but correlated sociometric constructs in adolescents ( ). For our stimuli, the correlation between social preference and popularity scores ranged from 0.36 to 0.68 (Group 1:   r  \\u2009=\\u20090.36,   P  \\u2009<\\u20090.05; Group 2:   r  \\u2009=\\u20090.68,   P  \\u2009<\\u20090.001; Group 3:   r  \\u2009=\\u20090.56,   P  \\u2009<\\u20090.001; Group 4:   r  \\u2009=\\u20090.42,   P  \\u2009<\\u20090.01, Group 5:   r  \\u2009=\\u20090.46,   P  \\u2009<\\u20090.005). The correlation between social preference and popularity scores in the larger dataset from which study stimuli were drawn was 0.46,   P  \\u2009<\\u20090.001. Each target belonged in only one sociometric category and there was no overlap between targets in the social preference and popularity conditions. We did so to maximize the difference between neural responses to sociometric likability and popularity and increase the statistical power in our analyses. No adolescent participants in this neuroimaging study were included as face stimuli. The average   z  -score within each condition was approximately 2 (absolute value; see  ). We ensured equal distributions of sociometric scores across schools and conditions for the stimuli. \\n\\nThe Classmates task consisted of 16 blocks, four blocks per condition, presented across two runs. The blocks were presented in a randomized order. Within each block, there were 10 targets chosen to comprise that condition. Peer faces within each block were shown in a fixed order using a randomization algorithm. Participants saw each face 4 times total (2 in each run), with each condition having 40 total trials each. To achieve the power for neuroimaging analysis on visual stimuli, we repeated each peer face across the conditions, in line with previous studies (e.g.  ;  ). We used a 1-back task to ensure that adolescent participants were paying attention to these visual stimuli during scanning, such that each block contained one target that appeared twice in a row. In addition, implicit inferences of social attributes from faces often require face identity recognition processes ( ,  ). A large body of work has shown that 1-back paradigms successfully elicit face identity recognition processes in which participants invoke a mental representation of face identity in the absence of percept ( ;  ;  ). Participants were instructed to press a button with their right pointer finger when a face repeated. Adolescents were not explicitly told to track peer status, which allows us to investigate how the brain spontaneously supports adolescents‚Äô awareness of peer-based social hierarchies in real-world networks. Each face was shown for 1750\\u2009ms, and a fixation cross was jittered around an average of 2301\\u2009ms (range: 565.8‚Äì4936.8\\u2009ms; see\\xa0 ).

To answer, participants were provided a button box and instructed to navigate left or right on a rotary-dial to the correct digit (between 0 and 9). In addition, a performance bar at the top of the screen continuously displayed the ‚Äòaverage‚Äô performance of previous participants (artificially set to 80%) as well as the participant‚Äôs current performance. Participants were instructed to attain or surpass the average performance of their peers. To induce a high failure rate, the participant‚Äôs response time limit got adjusted throughout the task to enforce a range of approximately 20% to 45% correct responses (Dedovic et al.,  ). Specifically, participants were given 10% less time after three consecutive correct responses and 10% more time after three consecutive incorrect or timeout responses. To further induce psychosocial stress, participants were presented with a 5 sec on screen summary of their current performance and were reminded that their ‚Äòperformance should be close to or better than the average performance‚Äô. This summary was presented at five timepoints during the stress condition. In addition, participants received scripted negative verbal feedback in between runs from a member of the study team saying: ‚ÄòYour performance is below average.

Participants had a maximum of 6\\u2005s to respond with a button response that corresponded to the target position on the screen and were instructed to be as accurate as possible in the time given. The position of the correct target was randomly selected on each retrieval trial. The cue and six targets were presented until a response was made or when the maximum 6\\u2005s limit was reached (M response times  \\u2009¬±\\u2009  SD\\u2009=\\u20092.86\\u2005s\\u2009¬±\\u20090.42\\u2005s).

A 2\\u2009√ó\\u20092 (loop\\u2009√ó\\u2009delay) ANOVA, where the dependent variable was the proportion of missing responses, showed no significant effects (  F  s\\u2009<\\u20090.37). Thus, any differences in dependency across conditions are unlikely to be caused by assuming missing responses would have been incorrect.

If participants stopped the stopwatch within this time window, the trial was deemed a success. In contrast, if participants failed to stop the stopwatch within this time window, the trial was deemed as a failure. To experimentally manipulate the success/failure outcome (without being affected by participants‚Äô performance), participants were shown random numbers on the display of the stopwatch after 3 s; thus, they could not accurately calibrate the correct timing. In some blocks, participants completed the task with a focus on approach goals, where they earned points when they succeeded but did not lose any points when they failed. In other blocks, participants completed the same task with a focus on avoidance goals, where they lost points when they failed but did not earn points when they succeeded. \\n\\nEach block started with a short instruction indicating the type of the upcoming block (approach = ‚ÄúWill win points if you succeed‚Äù; avoidance = ‚ÄúWill lose points if you fail‚Äù). Participants needed to press a button within 5 s to indicate that they understood the nature of the upcoming block; when participants did not press a button within 5 s, they were told that they needed to respond quickly and shown the same instruction again. This block instruction was followed by a jittered ISI (between 3 to 7 s) and experimental trials. Each trial started with a cue for 2 s. The cue indicated one of the three different points (3, 1, and 0). In the approach blocks, participants were told that they would earn the presented amount of points when they were successful in the trial, but they would not lose any points if they failed in the trial. In the avoidance blocks, participants were told that they would lose the presented amount of points when they failed in the trial, but they would not earn any points when they were successful. The cue was followed by a jittered ISI (between 3 to 7 s), which was replaced by a stopwatch that automatically started. Participants needed to press a button to stop the stopwatch within the time frame described earlier. Once participants pressed the button, the stopwatch stopped and participants found out whether they were sucessful or not. The outcome was shown for 3.2 s, followed by a jittered ITI (3‚Äì7 s) and the next trial. When participants failed to press a button within 6 s after the stoptwatch started, they were told to press the button sooner and a new trial started. The three different point conditions were included to increase the unpredictability of the task and thereby encourage participants to pay attention to the cue of each trial. '],\n",
