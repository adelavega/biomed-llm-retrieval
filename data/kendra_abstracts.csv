pmid_8799180,Memory for object features versus memory for object location: a positron-emission tomography study of encoding and retrieval processes.,,"Regional cerebral blood flow was measured with positron-emission tomography during two encoding and two retrieval tasks that were designed to compare memory for object features with memory for object locations. Bilateral increases in regional cerebral blood flow were observed in both anterior and posterior regions of inferior temporal cortex and in ventral regions of prestriate cortex, when the condition that required retrieval of object locations was subtracted from the condition that required retrieval of object features. During encoding, these changes were less pronounced and were restricted to the left inferior temporal cortex and right ventral prestriate cortex. In contrast, both encoding and retrieval of object location were associated with bilateral changes in dorsal prestriate and posterior parietal cortex. Finally, the two encoding conditions activated left frontal lobe regions preferentially, whereas the two retrieval conditions activated right frontal lobe regions. These findings confirm that, in human subjects, memory for object features is mediated by a distributed system that includes ventral prestriate cortex and both anterior and posterior regions of the inferior temporal gyrus. In contrast, memory for the locations of objects appears to be mediated by an anatomically distinct system that includes more dorsal regions of prestriate cortex and posterior regions of the parietal lobe.

pmid_24025064,True or false? Activations of language-related areas in patients with disorders of consciousness.,,"Twenty-nine patients with Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome (UWS), 26 patients in Minimally Conscious State (MCS), and 21 healthy control individuals matched in age and social environment (patients' relatives) were presented with 80 short sentences half of which were factually correct, and the other half factually incorrect. The diagnosis was made on the basis of repeated neurological examinations as well as the standardized assessment using a Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R). fMRI blood oxygen level dependent signal was recorded in an event-related design time-locked to the end word of the sentences. In the contrast ""incorrect-minus-correct"" significant activations in the relevant brain regions were obtained in 17 (81%) controls and in 16 (29%) patients. Among patients, the 16 responders had a significantly longer time since accident than the 39 non-responders. Responders and non-responders did not differ in terms of the diagnosis (UWS vs. MCS), age, CRS-R score, or the degree of brain atrophy. The data concur with the results of several earlier studies on UWS/MCS patients, with the difference that the critical stimuli in those studies were semantically incongruent or ambiguous propositions rather than factually false ones in the present experiment. The hypothesis is discussed that the differential response of brain language areas to factually correct and incorrect statements does not require conscious perception of the statements. ",
pmid_21408105,Effects of unconscious processing on implicit memory for fearful faces.,,"Emotional stimuli can be processed even when participants perceive them without conscious awareness, but the extent to which unconsciously processed emotional stimuli influence implicit memory after short and long delays is not fully understood. We addressed this issue by measuring a subliminal affective priming effect in Experiment 1 and a long-term priming effect in Experiment 2. In Experiment 1, a flashed fearful or neutral face masked by a scrambled face was presented three times, then a target face (either fearful or neutral) was presented and participants were asked to make a fearful/neutral judgment. We found that, relative to a neutral prime face (neutral-fear face), a fearful prime face speeded up participants' reaction to a fearful target (fear-fear face), when they were not aware of the masked prime face. But this response pattern did not apply to the neutral target. In Experiment 2, participants were first presented with a masked faces six times during encoding. Three minutes later, they were asked to make a fearful/neutral judgment for the same face with congruent expression, the same face with incongruent expression or a new face. Participants showed a significant priming effect for the fearful faces but not for the neutral faces, regardless of their awareness of the masked faces during encoding. These results provided evidence that unconsciously processed stimuli could enhance emotional memory after both short and long delays. It indicates that emotion can enhance memory processing whether the stimuli are encoded consciously or unconsciously. ",

placebos","Antidepressant drugs are commonly used to treat fibromyalgia, but there is little knowledge about their mechanisms of action. The aim of this study was to compare the cerebral and behavioral response to positive treatment effects of antidepressants or placebo. Ninety-two fibromyalgia patients participated in a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with milnacipran, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Before and after treatment, measures of cerebral pain processing were obtained using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Also, there were stimulus response assessments of pressure pain, measures of weekly pain, and fibromyalgia impact. Following treatment, milnacipran responders exhibited significantly higher activity in the posterior cingulum compared with placebo responders. The mere exposure to milnacipran did not explain our findings because milnacipran responders exhibited increased activity also in comparison to milnacipran nonresponders. Stimulus response assessments revealed specific antihyperalgesic effects in milnacipran responders, which was also correlated with reduced clinical pain and with increased activation of the posterior cingulum. A short history of pain predicted positive treatment response to milnacipran. We report segregated neural mechanisms for positive responses to treatment with milnacipran and placebo, reflected in the posterior cingulum. The increase of pain-evoked activation in the posterior cingulum may reflect a normalization of altered default mode network processing, an alteration implicated in fibromyalgia pathophysiology. This study presents neural and psychophysical correlates to positive treatment responses in patients with fibromyalgia, treated with either milnacipran or placebo. The comparison between placebo responders and milnacipran responders may shed light on the specific mechanisms involved in antidepressant treatment of chronic pain. ",

schizophrenia","Schizophrenia is characterized by altered resting-state functional connectivity. Most previous studies have focused on changes in connectivity strengths; however, the alterations in connectivity density in schizophrenia remain largely unknown. Here, we aimed to investigate changes in resting-state functional connectivity density (rsFCD) in schizophrenia. A total of 95 schizophrenia patients and 93 sex- and age-matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional MRI examinations. The rsFCD, which reflects the total number of functional connections between a given brain voxel and all other voxels in the entire brain, was calculated for each voxel of each subject. Voxel-based comparisons were performed to identify brain regions with significant rsFCD differences between patients and controls (P < 0.05, corrected). Compared with HCs, patients with schizophrenia showed significantly increased rsFCD in the bilateral striatum and hippocampus and significantly decreased rsFCD in the bilateral sensorimotor cortices and right occipital cortex. However, the rsFCD values of these brain regions were not correlated with antipsychotic dosage, illness duration, or clinical symptom severity. The striatal and hippocampal regions and parietal-occipital regions exhibited completely different changes in rsFCD in schizophrenia, which roughly correspond to dopamine activity in these regions in schizophrenia. These findings support the connectivity disorder hypothesis of schizophrenia and increase our understanding of the neural mechanisms of schizophrenia. ",
pmid_21368084,Sensorimotor functional connectivity changes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,,"We investigated whether the functional connections to the primary sensorimotor cortex (SMC) at rest are abnormal in 26 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and whether such changes are related to the corticospinal tract (CST) damage, measured using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT MRI). ALS patients versus controls showed a significantly increased functional connectivity between the left SMC and the right cingulate cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and cerebellum-crus II. No right SMC connectivity changes were found. The pattern of increased functional connectivity to the left SMC was more widespread when considering only patients with no CST DT MRI abnormalities than the whole group of patients. In this patient group, functional connectivity was also increased between the right SMC and the right parahippocampal gyrus. On the contrary, in ALS patients with CST damage (as assessed using DT MRI) versus controls, functional connectivity was increased between the left SMC and the right cingulate cortex only, while it was decreased between the right SMC and the right cerebellum-lobule VI. In ALS patients, disease severity correlated with reduced SMC functional connectivity. Functional brain changes do occur in ALS with mild disability. These changes might have a role in compensating for (limited) structural damage and might exhaust with increasing burden of disease pathology. ",
pmid_22391134,Trait impulsivity and prefrontal gray matter reductions in cocaine dependent individuals.,,"Impulsivity is thought to play a key role in cocaine addiction onset and progression; therefore, we hypothesized that different facets of impulsive personality may be significantly associated with brain structural abnormalities in cocaine-dependent individuals. Thirty-eight cocaine-dependent individuals and 38 non-drug using controls completed the UPPS-P scale (measuring five different facets of impulsivity: sensation seeking, lack of premeditation, lack of perseverance, and positive and negative urgency) and were scanned on a 3T MRI scanner. We used whole-brain voxel-based morphometry analyses (VBM) to detect differences in gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes between cocaine users and controls, and to measure differences in the way that impulsivity relates to GM and WM volumes in cocaine users vs. controls. Cocaine-dependent individuals had lower GM volumes in a number of sections of the orbitofrontal cortex, right inferior frontal gyrus, right insula, left amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus, temporal gyrus, and bilateral caudate. They also had lower WM volumes in the left inferior and medial frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, right anterior cingulate cortex, insula and caudate. There was a positive correlation between trait impulsivity and GM volume in the left inferior/middle frontal gyrus of cocaine-dependent individuals, a pattern directly opposed to the association in controls. Conversely, in cocaine users lack of premeditation was negatively correlated with GM volume in the insula and the putamen. Trait impulsivity may influence cocaine dependence by impacting its neurobiological underpinnings in frontostriatal systems. ",
pmid_16401465,Novel evidence for hypersensitivity of visceral sensory neural circuitry in irritable bowel syndrome patients.,,"Visceral hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients has been documented by evaluation of perceived stimulations that can reflect abnormalities of both sensory neurocircuitry and cognitive processes. The presence of actual neurohypersensitivity in human beings has not been documented separately. Because subliminal stimulations are free from the influence of stimulus-related cognitive processes, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) cortical response to these stimuli can be considered a measure of activity of the neural circuitry alone. The aim of this study was to compare quantitatively the cerebral cortical fMRI activity response to equal subliminal stimulations between IBS patients and age-matched controls. We studied 10 IBS patients and 10 healthy controls using a computerized barostat-controlled rectal distention device. fMRI activity volume and percent maximum signal intensity change for equal subliminal distention pressures were compared between controls and patients. Three levels of subliminal distention pressures (eg, 10, 15, and 20 mm Hg), were represented in both controls and patients and were analyzed for fMRI response. In all 3 distention levels the fMRI activity volume in IBS patients was significantly larger than age- and sex-matched controls (P < .05). The percent maximum signal intensity change was similar between IBS patients and controls. The volume of cerebral cortical activity response to equal subliminal distention pressures in IBS patients is significantly larger than in controls, documenting the existence of hypersensitivity of the neural circuitry in this patient group irrespective of stimulus-related cognitive processes.

pmid_11897168,Mental navigation in humans is processed in the anterior bank of the parieto-occipital sulcus.,,"We examined the brain regions which were activated during mental navigation; functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 16 right-handed male volunteers. The anterior bank of the parieto-occipital sulcus (APO) was strongly activated in all 16 subjects examined. In group study, the retrosplenial area, the bilateral angular gyrus/occipital cortex junction, the left superior premotor area, the right parahippocampal gyrus, and the right cerebellum were activated commonly across 16 subjects. The APO region activated during mental navigation appeared to be equivalent to the visual area V6A in monkeys and to subserve egocentric spatial processes. ",

Thought-probes","Focused attention meditations have been shown to improve psychological health and wellbeing and are nowadays an integral part of many psychotherapies. While research on the neural correlates of focused attention meditation is increasing, findings vary on whether meditations are associated with high or low activity in the default mode network (DMN). To clarify the relationship between focused attention meditation and the activity in DMN regions, it may be helpful to distinguish internal and external attention as well as different phases within one meditation: During focused attention meditation, the practitioner switches between mindful attention, mind-wandering and refocusing. Here, we employed a thought-probe paradigm to study the neural correlates of these different phases. Twenty healthy, meditation naïve participants were introduced to external (mindfulness of sound) and internal (mindfulness of breathing) attention meditation and then practiced the meditation at home for four consecutive days. They then performed the same focused attention meditations during fMRI scanning, in four runs alternating between internal and external attention. At pseudorandom intervals, participants were asked whether they had just been focused on the task (mindful attention) or had been distracted (mind-wandering). During mindful attention, brain regions typically associated with the DMN, such as the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and left temporoparietal junction showed significantly less neural activation compared to mind-wandering phases. Reduced activity of the DMN was found during both external and internal attention, with stronger deactivation in the posterior cingulate cortex during internal attention compared to external attention. Moreover, refocusing after mind-wandering was associated with activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus. Our results support the theory that mindful attention is associated with reduced DMN activity compared to mind-wandering, independent of the practitioner's attention focus (i.e., internal vs. external).

neurodegeneration","Affective dysfunctions are common in patients with Parkinson's disease, but the underlying neurobiological deviations have rarely been examined. Parkinson's disease is characterized by a loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra resulting in impairment of motor and non-motor basal ganglia-cortical loops. Concerning emotional deficits, some studies provide evidence for altered brain processing in limbic- and lateral-orbitofrontal gating loops. In a second line of evidence, human premotor and inferior parietal homologs of mirror neuron areas were involved in processing and understanding of emotional facial expressions. We examined deviations in brain activation during processing of facial expressions in patients and related these to emotion recognition accuracy. 13 patients and 13 healthy controls underwent an emotion recognition task and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurement. In the Emotion Hexagon test, participants were presented with blends of two emotions and had to indicate which emotion best described the presented picture. Blended pictures with three levels of difficulty were included. During fMRI scanning, participants observed video clips depicting emotional, non-emotional, and neutral facial expressions or were asked to produce these facial expressions themselves. Patients performed slightly worse in the emotion recognition task, but only when judging the most ambiguous facial expressions. Both groups activated inferior frontal and anterior inferior parietal homologs of mirror neuron areas during observation and execution of the emotional facial expressions. During observation, responses in the pars opercularis of the right inferior frontal gyrus, in the bilateral inferior parietal lobule and in the bilateral supplementary motor cortex were decreased in patients. Furthermore, in patients, activation of the right anterior inferior parietal lobule was positively related to accuracy in the emotion recognition task. Our data provide evidence for a contribution of human homologs of monkey mirror areas to the emotion recognition deficit in Parkinson's disease. ",
pmid_18579575,Abnormal temporal difference reward-learning signals in major depression.,,"Anhedonia is a core symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD), long thought to be associated with reduced dopaminergic function. However, most antidepressants do not act directly on the dopamine system and all antidepressants have a delayed full therapeutic effect. Recently, it has been proposed that antidepressants fail to alter dopamine function in antidepressant unresponsive MDD. There is compelling evidence that dopamine neurons code a specific phasic (short duration) reward-learning signal, described by temporal difference (TD) theory. There is no current evidence for other neurons coding a TD reward-learning signal, although such evidence may be found in time. The neuronal substrates of the TD signal were not explored in this study. Phasic signals are believed to have quite different properties to tonic (long duration) signals. No studies have investigated phasic reward-learning signals in MDD. Therefore, adults with MDD receiving long-term antidepressant medication, and comparison controls both unmedicated and acutely medicated with the antidepressant citalopram, were scanned using fMRI during a reward-learning task. Three hypotheses were tested: first, patients with MDD have blunted TD reward-learning signals; second, controls given an antidepressant acutely have blunted TD reward-learning signals; third, the extent of alteration in TD signals in major depression correlates with illness severity ratings. The results supported the hypotheses. Patients with MDD had significantly reduced reward-learning signals in many non-brainstem regions: ventral striatum (VS), rostral and dorsal anterior cingulate, retrosplenial cortex (RC), midbrain and hippocampus. However, the TD signal was increased in the brainstem of patients. As predicted, acute antidepressant administration to controls was associated with a blunted TD signal, and the brainstem TD signal was not increased by acute citalopram administration. In a number of regions, the magnitude of the abnormal signals in MDD correlated with illness severity ratings. The findings highlight the importance of phasic reward-learning signals, and are consistent with the hypothesis that antidepressants fail to normalize reward-learning function in antidepressant-unresponsive MDD. Whilst there is evidence that some antidepressants acutely suppress dopamine function, the long-term action of virtually all antidepressants is enhanced dopamine agonist responsiveness. This distinction might help to elucidate the delayed action of antidepressants. Finally, analogous to recent work in schizophrenia, the finding of abnormal phasic reward-learning signals in MDD implies that an integrated understanding of symptoms and treatment mechanisms is possible, spanning physiology, phenomenology and pharmacology.

A total of 24 patients and 27 healthy subjects were included. The patients underwent neuropsychological tests and took twice resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) (before and after HD). Healthy group had one rs-fMRI. The zALFF based on rs-fMRI was calculated. Paired t and independent t test was applied to compare zALFF among groups. The associations between zALFF and duration of HD, ultrafiltration volume, and neuropsychological tests was calculated by partial correlation. Compared to healthy group, patients before HD showed significant worse performances on digit symbol test (DST) and serial dotting test (SDT). Patients after HD performed DST better than before HD. The patients after HD showed higher zALFF in left putamen than before HD. Multiple regions of both HD groups showed significant lower zALFF than healthy group. The zALFF of left putamen of patients after HD was significant negative correlated with the ultrafiltration volume (R = -0.679). The zALFF in patients before HD exhibited significantly positive or negative correlations with DST and SDT in multiple regions. The zALFF of patients after HD significantly negative correlated with DST in right temporal, positive and negative correlated with ultrafiltration volume in right frontal, left putamen respectively. ESRD patients showed changed spontaneous brain activity and cognitive impairments. After a single HD session, patients performed better in neuropsychological test, and spontaneous brain activity changed in left putamen. Ultrafiltration volume might be associated with activity of left putamen. ",

A rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was established. EA at LI11 and ST36 was started at 24 h (MCAO + EA group) after ischemic stroke modeling. Untreated model (MCAO) and sham-operated (Sham) groups were included as controls. The neurological deficits of all groups were assessed using modified neurologic severity scores (mNSS) at 24 h and 14 days after MCAO. To further investigate the effect of EA on infarct volume and brain function, functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to estimate the size of the brain lesions and neural activities of each group at 14 days after ischemic stroke. EA treatment of MCAO rats led to a significant reduction in the infarct volumes accompanied by functional recovery, reflected in improved mNSS outcomes and motor functional performances. Furthermore, functional connectivity between the left motor cortex and left cerebellum posterior lobe, right motor cortex, left striatum and bilateral sensory cortex were decreased in MCAO group but increased after EA treatment. EA at LI11 and ST36 could enhance the functional connectivity between the left motor cortex and the motor function-related brain regions, including the motor cortex, sensory cortex and striatum, in rats. EA exhibits potential as a treatment for ischemic stroke. ",

rs1789891","Alcohol metabolizing enzymes, such as the alcohol dehydrogenases and the aldehyde dehydrogenases, regulate the levels of acetaldehyde in the blood and play an important role in the development and maintenance of alcohol addiction. Recent genome-wide systematic searches found associations between a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs1789891, risk allele: A, protective allele: C) in the alcohol dehydrogenase gene cluster and the risk of alcohol dependence. The current study investigated the effect of this single nucleotide polymorphism on alcohol consumption, craving for alcohol, relapse risk and brain gray matter volume. Alcohol-dependent patients (n = 74) and controls (n = 43) were screened, genotyped and underwent magnetic resonance imaging scanning, and relapse data were collected during 3 months following the experiment. Alcohol-dependent A allele carriers reported increased alcohol craving and higher alcohol consumption compared with the group of alcohol-dependent individuals homozygous for the C allele, which displayed craving values similar to the control group. Further, follow-up data indicated that A allele carriers relapsed earlier to heavy drinking compared with individuals with two C alleles. Analyses of gray matter volume indicated a significant genotype difference in the patient group: individuals with two C alleles had reduced gray matter volume in the left and right superior, middle and inferior temporal gyri. Findings of the current study further support the relevance of genetic variants in alcohol metabolizing enzymes to addictive behavior, brain tissue volume and relapse risk. Genotype-dependent differences in acetaldehyde formation, implicated by earlier studies, might be the biological substrate of the genotype differences. ",

Here, we used human functional MRI to measure brain activity during improvisation in a sample of 39 professional pianists with varying backgrounds in classical and jazz piano playing. We found total hours of improvisation experience to be negatively associated with activity in frontoparietal executive cortical areas. In contrast, improvisation training was positively associated with functional connectivity of the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, dorsal premotor cortices, and presupplementary areas. The effects were significant when controlling for hours of classical piano practice and age. These results indicate that even neural mechanisms involved in creative behaviors, which require a flexible online generation of novel and meaningful output, can be automated by training. Second, improvisational musical training can influence functional brain properties at a network level. We show that the greater functional connectivity seen in experienced improvisers may reflect a more efficient exchange of information within associative networks of importance for musical creativity.

Compared with the healthy controls (N=36, 22.2 ± 3.13 years), IGA participants (N=35, 22.28 ± 2.54 years) showed significant lower gray matter density in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, left cingulate gyrus, insula, right precuneus, and right hippocampus (all p<0.05). IGA participants also showed significant lower white matter density in the inferior frontal gyrus, insula, amygdala, and anterior cingulate than healthy controls (all p<0.05). Previous studies suggest that these brain regions are involved in decision-making, behavioral inhibition and emotional regulation. Current findings might provide insight in understanding the biological underpinnings of IGA. ",
pmid_17385077,Altered cortical activation during a motor task in ALS. Evidence for involvement of central pathways.,,"To test the hypothesis that patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) show increased cortical activation during a motor task compared to both healthy controls and patients with muscle weakness due to peripheral lesions. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to measure activation during a block design paradigm contrasting right hand movements against rest in sixteen patients with ALS, seventeen healthy controls and nine patients with peripheral lesions. The groups were matched for age and gender and the two patient groups were matched for their degree of upper limb weakness. Analysis used a non-parametric approach to perform a 3 way hypothesis-driven comparison between the groups. During the motor task, patients with ALS showed increased cortical activation bilaterally, extending from the sensorimotor cortex [Brodmann areas (BA) 1, 2, 4] posteriorly into the inferior parietal lobule (BA 40) and inferiorly to the superior temporal gyrus (BA 22) when compared to peripheral lesion patients and controls. In addition, ALS patients showed reduced activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) extending to anterior and medial frontal cortex (BA 8, 9, 10, 32). We conclude that alterations in cortical function in ALS differ in sensorimotor and prefrontal regions. Importantly, we have shown that these changes do not reflect confounding by weakness or task difficulty, but are likely to be related to upper motor neuron pathology in ALS. ",
pmid_20053347,Neural correlates of generating visual nouns and motor verbs in a minimal phrase context.,,"The neural basis underlying the generation of nouns and verbs is still not completely understood. In classical generation tasks, specific features of the produced words can hardly be controlled. Therefore, the observed neural correlates of noun and verb production cannot be directly related to differences in specific features of the generated words. The present study seeks to address this issue by using a ""minimal-phrase context"" to elicit the activation of specific nouns and verbs. With this context, the to-be-generated words were highly constrained, and thus their semantic and other features (visual/action relatedness, word frequency, cloze probability, etc.) are well controlled. Thus, the present paradigm combines the advantages of classical word generation tasks (i.e., active semantic processing) with the advantages of tasks that allow for a high control of the experimental stimuli, such as passive viewing, reading, or lexical decision tasks. In an fMRI study, 17 participants generated verbs with strong motor and nouns with strong visual associations. Both noun and verb generation, compared to a rhyme generation baseline, elicited stronger activation in perisylvian language areas of the temporal and parietal cortex. In addition, stronger activation for nouns was found in the right middle/inferior temporal cortex. This activation supports the claim that noun generation is mediated by visual processing areas. Stronger activation for verb generation was found in the left superior temporal gyrus. Since this area is involved in motion perception, the results suggest that perceptual representations of movements mediate the generation of action verbs. ",

Taste and reward processing
Visual food cues
Visual perspective","Every day, people are exposed to images of appetizing foods that can lead to high-calorie intake and contribute to overweight and obesity. Research has documented that manipulating the visual perspective from which eating is viewed helps resist temptation by altering the appraisal of unhealthy foods. However, the neural basis of this effect has not yet been examined using neuroimaging methods. Moreover, it is not known whether the benefits of this strategy can be observed when people, especially overweight, are not explicitly asked to imagine themselves eating. Last, it remains to be investigated if visual perspective could be used to promote healthy foods. The present work manipulated camera angles and tested whether visual perspective modulates activity in brain regions associated with taste and reward processing while participants watch videos featuring a hand grasping (unhealthy or healthy) foods from a plate during functional magnetic resonance imagining (fMRI). The plate was filmed from the perspective of the participant (first-person perspective; 1PP), or from a frontal view as if watching someone else eating (third-person perspective; 3PP). Our findings reveal that merely viewing unhealthy food cues from a 1PP (vs. 3PP) increases activity in brain regions that underlie representations of rewarding (appetitive) experiences (amygdala) and food intake (superior parietal gyrus). Additionally, our results show that ventral striatal activity is positively correlated with body mass index (BMI) during exposure to unhealthy foods from a 1PP (vs. 3PP). These findings suggest that unhealthy foods should be promoted through third-person (video) images to weaken the reward associated with their simulated consumption, especially amongst overweight people. It appears however that, as such, manipulating visual perspective fails to enhance the perception of healthy foods. Their promotion thus requires complementary solutions. ",
pmid_23867077,When less is more: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study of verbal working memory in remitted depressed patients.,,"Patients with depression show abnormalities in the neural circuitry supporting working memory. However, it is unclear if these abnormalities are present in unmedicated remitted depressed patients. To address this question, the current study employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in combination with a simple verbal n-back task, in a cohort of unmedicated remitted depressed patients. We studied 15 healthy control subjects (HC) and 15 unmedicated remitted depressed patients (rMDD). Participants performed a verbal working memory task of varying cognitive load (n-back) while undergoing fMRI. We used multiple regression analyses to assess overall capacity (1-, 2-, 3-back versus 0-back) as well as quadratic modulation of cognitive demand. Performance accuracy and response latency did not differ between groups, and overall capacity was similar. However, rMDD showed a positive quadratic load response in the bilateral hippocampus; the converse was true for HC. Our data suggest that remitted depression was associated with a perturbed pattern of activation in the bilateral hippocampus during a verbal working memory task. We propose that a reduced ability to dampen task-irrelevant activity may reflect a neurobiological risk factor for recurrent depression. ",
pmid_11501736,The role of spatial configuration in tests of working memory explored with functional neuroimaging.,,"While the importance of the prefrontal cortex for ""higher-order"" cognitive functions is largely undisputed, no consensus has been reached regarding the fractionation of functions within this region. Several recent functional neuroimaging studies have suggested that the mid-ventrolateral frontal cortex may play an important role in various aspects of human memory. Thus, similar patterns of activation have been observed in this region during analogous spatial, verbal and visual span tasks. In the present study, however, activation was observed in a more dorsolateral region of the lateral frontal cortex during a modified version of the spatial span task, which differed only in the spatial configuration of the array employed. The results of a supplementary behavioral study, designed to investigate this effect further, suggest that in spatial memory tasks certain stimulus configurations may encourage subjects to adopt mnemonic strategies, which may depend upon dorsolateral, rather than ventrolateral, regions of the frontal cortex. These findings shed further light on the functional relationship between dorsal and ventral regions of the lateral frontal cortex and, more specifically, how the ""executive"" processes assumed to be dependent upon these regions might contribute to aspects of human memory.

In adults, long-term cannabis use is associated with disturbances in frontostriatal circuits during tasks that require the engagement of self-regulatory control, including the resolution of cognitive conflict. Understudied are the behavioral and neural correlates of these processes earlier in the course of cannabis use disentangled from effects of long-term use. The present study investigated the functioning of frontostriatal circuits during the resolution of cognitive conflict in cannabis-using youth. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired from 28 cannabis-using youth and 32 age-matched healthy participants during the performance of a Simon task. General linear modeling was used to compare patterns of brain activation during correct responses to conflict stimuli across groups. Psychophysiologic interaction analyses were used to examine conflict-related frontostriatal connectivity across groups. Associations of frontostriatal activation and connectivity with cannabis use measures were explored. Decreased conflict-related activity was detected in cannabis-using versus healthy control youth in frontostriatal regions, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, striatum, pallidum, and thalamus. Frontostriatal connectivity did not differ across groups, but negative connectivity between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and striatum was detected in the 2 groups. These findings are consistent with previous reports of cannabis-associated disturbances in frontostriatal circuits in adults and point to the specific influence of cannabis on neurodevelopmental changes in youth. Future studies should examine whether frontostriatal functioning is a reliable marker of cannabis use disorder severity and a potential target for circuit-based interventions. ",
pmid_15893942,fMRI-acoustic noise alters brain activation during working memory tasks.,,"Scanner noise during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may interfere with brain function and change blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals, a problem that generally worsens at the higher field strengths. Therefore, we studied the effect of increased acoustic noise on fMRI during verbal working memory (WM) processing. The sound pressure level of scanner noise was increased by 12 dBA from ""Quiet"" to ""Loud"" echo planar imaging (EPI) scans by utilizing resonant vibration modes of the gradient coil. A WM paradigm with graded levels of task difficulty was used to further access WM load. Increased scanner noise produced increased BOLD responses (percent signal change) bilaterally in the cerebellum, inferior (IFG), medial (medFG), and superior (SFG) frontal, fusiform (FusG), and the lingual (LG) gyri, and decreased BOLD responses bilaterally in the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG) and the putamen. This finding suggests greater recruitment of attention resources in these brain regions, probably to compensate for interference due to louder scanner noise. Increased working memory load increased the BOLD signals in IFG and the cerebellum, but decreased the BOLD signals in the putamen and the LG. These findings also support the idea that brain function requires additional attention resources under noisier conditions. Load- and acoustic-noise-related changes in BOLD responses correlated negatively in the WM network. This study demonstrates that MR noise affects brain activation pattern. Future comparisons between studies performed under different acoustic conditions (due to differing magnetic field strengths, pulse sequences, or scanner manufacturers) might require knowledge of the sound pressure level of acoustic noise during fMRI.

pmid_1729691,Magnetic resonance imaging of perfusion using spin inversion of arterial water.,,"A technique has been developed for proton magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of perfusion, using water as a freely diffusable tracer, and its application to the measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the rat is demonstrated. The method involves labeling the inflowing water proton spins in the arterial blood by inverting them continuously at the neck region and observing the effects of inversion on the intensity of brain MRI. Solution to the Bloch equations, modified to include the effects of flow, allows regional perfusion rates to be measured from an image with spin inversion, a control image, and a T1 image. Continuous spin inversion labeling the arterial blood water was accomplished, using principles of adiabatic fast passage by applying continuous-wave radiofrequency power in the presence of a magnetic field gradient in the direction of arterial flow. In the detection slice used to measure perfusion, whole brain CBF averaged 1.39 +/- 0.19 ml.g-1.min-1 (mean +/- SEM, n = 5). The technique's sensitivity to changes in CBF was measured by using graded hypercarbia, a condition that is known to increase brain perfusion. CBF vs. pCO2 data yield a best-fit straight line described by CBF (ml.g-1.min-1) = 0.052pCO2 (mm Hg) - 0.173, in excellent agreement with values in the literature. Finally, perfusion images of a freeze-injured rat brain have been obtained, demonstrating the technique's ability to detect regional abnormalities in perfusion. ",

fMRI","Theoretical and neurophysiological investigations into compassion are burgeoning, yet the putative neural mechanisms which underpin such processes are less well understood. Therefore, we have conducted an Activation-Likelihood Estimate meta-analysis in order to ascertain the shared neural processes consistently identified as relevant to compassion. Our analysis of sixteen fMRI studies revealed activation across seven broad regions, with the largest peaks localized to the Periaqueductal Grey, Anterior Insula, Anterior Cingulate, and Inferior Frontal Gyrus. Overall, we identified a tendency for studies to operationalize compassion in one of three ways, as driven either 'top-down', 'bottom-up', or modified by target context. We failed to identify regions purportedly common to compassion such as the DLPFC, OFC, and Amygdala, possibly due to a small number of studies which used Loving-Kindness meditation. We argue future research in compassion science continue a multi-modal approach to examine links between neural activity and actual prosocial behavior, and recommend the application of fMRI paradigms on compassion with clinically diagnosed populations to parallel current trends in psychotherapy such as Compassion Focused Therapy.

pmid_19446640,Children with dyslexia lack multiple specializations along the visual word-form (VWF) system.,,"Developmental dyslexia has been associated with a dysfunction of a brain region in the left inferior occipitotemporal cortex, called the ""visual word-form area"" (VWFA). In adult normal readers, the VWFA is specialized for print processing and sensitive to the orthographic familiarity of letter strings. However, it is still unclear whether these two levels of occipitotemporal specialization are affected in developmental dyslexia. Specifically, we investigated whether (a) these two levels of specialization are impaired in dyslexic children with only a few years of reading experience and (b) whether this impairment is confined to the left inferior occipitotemporal VWFA, or extends to adjacent regions of the ""VWF-system"" with its posterior-anterior gradient of print specialization. Using fMRI, we measured brain activity in 18 dyslexic and 24 age-matched control children (age 9.7-12.5 years) while they indicated if visual stimuli (real words, pseudohomophones, pseudowords and false-fonts) sounded like a real word. Five adjacent regions of interest (ROIs) in the bilateral occipitotemporal cortex covered the full anterior-posterior extent of the VWF-system. We found that control and dyslexic children activated the same main areas within the reading network. However, a gradient of print specificity (higher anterior activity to letter strings but higher posterior activity to false-fonts) as well as a constant sensitivity to orthographic familiarity (higher activity for unfamiliar than familiar word-forms) along the VWF-system could only be detected in controls. In conclusion, analyzing responses and specialization profiles along the left VWF-system reveals that children with dyslexia show impaired specialization for both print and orthography. ",

Major depressive disorder
Multivariate pattern analysis","Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the neuroanatomical basis of response to ECT is still largely unknown. In present study, we used functional connectivity density (FCD) and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) to identify the relationship between the changes of resting-state activities and ECT responses in 23 MDD patients before and after ECT. In addition, the identified neural indices as classification characteristics were entered into multivariate pattern analysis using linear support vector machine (SVM) to classify 23 MDD patients before ECT from 25 gender, age and years of education matched healthy controls. We found that the changes of local FCD (lFCD), not long-range FCD, of the left pre-/postcentral gyrus (Pre-/postCG), left superior temporal gyrus (STG), and right STG were significantly correlated with the changes of Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) scores in MDD patients before and after ECT. The subsequent functional connectivity analysis revealed significantly decreased functional connectivity between right STG and right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) in MDD after ECT in spite of no correlation with HRSD scores. Finally, SVM-based classification achieved an accuracy of 72.92% with a sensitivity of 73.91% and a specificity of 72% by leave-one-out cross-validation. Our findings indicated that Pre-/postCG and bilateral STG play an important role in response of ECT in MDD patients, and the lFCD in these areas may serve as a biomarker for predicting ECT response.

pmid_17893237,Spatial and temporal episodic memory retrieval recruit dissociable functional networks in the human brain.,,"Imaging, electrophysiological studies, and lesion work have shown that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is important for episodic memory; however, it is unclear whether different MTL regions support the spatial, temporal, and item elements of episodic memory. In this study we used fMRI to examine retrieval performance emphasizing different aspects of episodic memory in the context of a spatial navigation paradigm. Subjects played a taxi-driver game (""yellowcab""), in which they freely searched for passengers and delivered them to specific landmark stores. Subjects then underwent fMRI scanning as they retrieved landmarks, spatial, and temporal associations from their navigational experience in three separate runs. Consistent with previous findings on item memory, perirhinal cortex activated most strongly during landmark retrieval compared with spatial or temporal source information retrieval. Both hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex activated significantly during retrieval of landmarks, spatial associations, and temporal order. We found, however, a significant dissociation between hippocampal and parahippocampal cortex activations, with spatial retrieval leading to greater parahippocampal activation compared with hippocampus and temporal order retrieval leading to greater hippocampal activation compared with parahippocampal cortex. Our results, coupled with previous findings, demonstrate that the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex are preferentially recruited during temporal order and spatial association retrieval--key components of episodic ""source"" memory.

pmid_29225356,Quantitative neurobiological evidence for accelerated brain aging in alcohol dependence.,,"The premature aging hypothesis of alcohol dependence proposes that the neurobiological and behavioural deficits in individuals with alcohol dependence are analogous to those of chronological aging. However, to date no systematic neurobiological evidence for this hypothesis has been provided. To test the hypothesis, 119 alcohol-dependent subjects and 97 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects underwent structural MRI. Whole-brain grey matter volume maps were computed from structural MRI scans using voxel-based morphometry and parcelled into a comprehensive set of anatomical brain regions. Regional grey matter volume averages served as the basis for cross-regional similarity analyses and a brain age model. We found a striking correspondence between regional patterns of alcohol- and age-related grey matter loss across 110 brain regions. The brain age model revealed that the brain age of age-matched AD subjects was increased by up to 11.7 years. Interestingly, while no brain aging was detected in the youngest AD subjects (20-30 years), we found that alcohol-related brain aging systematically increased in the following age decades controlling for lifetime alcohol consumption and general health status. Together, these results provide strong evidence for an accelerated aging model of AD and indicate an elevated risk of alcohol-related brain aging in elderly individuals. ",

Developmental coordination disorder
Functional magnetic resonance imaging
Motor inhibition","Motor impairment is associated with developmental coordination disorder (DCD), and to a lesser extent with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Previous functional imaging studies investigated children with DCD or ADHD only; however, these two disorders co-occur in up to 50% of cases, suggesting that similar neural correlates are associated with these disorders. This study compared functional brain activation in children and adolescents (age range 8-17, M = 11.73, SD = 2.88) with DCD (n = 9), ADHD (n = 20), co-occurring DCD and ADHD (n = 18) and typically developing (TD) controls (n = 20). When compared to TD controls, children with co-occurring DCD/ADHD showed decreased activation during response inhibition in primary motor and sensory cortices. These findings suggest that children with co-occurring DCD and ADHD display significant functional changes in brain activation that could interfere with inhibition of erroneous motor responses. In contrast to previous studies, significant alterations in brain activation relative to TD controls, were not found in children with isolated DCD or ADHD. These findings highlight the importance of considering co-occurring disorders when investigating brain function in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. ",

Vision","Predictions of upcoming movements are based on several types of neural signals that span the visual, somatosensory, motor and cognitive system. Thus far, pre-movement signals have been investigated while participants viewed the object to be acted upon. Here, we studied the contribution of information other than vision to the classification of preparatory signals for action, even in the absence of online visual information. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to test whether the neural signals evoked by visual, memory-based and somato-motor information can be reliably used to predict upcoming actions in areas of the dorsal and ventral visual stream during the preparatory phase preceding the action, while participants were lying still. Nineteen human participants (nine women) performed one of two actions towards an object with their eyes open or closed. Despite the well-known role of ventral stream areas in visual recognition tasks and the specialization of dorsal stream areas in somato-motor processes, we decoded action intention in areas of both streams based on visual, memory-based and somato-motor signals. Interestingly, we could reliably decode action intention in absence of visual information based on neural activity evoked when visual information was available and vice versa. Our results show a similar visual, memory and somato-motor representation of action planning in dorsal and ventral visual stream areas that allows predicting action intention across domains, regardless of the availability of visual information.

Fifty-six eligible MWoA patients and 32 matched healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study. MWoA patients were divided into three groups according to the headache days per month within 3 months: infrequent episodic migraine (IEM) group, frequent episodic migraine (FEM) group, and chronic migraine (CM) group. Data collection and rest-state fMRI examination were performed in all cases. The ReHo method was used to analyze the blood oxygen level dependent (BLOD) signals of the adjacent voxels in the brain regions of each patient, and the consistency of their fluctuations in the sequences of same time. Compared with normal controls, ReHo values of bilateral thalami, right insula and right middle temporal gyrus increased and both precentral gyri decreased in the IEM group; ReHo values of bilateral thalami and the right middle temporal gyrus increased; ReHo values of both anterior cingulate cortex, precentral gyri and putamen decreased in the FEM group. Compared with control group, ReHo values of left olfactory cortex, right hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, suboccipital gyrus and precuneus increased, both precentral gyri, precuneus, putamen and anterior cingulate cortex decreased in the CM group. Compared with IEM group, ReHo values of both putamen, left middle frontal gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus increased, and the left precuneus decreased in the FEM group. Compared with FEM group, ReHo values of left olfactory and left precuneus increased, and the right superior frontal gyrus, insula, middle temporal gyrus, thalami, both superior temporal gyri decreased in the CM group. In the IEM group, the changes of function focus on the regions associated with coding, conduction and regulation of pain signals. In the FEM group, functional alterations mainly concentrated on the regions associated with pain regulation and emotion cognition. In the CM group, the changes focus on the regions related to spatial attention and cognition, affective disorders and pain feedback, which may be associated with migraine production, development and chronification.

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired in 27 MCI subjects, 35 AD patients, and 27 age- and gender-matched subjects with normal cognition (NC). Interregional functional connectivity was assessed based on a predefined template which parcellated the brain into 90 regions. Altered whole-brain functional connectivity patterns were identified via connectivity comparisons between the AD and NC subjects. Finally, the relationship between functional connectivity strength and cognitive ability according to the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) was evaluated in the MCI and AD groups. Compared with the NC group, the AD group exhibited decreased functional connectivities throughout the brain. The most significantly affected regions included several important nodes of the default mode network and the temporal lobe. Moreover, changes in functional connectivity strength exhibited significant associations with disease severity-related alterations in the AD and MCI groups. The present study provides novel evidence and will facilitate meta-analysis of whole-brain analyses in AD and MCI, which will be critical to better understand the neural basis of AD. ",
pmid_22674280,Dissociable influences of opiates and expectations on pain.,,"Placebo treatments and opiate drugs are thought to have common effects on the opioid system and pain-related brain processes. This has created excitement about the potential for expectations to modulate drug effects themselves. If drug effects differ as a function of belief, this would challenge the assumptions underlying the standard clinical trial. We conducted two studies to directly examine the relationship between expectations and opioid analgesia. We administered the opioid agonist remifentanil to human subjects during experimental thermal pain and manipulated participants' knowledge of drug delivery using an open-hidden design. This allowed us to test drug effects, expectancy (knowledge) effects, and their interactions on pain reports and pain-related responses in the brain. Remifentanil and expectancy both reduced pain, but drug effects on pain reports and fMRI activity did not interact with expectancy. Regions associated with pain processing showed drug-induced modulation during both Open and Hidden conditions, with no differences in drug effects as a function of expectation. Instead, expectancy modulated activity in frontal cortex, with a separable time course from drug effects. These findings reveal that opiates and placebo treatments both influence clinically relevant outcomes and operate without mutual interference. ",

Past imaging and lesion experiments have indicated that the anterior temporal lobes (ATLs) as having a special role in the processing of UEs. It has remained unclear which attributes of UEs were responsible for the observed effects in imaging experiments. In this study, we investigated what factors of UEs influence brain activity. In a training paradigm, we systematically varied the uniqueness of semantic associations, the presence/absence of a proper name, and the number of semantic associations to determine factors modulating activity in regions subserving the processing of UEs. We found that a conjunction of unique semantic information and proper names modulated activity within a section of the left ATL. Overall, the processing of UEs involved a wider left-hemispheric cortical network. Within these regions, brain activity was significantly affected by the unique semantic attributes especially in the presence of a proper name, but we could not find evidence for an effect of the number of semantic associations. Findings are discussed in regard to current models of ATL function, the neurophysiology of semantics, and social cognitive processing. ",
pmid_17920024,The neural signature of social norm compliance.,,"All known human societies establish social order by punishing violators of social norms. However, little is known about how the brain processes the punishment threat associated with norm violations. We use fMRI to study the neural circuitry behind social norm compliance by comparing a treatment in which norm violations can be punished with a control treatment in which punishment is impossible. Individuals' increase in norm compliance when punishment is possible exhibits a strong positive correlation with activations in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Moreover, lateral orbitofrontal cortex activity is strongly correlated with Machiavellian personality characteristics. These findings indicate a neural network involved in social norm compliance that might constitute an important basis for human sociality. Different activations of this network reveal individual differences in the behavioral response to the punishment threat and might thus provide a deeper understanding of the neurobiological sources of pathologies such as antisocial personality disorder.

pmid_30046095,Preferences and beliefs about financial risk taking mediate the association between anterior insula activation and self-reported real-life stock trading.,,"People differ greatly in their financial risk taking behaviour. This heterogeneity has been associated with differences in brain activity, but only in laboratory settings using constrained behaviours. However, it is important to understand how these measures transfer to real life conditions, because the willingness to invest in riskier assets has a direct and considerable effect on long-term wealth accumulation. In a large fMRI study of 157 working age men (39.0 ± 6.4 SD years), we first show that activity in the anterior insula during the assessment of risky vs. safe choices in an investing task is associated with self-reported real-life active stock trading. We then show that this association remains intact when we control for financial constraints, education, the understanding of financial matters, and cognitive abilities. Finally, we use comprehensive measures of preferences and beliefs about risk taking to show that these two channels mediate the association between brain activation in the anterior insula and real-life active stock trading.

Regional homogeneity","Structural and functional deficits associated with schizophrenia are observed prior to the onset of psychosis and differ according to the stage of illness. However, most previous studies concentrated on a limited period during the illness, and it remains uncertain how these abnormalities develop throughout the entire disease course. In the current study, we investigated the gray matter (GM) and regional neural activity alterations in subjects at 4 different stages of schizophrenia. The subjects comprised 53 genetic high risk (HR) individuals, 26 ultra-high risk (UHR) individuals, 58 patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FES), 41 patients with chronic schizophrenia (ChSz) and 39 healthy controls (HC), all of whom underwent structural and resting-state functional MRI scanning. Gray matter volume (GMV), amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) values were compared voxelwise among the five groups using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and the software REST. Correlations among structural, functional abnormalities and PANSS scores in the FES group were evaluated by partial correlation analysis and multiple stepwise regression. Pronounced GMV decline was observed in the bilateral occipital lobe, left orbital frontal cortex, bilateral superior parietal lobule (SPL), right middle temporal gyrus (MTG), gyrus rectus and medial superior frontal gyrus (SFG) in the FES group and in the bilateral occipital lobe in the HR group. The FES patients also showed increased ALFF in the caudate and decreased ReHo in the bilateral inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and precuneus. The ChSz patients displayed increased ALFF in the right hippocampus. The GMV of the right MTG and SPL and the ReHo of the precuneus were negatively correlated with the general psychopathology scale, while the GMV of the right MTG was negatively correlated with the total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The GMV of the right occipital cortex and SPL were associated with the ALFF of the caudate, the GMV of the right SPL was associated with the ReHo of the bilateral IPL and precuneus. GM deficits and regional dysfunction are evident prior to the onset of psychotic symptoms and are more prominent during the onset of illness than during any other phase. The right MTG and SPL, the striatum and the DMN may play important roles in the pathological changes underlying schizophrenia. ",

Twenty-two participants (11 nonpathological; 11 pathological) completed the study by rating the closeness of various outcomes of slot machine displays (wins, losses, and near-misses) to a win. No behavioral differences were observed between groups of participants, however, differences in brain activity were found in the left midbrain, near the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area (SN / VTA). Near-miss outcomes uniquely activated brain regions associated with wins for the pathological gamblers and regions associated with losses for the nonpathological gamblers. Thus, near-miss outcomes on slot machines may contain both functional and neurological properties of wins for pathological gamblers. Such a translational approach to the study of gambling behavior may be considered an example that gives life to B. F. Skinner's conceptualization of the physiologist of the future. ",

Top-down inhibitory control","Two aspects of the EEG literature lead us to revisit mu suppression in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). First and despite the fact that the mu rhythm can be functionally segregated in two discrete sub-bands, 8-10 Hz and 10-12/13 Hz, mu-suppression in ASD has been analyzed as a homogeneous phenomenon covering the 8-13 Hz frequency. Second and although alpha-like activity is usually found across the entire scalp, ASD studies of action observation have focused on the central electrodes (C3/C4). The present study was aimed at testing on the whole brain the hypothesis of a functional dissociation of mu and alpha responses to the observation of human actions in ASD according to bandwidths. Electroencephalographic (EEG) mu and alpha responses to execution and observation of hand gestures were recorded on the whole scalp in high functioning subjects with ASD and typical subjects. When two bandwidths of the alpha-mu 8-13 Hz were distinguished, a different mu response to observation appeared for subjects with ASD in the upper sub-band over the sensorimotor cortex, whilst the lower sub-band responded similarly in the two groups. Source reconstructions demonstrated that this effect was related to a joint mu-suppression deficit over the occipito-parietal regions and an increase over the frontal regions. These findings suggest peculiarities in top-down response modulation in ASD and question the claim of a global dysfunction of the MNS in autism. This research also advocates for the use of finer grained analyses at both spatial and spectral levels for future directions in neurophysiological accounts of autism. ",

fMRI","Although emotion dysregulation, one of the core features of depression, has long been thought to be a vulnerability factor for major depressive disorder (MDD), surprisingly few functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have investigated neural correlates of emotion regulation strategies in unaffected high risk individuals. Sixteen high risk (RSK) young women and fifteen matched low risk controls (CTL) were scanned using fMRI while performing an emotion regulation task. During this task, participants were instructed to reappraise their negative emotions elicited by International Affective Picture System images (IAPS). In addition, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Strategies Scale (DERS) was used to assess participants' emotion dysregulation levels. Both RSK and CTL individuals show increased amygdala activation in response to negative emotional stimuli, however no difference was found between groups in using cognitive reappraisal strategies and functions of brain regions implicated in cognitive reappraisal. Interestingly, our psychometric test results indicate that high risk individuals are characterised by lower perceived emotional clarity (EC). Results of the current study suggest depression vulnerability may not be linked to the effectiveness of cognitive reappraisal. Alternatively, lower EC may be a vulnerability factor for depression.

FMRI experiments demonstrated consistent activations in regions of the brain associated with working memory. Children with FASD displayed greater inferior-middle frontal lobe activity, while greater superior frontal and parietal lobe activity was observed in controls. Control children also showed an overall increase in frontal lobe activity with increasing task difficulty, while children with FASD showed decreased activity. FASD adults demonstrated less functional brain activity overall, but greater inferior-middle frontal lobe activity during the simpler tasks, relative to controls. Control adults demonstrated greater inferior frontal activity with increasing task difficulty, while this pattern was not consistently observed in FASD adults. All four groups showed increasing activity with increases in task difficulty in the parietal and frontal regions at more superior slice levels. The results suggest impairment in spatial working memory in those with FASD that does not improve with age, and that fMRI may be useful in evaluation of brain function in these individuals. ",
pmid_21850664,No evidence for a fundamental visual motion processing deficit in adolescents with autism spectrum disorders.,,"It has been suggested that atypicalities in low-level visual processing contribute to the expression and development of the unusual cognitive and behavioral profile seen in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, previous investigations have yielded mixed results. In the largest study of its kind (ASD n = 89; non-ASD = 52; mean age 15 years 6 months) and testing across the spectrum of IQ (range 52-133), we investigated performance on three measures of basic visual processing: motion coherence, form-from-motion and biological motion (BM). At the group level, we found no evidence of differences between the two groups on any of the tasks, suggesting that there is no fundamental visual motion processing deficit in individuals with an ASD, at least by adolescence. However, we identified a tail of individuals with ASD (18% of the sample) who had exceptionally poor BM processing abilities compared to the non-ASD group, and who were characterized by low IQ. For the entire sample of those both with and without ASD, performance on the BM task uniquely correlated with performance on the Frith-Happé animations, a higher-level task that demands the interpretation of moving, interacting agents in order to understand mental states. We hypothesize that this association reflects the shared social-cognitive characteristics of the two tasks, which have a common neural underpinning in the superior temporal sulcus. ",

In this longitudinal study, we assessed whether neuroanatomical and functional abnormalities were reversible and dependent on treatment outcomes. We acquired MRI scans from chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients before (n = 18) and 6 months after (spine surgery or facet joint injections; n = 14) treatment. In addition, we scanned 16 healthy controls, 10 of which returned 6 months after the first visit. We performed cortical thickness analysis on structural MRI scans, and subjects performed a cognitive task during the functional MRI. We compared patients and controls, as well as patients before versus after treatment. After treatment, patients had increased cortical thickness in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which was thinner before treatment compared with controls. Increased DLPFC thickness correlated with the reduction of both pain and physical disability. Additionally, increased thickness in primary motor cortex was associated specifically with reduced physical disability, and right anterior insula was associated specifically with reduced pain. Left DLPFC activity during an attention-demanding cognitive task was abnormal before treatment, but normalized following treatment. These data indicate that functional and structural brain abnormalities-specifically in the left DLPFC-are reversible, suggesting that treating chronic pain can restore normal brain function in humans.

Spontaneous activity","Previous autism research has hypothesized that abnormalities of functional connectivity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may vary with the spatial distance between two brain regions. Although several resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) studies have extensively examined long-range (or distant) connectivity in the adult ASD brain, short-range (or local) connectivity has been investigated in less depth. Furthermore, the possible relationship between functional connectivity and brain activity level during the resting state remains unclear. We acquired rsfMRI data from 50 adults with high-functioning ASD and 50 matched controls to examine the properties of spontaneous brain activity using measures of local and distant connectivity together with a measure of the amplitude of brain activity, known as fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF). The two connectivity measures were calculated using a common graph-theoretic framework. We also examined the spatial overlaps between these measures and possible relationships of these disrupted functional measures with autistic traits assessed by the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Compared to the controls, participants with ASD exhibited local over-connectivity in the right superior frontal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus, accompanied by local under-connectivity in the bilateral fusiform gyri (FG) and right middle temporal gyrus (MTG). On the other hand, we did not find any significant alterations in distant connectivity. Participants with ASD also exhibited reduced fALFF in the right middle occipital gyrus, lingual gyrus, and FG. Further conjunction and spatial overlap analyses confirmed that the spatial pattern of reduced fALFF substantially overlapped with that of local under-connectivity, demonstrating the co-occurrence of disrupted connectivity and spontaneous activity level in the right inferior occipital gyrus, posterior MTG (pMTG), and FG. Finally, within the ASD group, disrupted local connectivity in the right pMTG significantly correlated with the ""social interaction"" subscale score of the AQ. These findings revealed local functional disruptions in the occipital and temporal regions, especially the right FG and pMTG, in the form of co-occurrence of spontaneous brain activity level and local connectivity, which may underline social and communicative dysfunctions in adult ASD.

pmid_19409224,Neuroimaging of response interference in twins concordant or discordant for inattention and hyperactivity symptoms.,,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is to a large extent influenced by genetic factors, but environmental influences are considered important as well. To distinguish between functional brain changes underlying primarily genetically and environmentally mediated ADHD, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare response interference in monozygotic twins highly concordant or discordant for attention problems (AP). AP scores were assessed longitudinally with the Child Behavior Check List attention problem scale (CBCL-AP). Response interference was measured during two executive function paradigms; a color-word Stroop and a flanker task. The neuroimaging results indicated that, across the entire sample, children with high CBCL-AP scores, relative to children with low CBCL-AP scores, showed decreased activation to response interference in dorsolateral prefrontal, parietal and temporal brain regions. Increased activation was noted in the premotor cortex and regions associated with visual selective attention processing, possibly reflecting compensatory mechanisms to maintain task performance. Specific comparisons of high and low scoring concordant twin pairs suggest that AP of genetic origin was characterized by decreased activation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during the Stroop task and right parietal lobe during the flanker task. In contrast, comparison of twins from discordant monozygotic pairs, suggests that AP of environmental origin was characterized by decreased activation in left and right temporal lobe areas, but only during Stroop interference. The finding of distinct brain activation changes to response interference in inattention/hyperactivity of ""genetic"" versus ""environmental"" origin, indicates that genetic and environmental risk factors for attention/hyperactivity problems affect the brain in different ways.

pmid_20621407,Brain responses differ to faces of mothers and fathers.,,"We encounter many faces each day but relatively few are personally familiar. Once faces are familiar, they evoke semantic and social information known about the person. Neuroimaging studies demonstrate differential brain activity to familiar and non-familiar faces; however, brain responses related to personally familiar faces have been more rarely studied. We examined brain activity with fMRI in adults in response to faces of their mothers and fathers compared to faces of celebrities and strangers. Overall, faces of mothers elicited more activity in core and extended brain regions associated with face processing, compared to fathers, celebrity or stranger faces. Fathers' faces elicited activity in the caudate, a deep brain structure associated with feelings of love. These new findings of differential brain responses elicited by faces of mothers and fathers are consistent with psychological research on attachment, evident even during adulthood. ",
pmid_16794848,Bilateral basal ganglia activation associated with sensorimotor adaptation.,,"Sensorimotor adaptation tasks can be classified into two types. When subjects adapt movements to visual feedback perturbations such as in prism lens adaptation, they perform kinematic adaptations. When subjects adapt movements to force field perturbations such as with robotic manipulanda, they perform kinetic adaptations. Neuroimaging studies have shown basal ganglia involvement in kinetic adaptations, but have found little evidence of basal ganglia involvement in kinematic adaptations, despite reports of deficits in patients with diseases of the basal ganglia, such as Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, in these. In an effort to resolve such apparent discrepancy, we used FMRI to focus on the first few minutes of practice during kinematic adaptation. Human subjects adapted to visuomotor rotations in the context of a joystick aiming task while lying supine in a 3.0 T MRI scanner. As demonstrated previously, early adaptive processes were associated with BOLD activation in the cerebellum and the sensory and motor cortical regions. A novel finding of this study was bilateral basal ganglia activation. This suggests that, at least for early learning, the neural correlates of kinematic adaptation parallel those of other types of skill learning. We observed activation in the right globus pallidus and putamen, along with the right prefrontal, premotor and parietal cortex, which may support spatial cognitive processes of adaptation. We also observed activation in the left globus pallidus and caudate nucleus, along with the left premotor and supplementary motor cortex, which may support the sensorimotor processes of adaptation. These results are the first to demonstrate a clear involvement of basal ganglia activation in this type of kinematic motor adaptation. ",
pmid_23159796,"Decreased interhemispheric resting-state functional connectivity in first-episode, drug-naive major depressive disorder.",,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is shown to have structural and functional abnormalities in specific brain areas and connections by recent neuroimaging studies. However, little is known about the alterations of the interhemispheric resting-state functional connectivity (FC) in patients with MDD. In the present study, we used a newly developed voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) method to investigate the interhemispheric FC of the whole brain in patients with MDD at rest. Twenty-four first-episode, drug-naive patients with MDD and 24 age-, gender-, and education-matched healthy subjects underwent a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An automated VMHC approach was used to analyze the data. Patients with MDD showed lower VMHC than healthy subjects in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCu), two core regions within default mode network (DMN). Both left and right MPFC showed reduced FC with the other frontal areas and with right anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC), while PCC/PCu exhibited abnormal FC with the frontal areas and thalamus in patient group. Significant positive correlation was observed between VMHC in MPFC and persistent error response of Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST-Pre) in patients. Further ROC analysis revealed that VMHC in the MPFC and PCC/PCu could be used to differentiate the patients from healthy subjects with relatively high sensitivity and specificity. Our results suggest that decreased VMHC in brain regions within DMN may underlie the pathogenesis of MDD. ",
pmid_22209236,Reduced striatal activation during reward anticipation due to appetite-provoking cues in chronic schizophrenia: a fMRI study.,,"The occurrence of weight gain in schizophrenia (SZ) has profound clinical impact and interacts with antipsychotic medication, life style and disease severity. The functional neuroanatomy underlying altered nutritional behavior is unraveled, but dysregulated reward anticipation might be one of the involved neuronal mechanisms. The striatum, a core region of the reward network and salience attribution, was previously shown to regulate appetite perception and eating behavior. We studied patients suffering from chronic schizophrenia with a stable medication in comparison to age and gender matched healthy adults. Every subject had to undergo a 6h fasting period before a newly developed, appetite-provoking fMRI task was applied. Subjects saw visual stimuli of appetitive food items in a 3Tesla scanner. In healthy controls food images elicited stronger activation in the striatum compared to SZ patients. When adjusting a ROI-based striatal activation for medication and weight, the group difference remained still significant. This points an effect of illness independent of antipsychotic medication. These data underscore the involvement of the striatum into salience attribution, reward anticipation and the neuronal pathways leading to altered eating behavior and weight gain in schizophrenia. ",

action perception
mu rhythm","There have been some controversies over the ability of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to perceive biological motion. In this study, we used electroencephalography and behavioural measures (recognition test) to examine whether or not children with ASD can correctly identify biological motion. Twenty participants with ASD (mean = 11.3, SD = 2.1 years) and 20 typically developed (TD) participants (mean = 11.4, SD = 2.8 years) participated in the study. They watched videos and point light displays of actions, and their EEG was recorded. Then they answered action recognition test, and their accuracy and response times were recorded. Our findings showed that children with ASD had the same mu suppression as a TD age-matched control group in both point light display and video presentations. Furthermore, the results showed that while TD and ASD groups did not differ in accuracy, ASD participants had a slower reaction time. Taken together, our results indicate that the perception of non-emotional BMs is preserved in children with ASD. ",
pmid_18556560,Transfer of learning after updating training mediated by the striatum.,,"Process-specific training can improve performance on untrained tasks, but the magnitude of gain is variable and often there is no transfer at all. We demonstrate transfer to a 3-back test of working memory after 5 weeks of training in updating. The transfer effect was based on a joint training-related activity increase for the criterion (letter memory) and transfer tasks in a striatal region that also was recruited pretraining. No transfer was observed to a task that did not engage updating and striatal regions, and age-related striatal changes imposed constraints on transfer. These findings indicate that transfer can occur if the criterion and transfer tasks engage specific overlapping processing components and brain regions. ",
pmid_24204226,Keeping up with the Joneses: interpersonal prediction errors and the correlation of behavior in a tandem sequential choice task.,,"In many settings, copying, learning from or assigning value to group behavior is rational because such behavior can often act as a proxy for valuable returns. However, such herd behavior can also be pathologically misleading by coaxing individuals into behaviors that are otherwise irrational and it may be one source of the irrational behaviors underlying market bubbles and crashes. Using a two-person tandem investment game, we sought to examine the neural and behavioral responses of herd instincts in situations stripped of the incentive to be influenced by the choices of one's partner. We show that the investments of the two subjects correlate over time if they are made aware of their partner's choices even though these choices have no impact on either player's earnings. We computed an ""interpersonal prediction error"", the difference between the investment decisions of the two subjects after each choice. BOLD responses in the striatum, implicated in valuation and action selection, were highly correlated with this interpersonal prediction error. The revelation of the partner's investment occurred after all useful information about the market had already been revealed. This effect was confirmed in two separate experiments where the impact of the time of revelation of the partner's choice was tested at 2 seconds and 6 seconds after a subject's choice; however, the effect was absent in a control condition with a computer partner. These findings strongly support the existence of mechanisms that drive correlated behavior even in contexts where there is no explicit advantage to do so. ",
pmid_19240137,The neural architecture of music-evoked autobiographical memories.,,"The medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) is regarded as a region of the brain that supports self-referential processes, including the integration of sensory information with self-knowledge and the retrieval of autobiographical information. I used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a novel procedure for eliciting autobiographical memories with excerpts of popular music dating to one's extended childhood to test the hypothesis that music and autobiographical memories are integrated in the MPFC. Dorsal regions of the MPFC (Brodmann area 8/9) were shown to respond parametrically to the degree of autobiographical salience experienced over the course of individual 30 s excerpts. Moreover, the dorsal MPFC also responded on a second, faster timescale corresponding to the signature movements of the musical excerpts through tonal space. These results suggest that the dorsal MPFC associates music and memories when we experience emotionally salient episodic memories that are triggered by familiar songs from our personal past. MPFC acted in concert with lateral prefrontal and posterior cortices both in terms of tonality tracking and overall responsiveness to familiar and autobiographically salient songs. These findings extend the results of previous autobiographical memory research by demonstrating the spontaneous activation of an autobiographical memory network in a naturalistic task with low retrieval demands. ",
pmid_18809234,Superior temporal activation in response to dynamic audio-visual emotional cues.,,"Perception of emotion is critical for successful social interaction, yet the neural mechanisms underlying the perception of dynamic, audio-visual emotional cues are poorly understood. Evidence from language and sensory paradigms suggests that the superior temporal sulcus and gyrus (STS/STG) play a key role in the integration of auditory and visual cues. Emotion perception research has focused on static facial cues; however, dynamic audio-visual (AV) cues mimic real-world social cues more accurately than static and/or unimodal stimuli. Novel dynamic AV stimuli were presented using a block design in two fMRI studies, comparing bimodal stimuli to unimodal conditions, and emotional to neutral stimuli. Results suggest that the bilateral superior temporal region plays distinct roles in the perception of emotion and in the integration of auditory and visual cues. Given the greater ecological validity of the stimuli developed for this study, this paradigm may be helpful in elucidating the deficits in emotion perception experienced by clinical populations. ",
pmid_25916336,The effects of acupuncture treatment on the right frontoparietal network in migraine without aura patients.,,"Functional and structural abnormalities in resting-state brain networks in migraine patients have been confirmed by previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. However, few studies focusing on the neural responses of therapeutic treatment on migraine have been conducted. In this study, we tried to examined the treatment-related effects of standard acupuncture treatment on the right frontoparietal network (RFPN) in migraine patients. A total of 12 migraine without aura (MWoA) patients were recruited to undergo resting-state fMRI scanning and were rescanned after 4 weeks standard acupuncture treatment. Another 12 matched healthy control (HC) subjects underwent once scanning for comparison. We analyzed the functional connectivity of the RFPN between MWoA patients and HC subjects before treatment and that of the MWoA patients before and after treatment. Diffusion tensor images (DTI) data analyzing was also performed to detect fiber-related treatment responses. We observed significantly decreased FC in the RFPN and that the decreased FC could be reversed by acupuncture treatment. The changes of FC in MWoA patients was negatively correlated with the decrease of visual analogue scale (VAS) scores after treatment. This study indicated that acupuncture treatment for MWoA patients was associated with normalizing effects on the intrinsic decreased FC of the RFPN. Our study provided new insights into the treatment-related neural responses in MWoA patients and suggested potential functional pathways for the evaluation of treatment in MWoA patients. Future studies are still in need to confirm the current results and to elucidate the complex neural mechanisms of acupuncture treatment. ",
pmid_18339559,Spatio-temporal characteristics of low-frequency BOLD signal fluctuations in isoflurane-anesthetized rat brain.,,"We studied the spatio-temporal characteristics of the resting state low-frequency fluctuations in fMRI-BOLD signal in isoflurane-anesthetized rats. fMRI-BOLD measurements at 9.4 T were made during normal and exsanguinated condition previously known to alter cerebral blood flow (CBF) fluctuations in anesthetized rats. fMRI signal time series were low pass filtered and studied by spectral analysis. During normal conditions, baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP) was 110+/-10 mm Hg and low-frequency fluctuations in BOLD signal were observed in the frequency range of 0.01 to 0.125 Hz. Following blood withdrawal (exsanguination), MAP decreased to 68+/-7 mm Hg, resulting in an increase in the amplitude of the low-frequency fluctuations in BOLD signal time series and an increase in power at several frequencies between 0.01 and 0.125 Hz. Spatially, the BOLD fluctuations were confined to the cortex and thalamus spanning both hemispheres with sparse presence in the caudate putamen and hippocampus during both normal and exsanguinated states. Spatial distribution of the low-frequency fluctuations in BOLD signal, from cross-correlation analysis, indicates substantial inter-hemispheric synchrony similar to that observed in the conscious human brain. The behavior of the resting state BOLD signal fluctuations similar to CBF fluctuations during exsanguination indicates a myogenic dependence. Also, a high inter-hemispheric synchrony combined with different phase characteristics of the low-frequency BOLD fluctuations particularly in the hippocampus relative to the cortex emphasizes distinct functional networks. ",
pmid_22870240,Hypersensitivity in borderline personality disorder during mindreading.,,"One of the core symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD) is the instability in interpersonal relationships. This might be related to existent differences in mindreading between BPD patients and healthy individuals. We examined the behavioural and neurophysiological (fMRI) responses of BPD patients and healthy controls (HC) during performance of the 'Reading the Mind in the Eyes' test (RMET). Mental state discrimination was significantly better and faster for affective eye gazes in BPD patients than in HC. At the neurophysiological level, this was manifested in a stronger activation of the amygdala and greater activity of the medial frontal gyrus, the left temporal pole and the middle temporal gyrus during affective eye gazes. In contrast, HC subjects showed a greater activation in the insula and the superior temporal gyri. These findings indicate that BPD patients are highly vigilant to social stimuli, maybe because they resonate intuitively with mental states of others. ",
pmid_15110011,A functional MRI study of the influence of practice on component processes of working memory.,,"Previous neuroimaging studies have shown that neural activity changes with task practice. The types of changes reported have been inconsistent, however, and the neural mechanisms involved remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the influence of practice on different component processes of working memory (WM) using a face WM task. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methodology allowed us to examine signal changes from early to late in the scanning session within different task stages (i.e., encoding, delay, retrieval), as well as to determine the influence of different levels of WM load on neural activity. We found practice-related decreases in fMRI signal and effects of memory load occurring primarily during encoding. This suggests that practice improves encoding efficiency, especially at higher memory loads. The decreases in fMRI signal we observed were not accompanied by improved behavioral performance; in fact, error rate increased for high WM load trials, indicating that practice-related changes in activation may occur during a scanning session without behavioral evidence of learning. Our results suggest that practice influences particular component processes of WM differently, and that the efficiency of these processes may not be captured by performance measures alone. ",
pmid_25577954,Is avolition in schizophrenia associated with a deficit of dorsal caudate activity? A functional magnetic resonance imaging study during reward anticipation and feedback.,ventral striatum,"The neurobiological underpinnings of avolition in schizophrenia remain unclear. Most brain imaging research has focused on reward prediction deficit and on ventral striatum dysfunction, but findings are not consistent. In the light of accumulating evidence that both ventral striatum and dorsal caudate play a key role in motivation, we investigated ventral striatum and dorsal caudate activation during processing of reward or loss in patients with schizophrenia. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to study brain activation during a Monetary Incentive Delay task in patients with schizophrenia, treated with second-generation antipsychotics only, and in healthy controls (HC). We also assessed the relationships of ventral striatum and dorsal caudate activation with measures of hedonic experience and motivation. The whole patient group had lower motivation but comparable hedonic experience and striatal activation than HC. Patients with high avolition scores showed lower dorsal caudate activation than both HC and patients with low avolition scores. A lower dorsal caudate activation was also observed in patients with deficit schizophrenia compared to HC and patients with non-deficit schizophrenia. Dorsal caudate activity during reward anticipation was significantly associated with avolition, but not with anhedonia in the patient group. These findings suggest that avolition in schizophrenia is linked to dorsal caudate hypoactivation. ",
pmid_18827719,Integrating functional brain neuroimaging and developmental cognitive neuroscience in child psychiatry research.,,"To provide an overview of clinical research aiming to develop a mechanistic understanding of brain dysfunction in child psychiatric disorders. Technological, conceptual, and translational approaches relevant to the investigation of brain function in pediatric psychiatric illnesses are explored. Research in the area of pediatric bipolar disorder is used as a prototypic model illustrating the use of complementary techniques of functional magnetic neuroimaging and neurocognitive studies to identify abnormalities in neural circuitry function. Studies of bipolar youths indicate impairment in cognitive and affective neural systems and in the interface of these two circuits. This evolving field paves a future pathway for identifying diagnostic biomarkers for the disorder, providing tools for monitoring response to pharmacotherapy, examining illness-associated alterations in developmental trajectory, and facilitating the use of animal research for guiding the development of novel treatment strategies. Studies of brain function in child psychiatry are establishing a platform of knowledge and methods that offer promise for revolutionizing both models of illness pathophysiology and future diagnostic and therapeutic practice.

pmid_21574212,The mentalizing network orchestrates the impact of parochial altruism on social norm enforcement.,,"Parochial altruism--a preference for altruistic behavior towards ingroup members and mistrust or hostility towards outgroup members--is a pervasive feature in human society and strongly shapes the enforcement of social norms. Since the uniqueness of human society critically depends on the enforcement of norms, the understanding of the neural circuitry of the impact of parochial altruism on social norm enforcement is key, but unexplored. To fill this gap, we measured brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while subjects had the opportunity to punish ingroup members and outgroup members for violating social norms. Findings revealed that subjects' strong punishment of defecting outgroup members is associated with increased activity in a functionally connected network involved in sanction-related decisions (right orbitofrontal gyrus, right lateral prefrontal cortex, right dorsal caudatus). Moreover, the stronger the connectivity in this network, the more outgroup members are punished. In contrast, the much weaker punishment of ingroup members who committed the very same norm violation is associated with increased activity and connectivity in the mentalizing-network (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, bilateral temporo-parietal junction), as if subjects tried to understand or justify ingroup members' behavior. Finally, connectivity analyses between the two networks suggest that the mentalizing-network modulates punishment by affecting the activity in the right orbitofrontal gyrus and right lateral prefrontal cortex, notably in the same areas showing enhanced activity and connectivity whenever third-parties strongly punished defecting outgroup members.

Using anisotropic effect-size seed-based d mapping (AES-SDM) software with its recently-developed meta-analytic thickness mask, we conducted a meta-analysis of published studies which used whole-brain surface-based morphometry, in order to define consistent cortical thickness alterations in PTSD patients. Eleven studies with 438 patients and 396 controls were included. Compared with all controls, patients with PTSD showed increased cortical thickness in right superior temporal gyrus, and in left and right superior frontal gyrus; the former survived in subgroup analysis of adult patients, and in subgroup comparison with only non-PTSD trauma-exposed controls, the latter in subgroup comparison with only non-trauma-exposed healthy controls. Cortical thickness in right superior frontal gyrus was positively associated with percentage of female patients, and cortical thickness in left superior frontal gyrus was positively associated with symptom severity measured by the clinician-administered PTSD scale. These robust results may help to elucidate the pathophysiology of PTSD. ",

Two separate meta-analyses for functional neural activation and gray-matter volume were conducted. Sub-meta-analyses for the domains of reward, cold-executive, and hot-executive functions were also performed, respectively. IGD subjects, compared with healthy controls, showed: (1) hyperactivation in the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices, caudate, posterior inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), which were mainly associated with studies measuring reward and cold-executive functions; and, (2) hypoactivation in the anterior IFG in relation to hot-executive function, the posterior insula, somatomotor and somatosensory cortices in relation to reward function. Furthermore, IGD subjects showed reduced gray-matter volume in the anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal, dorsolateral prefrontal, and premotor cortices. These findings suggest that IGD is associated with both functional and structural neural alterations in fronto-striatal and fronto-cingulate regions. Moreover, multi-domain assessments capture different aspects of neural alterations in IGD, which may be helpful for developing effective interventions targeting specific functions. ",

Yet, little is known about the neuropsychological mechanisms underlying adolescent CUDs. Studies in adult cannabis users suggest a significant role for cognitive control and cannabis-oriented motivational processes, such as attentional bias, approach bias, and craving in CUDs. The current 6-month prospective study investigated the relationships between attentional bias, approach bias, craving, cognitive control, and cannabis use in adolescent patients in treatment for a primary or secondary CUD. Moreover, we investigated if these motivational processes and cognitive control could predict treatment progression after 6 months. Adolescents with a CUD had an attentional but no approach bias towards cannabis. In contrast to adult findings on the role of attentional bias, approach bias and cognitive control, only cannabis craving significantly correlated with current cannabis use and predicted cannabis use-related problems and abstinence from cannabis 6 months later. These findings identify craving as a predictor of treatment outcome, thereby supporting an important role for craving in the course of adolescent cannabis use and dependence. This prospective study is among the first to investigate neuropsychological mechanisms underlying adolescent CUDs, warranting future longitudinal studies. ",
pmid_22136749,Neural mechanisms mediating the effects of expectation in visceral placebo analgesia: an fMRI study in healthy placebo responders and nonresponders.,,"This functional magnetic resonance imaging study analysed the behavioural and neural responses during expectation-mediated placebo analgesia in a rectal pain model in healthy subjects. In N=36 healthy subjects, the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response during cued anticipation and painful rectal stimulation was measured. Using a within-subject design, placebo analgesia was induced by changing expectations regarding the probability of receiving an analgesic drug to 0%, 50%, and 100%. Placebo responders were identified by median split based on pain reduction (0% to 100% conditions), and changes in neural activation correlating with pain reduction in the 0% and 100% conditions were assessed in a regions-of-interest analysis. Expectation of pain relief resulted in overall reductions in pain and urge to defecate, and this response was significantly more pronounced in responders. Within responders, pain reduction correlated with reduced activation of dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices, somatosensory cortex, and thalamus during cued anticipation (paired t tests on the contrast 0%>100%); during painful stimulation, pain reduction correlated with reduced activation of the thalamus. Compared with nonresponders, responders demonstrated greater placebo-induced decreases in activation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during anticipation and in somatosensory cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and thalamus during pain. In conclusion, the expectation of pain relief can substantially change perceived painfulness of visceral stimuli, which is associated with activity changes in the thalamus, prefrontal, and somatosensory cortices. Placebo analgesia constitutes a paradigm to elucidate psychological components of the pain response relevant to the pathophysiology and treatment of chronic abdominal pain. ",
pmid_11430815,Effects of attention and emotion on face processing in the human brain: an event-related fMRI study.,,"We used event-related fMRI to assess whether brain responses to fearful versus neutral faces are modulated by spatial attention. Subjects performed a demanding matching task for pairs of stimuli at prespecified locations, in the presence of task-irrelevant stimuli at other locations. Faces or houses unpredictably appeared at the relevant or irrelevant locations, while the faces had either fearful or neutral expressions. Activation of fusiform gyri by faces was strongly affected by attentional condition, but the left amygdala response to fearful faces was not. Right fusiform activity was greater for fearful than neutral faces, independently of the attention effect on this region. These results reveal differential influences on face processing from attention and emotion, with the amygdala response to threat-related expressions unaffected by a manipulation of attention that strongly modulates the fusiform response to faces.

reward prediction errors","Computational models of reward processing suggest that foregone or fictive outcomes serve as important information sources for learning and augment those generated by experienced rewards (e.g. reward prediction errors). An outstanding question is how these learning signals interact with top-down cognitive influences, such as cognitive reappraisal strategies. Using a sequential investment task and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show that the reappraisal strategy selectively attenuates the influence of fictive, but not reward prediction error signals on investment behavior; such behavioral effect is accompanied by changes in neural activity and connectivity in the anterior insular cortex, a brain region thought to integrate subjective feelings with high-order cognition. Furthermore, individuals differ in the extent to which their behaviors are driven by fictive errors versus reward prediction errors, and the reappraisal strategy interacts with such individual differences; a finding also accompanied by distinct underlying neural mechanisms. These findings suggest that the variable interaction of cognitive strategies with two important classes of computational learning signals (fictive, reward prediction error) represent one contributing substrate for the variable capacity of individuals to control their behavior based on foregone rewards. These findings also expose important possibilities for understanding the lack of control in addiction based on possibly foregone rewarding outcomes. ",
pmid_11553288,Human brain activity in the control of fine static precision grip forces: an fMRI study.,,"Dexterous manipulation of delicate objects requires exquisite control of fingertip forces. We have used functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify brain regions involved in the skillful scaling of these forces when normal human subjects (n = 8) held with precision grip a small object (weight 200 g) in the dominant right hand. In one condition, they used their normal, automatically scaled grip force. The object was held gently in a second condition; the isometric grip force was maintained just above the critical level at which the object would have slipped. In a third condition, the force was increased to hold the object with a more firm grip. The supplementary and cingulate motor areas were significantly more active during the gentle force condition than during either of the other conditions in all subjects, despite weaker contractions of the hand muscles. In addition, the left primary sensorimotor cortex, the ventral premotor cortex and the left posterior parietal cortex were more strongly activated during gentle than during normal grasping. These novel results suggest that these regions are specifically involved in dexterous scaling of fingertip forces during object manipulation. ",
pmid_18433774,Reduced hedonic capacity in major depressive disorder: evidence from a probabilistic reward task.,,"Anhedonia, the lack of reactivity to pleasurable stimuli, is a cardinal feature of depression that has received renewed interest as a potential endophenotype of this debilitating disease. The goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that individuals with major depression are characterized by blunted reward responsiveness, particularly when anhedonic symptoms are prominent. A probabilistic reward task rooted within signal-detection theory was utilized to objectively assess hedonic capacity in 23 unmedicated subjects meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) and 25 matched control subjects recruited from the community. Hedonic capacity was defined as reward responsiveness - i.e., the participants' propensity to modulate behavior as a function of reward. Compared to controls, MDD subjects showed significantly reduced reward responsiveness. Trial-by-trial probability analyses revealed that MDD subjects, while responsive to delivery of single rewards, were impaired at integrating reinforcement history over time and expressing a response bias toward a more frequently rewarded cue in the absence of immediate reward. This selective impairment correlated with self-reported anhedonic symptoms, even after considering anxiety symptoms and general distress. These findings indicate that MDD is characterized by an impaired tendency to modulate behavior as a function of prior reinforcements, and provides initial clues about which aspects of hedonic processing might be dysfunctional in depression.

pmid_20463224,Neural processing of risk.,,"In our everyday life, we often have to make decisions with risky consequences, such as choosing a restaurant for dinner or choosing a form of retirement saving. To date, however, little is known about how the brain processes risk. Recent conceptualizations of risky decision making highlight that it is generally associated with emotions but do not specify how emotions are implicated in risk processing. Moreover, little is known about risk processing in non-choice situations and how potential losses influence risk processing. Here we used quantitative meta-analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments on risk processing in the brain to investigate (1) how risk processing is influenced by emotions, (2) how it differs between choice and non-choice situations, and (3) how it changes when losses are possible. By showing that, over a range of experiments and paradigms, risk is consistently represented in the anterior insula, a brain region known to process aversive emotions such as anxiety, disappointment, or regret, we provide evidence that risk processing is influenced by emotions. Furthermore, our results show risk-related activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex in choice situations but not in situations in which no choice is involved or a choice has already been made. The anterior insula was predominantly active in the presence of potential losses, indicating that potential losses modulate risk processing. ",
pmid_17298595,Retrosplenial and hippocampal brain regions in human navigation: complementary functional contributions to the formation and use of cognitive maps.,,"The ability to orientate within familiar environments relies on the formation and use of a mental representation of the environment, namely a cognitive map. Neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies suggest that the retrosplenial and hippocampal brain regions are involved in topographical orientation. We combined functional magnetic resonance imaging with a virtual-reality paradigm to investigate the functional interaction of the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex during the formation and utilization of cognitive maps by human subjects. We found that the anterior hippocampus is involved during the formation of the cognitive map, while the posterior hippocampus is involved when using it. In conjunction with the hippocampus, the retrosplenial cortex was active during both the formation and the use of the cognitive map. In accordance with earlier studies in non-human animals, these findings suggest that, while navigating within the environment, the retrosplenial cortex complements the hippocampal contribution to topographical orientation by updating the individual's location as the frame of reference changes.

pmid_21126990,Gait-related cerebral alterations in patients with Parkinson's disease with freezing of gait.,,"Freezing of gait is a common, debilitating feature of Parkinson's disease. We have studied gait planning in patients with freezing of gait, using motor imagery of walking in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging. This approach exploits the large neural overlap that exists between planning and imagining a movement. In addition, it avoids confounds introduced by brain responses to altered motor performance and somatosensory feedback during actual freezing episodes. We included 24 patients with Parkinson's disease: 12 patients with freezing of gait, 12 matched patients without freezing of gait and 21 matched healthy controls. Subjects performed two previously validated tasks--motor imagery of gait and a visual imagery control task. During functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning, we quantified imagery performance by measuring the time required to imagine walking on paths of different widths and lengths. In addition, we used voxel-based morphometry to test whether between-group differences in imagery-related activity were related to structural differences. Imagery times indicated that patients with freezing of gait, patients without freezing of gait and controls engaged in motor imagery of gait, with matched task performance. During motor imagery of gait, patients with freezing of gait showed more activity than patients without freezing of gait in the mesencephalic locomotor region. Patients with freezing of gait also tended to have decreased responses in mesial frontal and posterior parietal regions. Furthermore, patients with freezing of gait had grey matter atrophy in a small portion of the mesencephalic locomotor region. The gait-related hyperactivity of the mesencephalic locomotor region correlated with clinical parameters (freezing of gait severity and disease duration), but not with the degree of atrophy. These results indicate that patients with Parkinson's disease with freezing of gait have structural and functional alterations in the mesencephalic locomotor region. We suggest that freezing of gait might emerge when altered cortical control of gait is combined with a limited ability of the mesencephalic locomotor region to react to that alteration. These limitations might become particularly evident during challenging events that require precise regulation of step length and gait timing, such as turning or initiating walking, which are known triggers for freezing of gait.

pmid_23696841,Disorder-specific predictive classification of adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) relative to autism using structural magnetic resonance imaging.,,"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, but diagnosed by subjective clinical and rating measures. The study's aim was to apply Gaussian process classification (GPC) to grey matter (GM) volumetric data, to assess whether individual ADHD adolescents can be accurately differentiated from healthy controls based on objective, brain structure measures and whether this is disorder-specific relative to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Twenty-nine adolescent ADHD boys and 29 age-matched healthy and 19 boys with ASD were scanned. GPC was applied to make disorder-specific predictions of ADHD diagnostic status based on individual brain structure patterns. In addition, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis tested for traditional univariate group level differences in GM. The pattern of GM correctly classified 75.9% of patients and 82.8% of controls, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 79.3%. Furthermore, classification was disorder-specific relative to ASD. The discriminating GM patterns showed higher classification weights for ADHD in earlier developing ventrolateral/premotor fronto-temporo-limbic and stronger classification weights for healthy controls in later developing dorsolateral fronto-striato-parieto-cerebellar networks. Several regions were also decreased in GM in ADHD relative to healthy controls in the univariate VBM analysis, suggesting they are GM deficit areas. The study provides evidence that pattern recognition analysis can provide significant individual diagnostic classification of ADHD patients and healthy controls based on distributed GM patterns with 79.3% accuracy and that this is disorder-specific relative to ASD. Findings are a promising first step towards finding an objective differential diagnostic tool based on brain imaging measures to aid with the subjective clinical diagnosis of ADHD. ",
pmid_10645748,Functional neuroanatomy of spatial working memory in children.,,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine spatial working memory in 8- to 11-year-old children tested under three conditions. In the visual condition, children were asked to examine the location of a dot on a screen. In the motor condition, children were instructed to push a button that corresponded to the location of a dot presented on a screen. In the memory condition, children were asked to remember the location of a dot presented 1 or 2 trials previously. Subtracting the activation of the motor condition from the memory condition revealed activity in the dorsal aspects of the prefrontal cortex and in the posterior parietal and anterior cingulate cortex. These findings were also obtained in the analysis of the memory minus visual conditions except that motor cortex activation was also observed. These findings parallel those reported in comparable studies of adults and suggest that fMRI may be a useful means of examining function-structure relations in developmental populations. ",
pmid_35031640,Association of plasma tryptophan concentration with periaqueductal gray matter functional connectivity in migraine patients.,,"Altered periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) functional connectivity contributes to brain hyperexcitability in migraine. Although tryptophan modulates neurotransmission in PAG projections through its metabolic pathways, the effect of plasma tryptophan on PAG functional connectivity (PAG-FC) in migraine has not been investigated yet. In this study, using a matched case-control design PAG-FC was measured during a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging session in migraine without aura patients (n = 27) and healthy controls (n = 27), and its relationship with plasma tryptophan concentration (TRP) was assessed. In addition, correlations of PAG-FC with age at migraine onset, migraine frequency, trait-anxiety and depressive symptoms were tested and the effect of TRP on these correlations was explored. Our results demonstrated that migraineurs had higher TRP compared to controls. In addition, altered PAG-FC in regions responsible for fear-cascade and pain modulation correlated with TRP only in migraineurs. There was no significant correlation in controls. It suggests increased sensitivity to TRP in migraine patients compared to controls. Trait-anxiety and depressive symptoms correlated with PAG-FC in migraine patients, and these correlations were modulated by TRP in regions responsible for emotional aspects of pain processing, but TRP did not interfere with processes that contribute to migraine attack generation or attack frequency.

pmid_18226833,Effective brain connectivity in children with reading difficulties during phonological processing.,,"Using Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined effective connectivity between three left hemisphere brain regions (inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, fusiform gyrus) and bilateral medial frontal gyrus in 12 children with reading difficulties (M age=12.4, range: 8.11-14.10) and 12 control children (M age=12.3, range: 8.9-14.11) during rhyming judgments to visually presented words. More difficult conflicting trials either had similar orthography but different phonology (e.g. pint-mint) or similar phonology but different orthography (e.g. jazz-has). Easier non-conflicting trials had similar orthography and phonology (e.g. dime-lime) or different orthography and phonology (e.g. staff-gain). The modulatory effect from left fusiform gyrus to left inferior parietal lobule was stronger in controls than in children with reading difficulties only for conflicting trials. Modulatory effects from left fusiform gyrus and left inferior parietal lobule to left inferior frontal gyrus were stronger for conflicting trials than for non-conflicting trials only in control children but not in children with reading difficulties. Modulatory effects from left inferior frontal gyrus to inferior parietal lobule, from medial frontal gyrus to left inferior parietal lobule, and from left inferior parietal lobule to medial frontal gyrus were positively correlated with reading skill only in control children. These findings suggest that children with reading difficulties have deficits in integrating orthography and phonology utilizing left inferior parietal lobule, and in engaging phonological rehearsal/segmentation utilizing left inferior frontal gyrus possibly through the indirect pathway connecting posterior to anterior language processing regions, especially when the orthographic and phonological information is conflicting.

Functional Imaging
Parkinson's Disease","This study used resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) to evaluate regional and network alterations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) with and without depression. We recruited 29 patients with PD with depression (PD-Dep), 30 patients with PD without depression (PD-NDep), and 30 normal controls. All participants underwent resting-state fMRI scans on a 3-T MR system. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of blood oxygen level-dependent signals was used to characterise regional cerebral function. Functional integration of the brain network was evaluated by seed-based correlation approach. The PD-Dep group showed significantly higher ALFF value in the left orbitofrontal area compared with both the PD-NDep and control groups (p<0.05 corrected by FWE). In patients with PD, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score was positively correlated with the ALFF value in the left orbitofrontal cortex (p<0.005 uncorrected). Brain network connectivity analysis revealed reduced functional connectivity of putamen in both PD subgroups. However, the PD-Dep group showed more distributed reduced connectivity in the prefrontal-limbic network than the PD-NDep group did (p<0.05 corrected by FWE). Our study demonstrates that PD-Dep patients are characterised by increased regional spontaneous neural activity in the orbitofrontal area and decreased functional integration within the prefrontal-limbic network. These findings may be helpful for facilitating further understanding of the potential mechanisms underlying depression in PD. ",
pmid_4549764,Pain reduction by focal electrical stimulation of the brain: an anatomical and behavioral analysis.,,"These experiments have examined several aspects of analgesia produced by focal electrical stimulation of the brain. (1) Anatomical locus of analgesic effects: only stimulation of the mesencephalic central gray matter and periventricular gray matter greatly reduced or totally abolished responsiveness to all noxious stimuli employed. Stimulation of other brain areas increased jump threshold to electric shock (septal nuclei, dorsomedial thalamic nucleus) and sometimes even abolished responsiveness to tissue destructive pinch (ventral tegmentum, dorsomedial thalamic nucleus), but never eliminated resonding to radiant heat applied to the tail. Stimulation of the ventrobasal complex of the thalamus and the lateral hypothalamus produced little or no analgesia at all. (2) Magnitude of analgesia: stimulation of the central and periventricular gray matter produced analgesia equal to or greater than 10 mg/kg morphine on all tests. (3) Relationship to reward: stimulation-produced analgesia was found not to be casually related to the rewarding properties of the stimulation. Analgesia was often produced by stimulation at electrode sites which did not support self-stimulation behavior; and many animals self-stimulated at high rates but were not analgesic. (4) Relationship to seizure activity: electrographic or overt motor seizure activity was not related to stimulation-produced analgesia. (5) By analogy with the site and mechanism of morphine action, it is proposed that focal electrical stimulation activates a pain suppressive system concentrated in periventricular and periaqueductal regions and its activation reduces responsiveness to noxious stimuli, at least in part, by blocking transmission of nociceptive information through the spinal cord.

pmid_26587289,The Plasticity of Brain Gray Matter and White Matter following Lower Limb Amputation.,,"Accumulating evidence has indicated that amputation induces functional reorganization in the sensory and motor cortices. However, the extent of structural changes after lower limb amputation in patients without phantom pain remains uncertain. We studied 17 adult patients with right lower limb amputation and 18 healthy control subjects using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. Cortical thickness and fractional anisotropy (FA) of white matter (WM) were investigated. In amputees, a thinning trend was seen in the left premotor cortex (PMC). Smaller clusters were also noted in the visual-to-motor regions. In addition, the amputees also exhibited a decreased FA in the right superior corona radiata and WM regions underlying the right temporal lobe and left PMC. Fiber tractography from these WM regions showed microstructural changes in the commissural fibers connecting the bilateral premotor cortices, compatible with the hypothesis that amputation can lead to a change in interhemispheric interactions. Finally, the lower limb amputees also displayed significant FA reduction in the right inferior frontooccipital fasciculus, which is negatively correlated with the time since amputation. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the amputation of lower limb could induce changes in the cortical representation of the missing limb and the underlying WM connections. ",

ventral striatum","Studies conducted in drug addiction suggest a transition in processing of drug-related cues from the ventral to the dorsal component of the striatum. However, this process has not been studied in a behavioral addiction. Assessment of this process in a non-drug addiction can provide insight into the pathophysiology of both substance and behavioral addictions. Thirty-nine male Internet gaming disorder (IGD) subjects and 23 male matched healthy controls (HCs) participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging during performance of a cue-reactivity task involving alternating presentation of Internet gaming-related stimuli (game cues) and general Internet surfing-related stimuli (control cues). Cue-induced neural activations in the ventral and dorsal striatum (DS) were compared between IGD and HC participants. Associations between cue-reactivity within these regions and cue-induced craving and severity and duration of IGD were also explored. IGD participants exhibited higher cue-induced activations within both the ventral and DS when compared with HCs. Within the IGD group, activity within the left ventral striatum (VS) was correlated negatively with cue-induced craving; positive associations were found between activations within the DS (right putamen, pallidum and left caudate) and duration of IGD. Cue-induced activity within the left putamen was negatively associated with right VS volumes among IGD participants. Consistent with studies in substance addictions, our results suggest that a transition from ventral to dorsal striatal processing may occur among individuals with IGD, a condition without the impact of substance intake.

pmid_15275919,Social and emotional attachment in the neural representation of faces.,,"To dissociate the role of visual familiarity from the role of social and emotional factors in recognizing familiar individuals, we measured neural activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while subjects viewed (1) faces of personally familiar individuals (i.e. friends and family), (2) faces of famous individuals, and (3) faces of strangers. Personally familiar faces evoked a stronger response than did famous familiar faces and unfamiliar faces in areas that have been associated with 'theory of mind', and a weaker response in the amygdala. These response modulations may reflect the spontaneous activation of social knowledge about the personality and attitudes of close friends and relatives and the less guarded attitude one has around these people. These results suggest that familiarity causes changes in neural response that extend beyond a visual memory for a face. ",
pmid_18560059,Cognitive control explored by linear modelling behaviour and fMRI data during Stroop tasks.,,"Most previous neuroimaging studies of Stroop paradigms have not provided sufficient information about the relationship between response times (RTs) and imaging signals. The objective of the present study is to build a linear model to explore the relationship between RTs and imaging signals. Neural information in Stroop tasks under the preconditions of high conflict and adjustment was extracted by using a method of modifying the ratio of congruent trials to incongruent trials in blocks. It was shown that the signals of the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) were negatively associated with the RTs for high-ratio trials in both blocks, and the signals of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) were negatively associated with the RTs for incongruence in high-conflict blocks. These results suggest that the DLPFC and ACC have more effects on executive modification and conflict monitoring, respectively. ",

These decisions are highly dependent on the context in which the alternatives are presented (e.g. labeling). We investigate the influence of cognition on food evaluation, using an fMRI experiment in which subjects saw and bid on different foods labeled with (or without) a widely known German emblem for organically produced food. Increased activity in the ventral striatum was found for foods labeled ""organic"" in comparison to conventionally labeled food. Between-subject differences in activity were related to actual everyday consumption behavior of organic food. ",

waiting list","Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) may be effective for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD); however, the neural mechanism is poorly understood. In this study, we examined the potential neural mechanisms through which MBCT may reduce anxiety in patients with mild-to-moderate GAD. Eight weekly group MBCT sessions (2 h each) were conducted with 32 GAD patients. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used, along with clinical and mindfulness profiles. A regional homogeneity (ReHo) approach was applied, and resting-state functional connectivity in the default mode network (DMN) using the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) seed was examined. MBCT reduced the anxiety and increased the mindfulness abilities of patients. After MBCT, patients had reduced ReHo in broad regions of the limbic system, along with increased DMN functional connectivity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and bilateral insula. Overlapping regions of reduced ReHo and increased DMN functional connectivity were observed in the mid-cingulate cortex (MCC) and bilateral insula. The increased PCC-ACC and PCC-insula functional connectivity following MBCT were related to anxiety improvements, suggesting a potential therapeutic mechanism for mindfulness-based therapies. Group MBCT treatment appears to have effectively reduced anxiety symptoms in patients with mild-to-moderate GAD. Activation and functional connectivity appeared significantly different across some limbic regions after MBCT treatment. The salience network showed reduced ReHo and increased connectivity to the PCC. The DMN functional connectivity of the MCC may indicate reduced anxiety and improved mindfulness in GAD patients. ",

We recruited 30 males with IGD and 30 controls and evaluated their gray matter density (GMD) and FC using resting fMRI. The severities of IGD, gaming urge, and impulsivity were also assessed. The results demonstrated that the subjects with IGD had a higher impulsivity and a greater severity of IGD. The subjects with IGD had a lower GMD over the bilateral amygdala than the controls. Further, the subjects with IGD had lower FC with the left amygdala over the left dorsolateral prefrontal lobe (DLPFC) and with the right amygdala over the left DLPFC and orbital frontal lobe (OFL). They also had higher FC with the bilateral amygdala over the contralateral insula than the controls. The FC between the left amygdala and DLPFC was negatively correlated with impulsivity. The FC of the right amygdala to the left DLPFC and orbital frontal lobe was also negatively correlated with impulsivity. Our results indicated that the altered GMD over the amygdala might represent vulnerability to IGD, such as impulsivity. Further analysis of the amygdala demonstrated impaired FC to the frontal lobe, which represents impulsivity. The results of this study suggested that the amygdala plays a very influential role in the mechanism of IGD. Its detailed role should be further evaluated in future study and should be considered in the treatment of IGD. ",

Type 2 diabetes","To investigate whether global spontaneous brain activity changes in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients and these changes vary according to the degree of microangiopathy. T2DM patients with (M(+), n=26) and without (M(-), n=22) microangiopathy as well as 28 healthy nondiabetic subjects were enrolled in this study. All the subjects completed a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) examination and neuropsychological assessment. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) values, representing spontaneous brain activity, were calculated and compared between M(+) and M(-) T2DM patients and nondiabetic controls. In both M(+) and M(-) T2DM patients, ReHo values were decreased in the occipital lobe, temporal lobe, postcentral gyrus, and cerebellum, while increased in the bilateral precuneus, superior/middle frontal gyrus, and insula. Compared with the M(-) group, M(+) patients showed decreased ReHo values in the left cuneus and superior occipital gyrus. The ReHo values in the lingual gyrus/calcarine cortex and MTG were related to clinical parameters in T2DM patients. The abnormalities of spontaneous brain activity revealed by ReHo values in both M(+)and M(-) T2DM patients may provide insights into the neurological pathophysiology underlying diabetes-related cognitive impairments. M(+) patients showed more decreased brain activity related to severely impaired function of visual processing and visual memory. ",

reasoning","For ∼40 years, thinking about reasoning has been dominated by dual-process theories. This model, consisting of two distinct types of human reasoning, one fast and effortless and the other slow and deliberate, has also been applied to medical diagnosis. Medical experts are trained to diagnose patients based on their symptoms. When symptoms are prototypical for a certain diagnosis, practitioners may rely on fast, recognition-based reasoning. However, if they are confronted with ambiguous clinical information slower, analytical reasoning is required. To examine the neural underpinnings of these two hypothesized forms of reasoning, 16 highly experienced clinical neurologists were asked to diagnose two types of medical cases, straightforward and ambiguous cases, while functional magnetic resonance imaging was being recorded. Compared with reading control sentences, diagnosing cases resulted in increased activation in brain areas typically found to be active during reasoning such as the caudate nucleus and frontal and parietal cortical regions. In addition, we found vast increased activity in the cerebellum. Regarding the activation differences between the two types of reasoning, no pronounced differences were observed in terms of regional activation. Notable differences were observed, though, in functional connectivity: cases containing ambiguous information showed stronger connectivity between specific regions in the frontal, parietal and temporal cortex in addition to the cerebellum. Based on these results, we propose that the higher demands in terms of controlled cognitive processing during analytical medical reasoning may be subserved by stronger communication between key regions for detecting and resolving uncertainty.

tract-based spatial statistics","Exploring white matter (WM) microstructural alterations is a momentous step for gaining insights about underlying mechanisms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and improving the efficacy of therapies for this condition. Many tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) studies have revealed abnormalities of fractional anisotropy (FA; an index of WM integrity) in OCD. However, research works have not drawn robust conclusions. Therefore, we integrated the findings of TBSS studies to identify the most consistent FA changes in OCD using meta-analytical approach. Online databases were systematically searched for all TBSS studies comparing FA between patients with OCD and controls. A coordinate-based meta-analysis was performed using anisotropic effect size version of the seed-based d mapping software. Meanwhile, meta-regression was used to explore the potential association of clinical characteristics with regional FA abnormalities. Our meta-analysis included 488 OCD patients and 519 controls across 17 datasets. FA reductions were identified in the genu of the corpus callosum and the left orbitofrontal WM in OCD patients relative to controls. Metaregression analyses showed that the FA in the left orbitofrontal WM was negatively and independently correlated with symptom severity and illness duration in patients with OCD. The current study provides a quantitative overview of TBSS findings in OCD and demonstrates the most prominent and replicable WM abnormalities in OCD are in the anterior part of the brain including interhemispheric connection and orbitofrontal region. Additionally, our findings suggest that FA reduction in the orbitofrontal WM might be a potential biomarker in predicting disease severity and progression in patients with OCD. ",
pmid_16949303,"Inhibition and generation of saccades: rapid event-related fMRI of prosaccades, antisaccades, and nogo trials.",,"Flexible, adaptive behavior often requires the inhibition of automatic responses in favor of voluntary response generation. The antisaccade task requires active inhibition of the automatic saccade to a peripheral stimulus followed by generation of a voluntary antisaccade to the opposite location. Previous studies demonstrated greater functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation for antisaccades than prosaccades in cortical saccade areas but did not distinguish the relative contributions of saccadic inhibition and generation. To address this question, we compared prosaccades, antisaccades, and nogo trials in a rapid event-related fMRI experiment with ten human subjects (6 female, 4 male). Trials were compound, containing a colored fixation point to cue trial type, followed by a 200-ms gap and then peripheral stimulus presentation and response. Required responses for prosaccade, antisaccade, and nogo trials, respectively, were to generate a saccade to the stimulus, look away from it, and inhibit the automatic saccade while maintaining central fixation. Frontal and supplementary eye fields, anterior cingulate cortex, intraparietal sulcus, and precuneus, exhibited surprisingly similar activation patterns for prosaccade and nogo responses, suggesting that BOLD signal in cortical saccade regions might predominantly reflect visual detection and attention processes rather than saccade generation or inhibition. These regions displayed greater activation for antisaccade responses versus prosaccade or nogo responses, possibly due to visuospatial remapping or increased attention levels in the antisaccade task. In right superior frontal sulcus, right supramarginal gyrus, and posterior cingulate sulcus, activation was greater for nogo compared to prosaccade responses, suggesting a role in active saccadic inhibition.

pmid_19353225,Decreased brain activation to tongue movements in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with bulbar involvement but not Kennedy syndrome.,,"Neuroimaging studies in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) investigating movements of the hands have in general found increased activation compared to healthy controls, which has been interpreted in terms of cortical adaptation as a result of corticospinal tract damage. Here, we investigated brain activations to vertical tongue movements using functional MRI at 3 tesla. Whereas healthy controls, patients with Kennedy syndrome, and ALS patients without bulbar involvement showed robust and indistinguishable activations in pre- and postcentral areas and the thalamus, ALS patients with bulbar involvement showed a significant decrease of cortical activity and missing thalamic activity. This decrease stands in marked contrast to the increase of activity observed in ALS patients when performing limb movements. We discuss these divergent findings with regard to the different physiological properties of tongue and limb movements. These findings may also help to explain the faster time-course of the disease in patients with bulbar involvement. ",

In the present study, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) combined with a gambling task, we examined the neural signatures of the money illusion in both win and loss domains. Behavioral results showed that self-reported satisfaction with outcomes was modulated by the face value but not the true value of money in both win and loss domains. At the neural level, activity in the posterior insula was associated with the true value of money in the win domain, but not in the loss domain. Importantly, we found that the ventral striatum, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and amygdala encoded the money illusion in both domains, indicating a domain-general rather than domain-specific neural signature. Moreover, participants with a larger degree of money illusion at the behavioral level showed stronger functional connectivity between the ventral striatum and ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) in the win domain, but stronger functional connectivity between the ventral striatum and amygdala in the loss domain. Our findings highlight the overlapping and distinct neural substrates underlying the money illusion in the context of wins and losses. ",

The present study aimed to examine whether baseline putamen activity can predict individual treatment response in schizophrenia. Two independent samples of patients with drug-naive, first-episode schizophrenia (32 patients in sample 1 and 44 in sample 2) and matched healthy controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at baseline. Patients were treated with olanzapine for 8 weeks; symptom severity was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) at baseline and week 8. Fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (fALFF) and pattern classification techniques were used to analyze the data. Univariate analysis shows an elevated pre-treatment fALFF in the left ventromedial putamen in both patient samples compared to healthy controls (p's < 0.001). The support vector regression (SVR) analysis suggests a positive relationship between baseline pre-treatment fALFF in the left ventromedial putamen and improvement in positive symptom at week 8 in each patient group using a cross-validated method (r = 0.452, p = .002; r = 0.511, p = .003, respectively). Our study suggests that elevated pre-treatment mean fALFF in the left ventromedial putamen may predict individual therapeutic response to olanzapine treatment in drug-naive, first-episode patients with schizophrenia. Future studies are needed to confirm whether this finding is generalizable to patients with schizophrenia treated with other antipsychotic medications.

self-referential processing","Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), an effective treatment for depression, targets self-referential processing of emotional stimuli. We examined the effects of CBT on brain functioning during self-referential processing in depressive patients using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Depressive patients (n = 23) and healthy participants (n = 15) underwent fMRI scans during a self-referential task using emotional trait words. The depressive patients had fMRI scans before and after completing a total of 12 weekly sessions of group CBT for depression, whereas the healthy participants underwent fMRI scans 12 weeks apart with no intervention. Before undergoing CBT, the depressive patients showed hyperactivity in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) during self-referential processing of negative words. Following CBT, MPFC and ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) activity during self-referential processing among depressive patients was increased for positive stimuli, whereas it was decreased for negative stimuli. Improvements in depressive symptoms were negatively correlated with vACC activity during self-referential processing of negative stimuli. These results suggest that CBT-related improvements in depressive symptoms are associated with changes in MPFC and vACC activation during self-referential processing of emotional stimuli. ",
pmid_20141305,Effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on emotion regulation in social anxiety disorder.,,"Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is an established program shown to reduce symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. MBSR is believed to alter emotional responding by modifying cognitive-affective processes. Given that social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by emotional and attentional biases as well as distorted negative self-beliefs, we examined MBSR-related changes in the brain-behavior indices of emotional reactivity and regulation of negative self-beliefs in patients with SAD. Sixteen patients underwent functional MRI while reacting to negative self-beliefs and while regulating negative emotions using 2 types of attention deployment emotion regulation-breath-focused attention and distraction-focused attention. Post-MBSR, 14 patients completed neuroimaging assessments. Compared with baseline, MBSR completers showed improvement in anxiety and depression symptoms and self-esteem. During the breath-focused attention task (but not the distraction-focused attention task), they also showed (a) decreased negative emotion experience, (b) reduced amygdala activity, and (c) increased activity in brain regions implicated in attentional deployment. MBSR training in patients with SAD may reduce emotional reactivity while enhancing emotion regulation. These changes might facilitate reduction in SAD-related avoidance behaviors, clinical symptoms, and automatic emotional reactivity to negative self-beliefs in adults with SAD. ",

In this fMRI study, we investigate whether creative cognition can be enhanced through idea sharing and how performance improvements are reflected in brain activity. Thirty-one participants had to generate alternative uses of everyday objects during fMRI recording. Additionally, participants performed this task after a time period in which they had to reflect on their ideas or in which they were confronted with stimulus-related ideas of others. Cognitive stimulation was effective in improving originality, and this performance improvement was associated with activation increases in a neural network including right-hemispheric temporo-parietal, medial frontal, and posterior cingulate cortices, bilaterally. Given the involvement of these brain areas in semantic integration, memory retrieval, and attentional processes, cognitive stimulation could have resulted in a modulation of bottom-up attention enabling participants to produce more original ideas.

schizophrenia","Schizophrenia is conceived as a disconnection syndrome and anatomical distance may affect functional connectivity (FC) in schizophrenia patients. However, whether and how anatomical distance affects FC remains unclear in first-episode, medication-naive schizophrenia at rest. Forty-nine schizophrenia patients and 50 age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning. Regional FC strength was computed for each voxel in the brain, which was further divided into short-range and long-range FC strength. The patients exhibited increased short-range positive FC strength in the left superior medial frontal gyrus, and increased long-range positive FC strength in the right angular gyrus and bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus compared with the controls. Further seed-based FC analysis showed that the left superior medial frontal gyrus had increased short-range FC with the right inferior frontal gyrus, while the right angular gyrus and bilateral PCC/precuneus had increased long-range FC with the prefrontal gyrus. No significant correlation was observed between abnormal FC strength and clinical variables in the patient group. The findings reveal a pattern of increased anatomical distance affecting FC in the patients, with the results of increased short-range positive FC strength in the anterior default-mode network (DMN) and increased long-range positive FC strength in the posterior DMN in schizophrenia, and highlight the importance of the DMN in the neurobiology of schizophrenia.

pmid_14523069,Differential cortical and subcortical activations in learning rotations and gains for reaching: a PET study.,,"Previous studies suggest that horizontal reaching movements are planned vectorially with independent specification of direction and extent. The transformation from visual to hand-centered coordinates requires the learning of a task-specific reference frame and scaling factor. We studied learning of a novel reference frame by imposing a screen-cursor rotation and learning of a scaling factor by imposing a novel gain. Previous work demonstrates that rotation and gain learning have different time courses and patterns of generalization. Here we used PET to identify and compare brain areas activated during rotation and gain learning, with a baseline motor-execution task as the subtracted control. Previous work has shown that the time courses of rotation and gain adaptation have a short rapid phase followed by a longer slow phase. We therefore also sought to compare activations associated with the rapid and slower phases of adaptation. We isolated the rapid phase by alternating opposite values of the rotation or gain every 16 movements. The rapid phase of rotation adaptation activated the preSMA. More complete adaptation to the rotation activated right ventral premotor cortex, right posterior parietal cortex, and the left lateral cerebellum. The rapid phase of gain learning only activated subcortical structures: bilateral putamen and left cerebellum. More complete gain learning failed to show any significant activation. We conclude that the time course of rotation adaptation is paralleled by a frontoparietal shift in activated cortical regions. In contrast, early gain adaptation involves only subcortical structures, which we suggest reflects a more automatic process of contextual recalibration of a scaling factor. ",
pmid_21134014,Neural correlates of verbal learning in adolescent alcohol and marijuana users.,,"Alcohol and marijuana are the most widely used intoxicants among adolescents, yet their potential unique and interactive influences on the developing brain are not well established. Brain regions subserving learning and memory undergo continued maturation during adolescence, and may be particularly susceptible to substance-related neurotoxic damage. In this study, we characterize brain response during verbal learning among adolescent users of alcohol and marijuana. Participants performed a verbal paired associates encoding task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. Adolescent subjects were recruited from local public schools and imaged at a university-based fMRI center. Participants were 74 16-18-year-olds, divided into four groups: (i) 22 controls with limited alcohol and marijuana experience, (ii) 16 binge drinkers, (iii) eight marijuana users and (iv) 28 binge drinking marijuana users. Diagnostic interview ensured that all teens were free from neurological or psychiatric disorders; urine toxicology and breathalyzer verified abstinence for 22-28 days before scanning; a verbal paired associates task was administered during fMRI. Groups demonstrated no differences in performance on the verbal encoding task, yet exhibited different brain response patterns. A main effect of drinking pointed to decreased inferior frontal but increased dorsal frontal and parietal fMRI response among binge drinkers (corrected P < 0.05). There was no main effect of marijuana use. Binge drinking × marijuana interactions were found in bilateral frontal regions (corrected P < 0.05), where users of either alcohol or marijuana showed greater response than non-users, but users of both substances resembled non-users. Adolescent substance users demonstrated altered fMRI response relative to non-using controls, yet binge drinking appeared to be associated with more differences in activation than marijuana use. Alcohol and marijuana may have interactive effects that alter these differences, particularly in prefrontal brain regions. ",
pmid_16473024,Changes in hippocampal connectivity in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease: evidence from resting state fMRI.,,"A selective distribution of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathological lesions in specific cortical layers isolates the hippocampus from the rest of the brain. However, functional connectivity between the hippocampus and other brain regions remains unclear in AD. Here, we employ a resting state functional MRI (fMRI) to examine changes in hippocampal connectivity comparing 13 patients with mild AD versus 13 healthy age-matched controls. Hippocampal connectivity was investigated by examination of the correlation between low frequency fMRI signal fluctuations in the hippocampus and those in all other brain regions. We found that functional connectivity between the right hippocampus and a set of regions was disrupted in AD; these regions are: medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), right inferotemporal cortex, right cuneus extending into precuneus, left cuneus, right superior and middle temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). We also found increased functional connectivity between the left hippocampus and the right lateral prefrontal cortex in AD. In addition, rightward asymmetry of hippocampal connectivity observed in elderly controls was diminished in AD patients. The disrupted hippocampal connectivity to the MPFC, vACC and PCC provides further support for decreased activity in ""default mode network"" previously shown in AD. The decreased connectivity between the hippocampus and the visual cortices might indicate reduced integrity of hippocampus-related cortical networks in AD. Moreover, these findings suggest that resting-state fMRI might be an appropriate approach for studying pathophysiological changes in early AD. ",
pmid_19416664,Changes of resting state brain networks in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,,"The defining feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons but extramotor involvement, evidenced for example by executive dysfunction, has also been demonstrated. Here we employed a novel functional imaging approach, the analysis of resting state activity, followed by the definition of functionally connected brain networks by independent component analysis (ICA) to assess differences between ALS patients (n=20) and healthy controls (n=20). ICA analysis revealed 5 typical brain networks among which the so-called default mode network and the sensori-motor network showed distinct differences between patients and controls. The default mode network showed less activation in patients in several regions including the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and the left and right inferior parietal cortex, regions that have been linked previously to executive functions. The sensori-motor network showed group differences in the premotor cortex. We propose that resting state analysis affords a new and simple means to assess disease-related neurofunctional alterations in widespread brain networks. A decisive advantage is that no task is demanded from the subjects and, thus, the problem of differential task difficulty and effort between groups is circumvented. ",

Superior temporal sulcus","Posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) is specialized for interpreting perceived human actions, and disruptions to its function occur in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Here we consider the role of Crus I of neocerebellum in supporting pSTS function. Research has associated Crus I activity with imitation and biological motion perception, and neocerebellum is theorized to coordinate activity among cerebral sites more generally. Moreover, cerebellar abnormalities have been associated with ASD. We hypothesized that disordered Crus I-pSTS interactions could predict social deficits in ASD. 15 high functioning adolescents with ASD and 15 same-age comparison youth participated in an fMRI imitation paradigm; ratings of mentalizing ability were collected via parent report. We predicted that stronger Crus I-pSTS interactions would be associated with better mentalizing ability. Consistent with these hypotheses, stronger psychophysiological interactions between Crus I and right pSTS were associated with greater mentalizing ability among adolescents with ASD. Whole-brain analyses also indicated that typically developing youth recruited right inferior frontal gyrus, left pSTS, medial occipital regions, and precuneus more strongly during imitation than did youth with ASD. Overall, these results indicate that variability in neocerebellar interactions with key cortical social brain sites may help explain individual differences in social perceptual outcomes in ASD. ",

striatum","Pathological gambling is an addictive disorder characterized by a persistent and compulsive desire to engage in gambling activities. This maladaptive behaviour has been suggested to result from a decreased sensitivity to experienced rewards, regardless of reward type. Alternatively, pathological gambling might reflect an imbalance in the sensitivity to monetary versus non-monetary incentives. To directly test these two hypotheses, we examined how the brain reward circuit of pathological gamblers responds to different types of rewards. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we compared the brain responses of 18 pathological gamblers and 20 healthy control subjects while they engaged in a simple incentive task manipulating both monetary and visual erotic rewards. During reward anticipation, the ventral striatum of pathological gamblers showed a differential response to monetary versus erotic cues, essentially driven by a blunted reactivity to cues predicting erotic stimuli. This differential response correlated with the severity of gambling symptoms and was paralleled by a reduced behavioural motivation for erotic rewards. During reward outcome, a posterior orbitofrontal cortex region, responding to erotic rewards in both groups, was further recruited by monetary gains in pathological gamblers but not in control subjects. Moreover, while ventral striatal activity correlated with subjective ratings assigned to monetary and erotic rewards in control subjects, it only correlated with erotic ratings in gamblers. Our results point to a differential sensitivity to monetary versus non-monetary rewards in pathological gambling, both at the motivational and hedonic levels. Such an imbalance might create a bias towards monetary rewards, potentially promoting addictive gambling behaviour. ",
pmid_15588615,A direct brainstem-amygdala-cortical 'alarm' system for subliminal signals of fear.,,"We examined whether consciously undetected fear signals engage a collateral brainstem pathway to the amygdala and prefrontal cortex in the intact human brain, using functional neuroimaging. 'Blindsight' lesion patients can respond to visual fear signals independently from conscious experience, suggesting that these signals reach the amygdala via a direct pathway that bypasses the primary visual cortex. Electrophysiological evidence points to concomitant involvement of prefrontal regions in automatic orienting to subliminal signals of fear, which may reflect innervation arising from brainstem arousal systems. To approximate blindsight in 22 healthy subjects, facial signals of fear were presented briefly (16.7 ms) and masked such that conscious detection was prevented. Results revealed that subliminal fear signals elicited activity in the brainstem region encompassing the superior colliculus and locus coeruleus, pulvinar and amygdala, and in fronto-temporal regions associated with orienting. These findings suggest that crude sensory input from the superior colliculo-pulvinar visual pathway to the amygdala may allow for sufficient appraisal of fear signals to innervate the locus coeruleus. The engagement of the locus coeruleus could explain the observation of diffuse fronto-temporal cortical activity, given its role in evoking collateral ascending noradrenergic efferents to the subcortical amygdala and prefrontal cortex. This network may represent an evolutionary adaptive neural 'alarm' system for rapid alerting to sources of threat, without the need for conscious appraisal. ",

This study replicated the previous results of culture-familiar music effect on Chinese subjects: the greater P300 amplitude in frontal areas in a culture-familiar music environment. At the same time, the difference between guqin music and piano music was observed in N1 and later positive complex (LPC: including P300 and P500): a relatively higher participation of right anterior-temporal areas in Chinese subjects. The results suggest that the special features of ERP responses to guqin music are the outcome of Chinese tonal language environments given the similarity between Guqinos tones and Mandarin lexical tones.

Recently activated macrophages were found to be a source of AGEs, and the most abundant form of AGEs, AGE-albumin excreted by macrophages has been implicated in these diseases and to act through common pathways. AGEs inhibition has been shown to prevent the pathogenesis of AGEs-related diseases in human, and therapeutic advances have resulted in several agents that prevent their adverse effects. Recently, anti-inflammatory molecules that inhibit AGEs have been shown to be good candidates for ameliorating diabetic complications as well as degenerative diseases. This review was undertaken to present, discuss, and clarify current understanding regarding AGEs formation in association with macrophages, different diseases, therapeutic and diagnostic strategy and links with RAGE inhibition.

pmid_20840335,"Brain activation patterns associated with cue reactivity and craving in abstinent problem gamblers, heavy smokers and healthy controls: an fMRI study.",,"Abnormal cue reactivity is a central characteristic of addiction, associated with increased activity in motivation, attention and memory related brain circuits. In this neuroimaging study, cue reactivity in problem gamblers (PRG) was compared with cue reactivity in heavy smokers (HSM) and healthy controls (HC). A functional magnetic resonance imaging event-related cue reactivity paradigm, consisting of gambling, smoking-related and neutral pictures, was employed in 17 treatment-seeking non-smoking PRG, 18 non-gambling HSM, and 17 non-gambling and non-smoking HC. Watching gambling pictures (relative to neutral pictures) was associated with higher brain activation in occipitotemporal areas, posterior cingulate cortex, parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala in PRG compared with HC and HSM. Subjective craving in PRG correlated positively with brain activation in left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and left insula. When comparing the HSM group with the two other groups, no significant differences in brain activity induced by smoking cues were found. In a stratified analysis, the HSM subgroup with higher Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence scores (FTND M = 5.4) showed higher brain activation in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, rostral anterior cingulate cortex, insula and middle/superior temporal gyrus while watching smoking-related pictures (relative to neutral pictures) than the HSM subgroup with lower FTND scores (FTND M = 2.9) and than non-smoking HC. Nicotine craving correlated with activation in left prefrontal and left amygdala when viewing smoking-related pictures in HSM. Increased regional responsiveness to gambling pictures in brain regions linked to motivation and visual processing is present in PRG, similar to neural mechanisms underlying cue reactivity in substance dependence. Increased brain activation in related fronto-limbic brain areas was present in HSM with higher FTND scores compared with HSM with lower FTND scores. ",
pmid_16797608,Neural systems for recognition of familiar faces.,,"Immediate access to information about people that we encounter is an essential requirement for effective social interactions. In this manuscript we briefly review our work and work of others on familiar face recognition and propose a modified version of our model of neural systems for face perception with a special emphasis on processes associated with recognition of familiar faces. We argue that visual appearance is only one component of successful recognition of familiar individuals. Other fundamental aspects include the retrieval of ""person knowledge"" - the representation of the personal traits, intentions, and outlook of someone we know - and the emotional response we experience when seeing a familiar individual. Specifically, we hypothesize that the ""theory of mind"" areas, that have been implicated in social and cognitive functions other than face perception, play an essential role in the spontaneous activation of person knowledge associated with the recognition of familiar individuals. The amygdala and the insula, structures that are involved in the representation of emotion, also are part of the distributed network of areas that are modulated by familiarity, reflecting the role of emotion in face recognition.

pmid_17214564,Activation of right inferior frontal gyrus during response inhibition across response modalities.,,"The go/no-go task, which effectively taps the ability to inhibit prepotent response tendency, has consistently activated the lateral prefrontal cortex, particularly the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG). On the other hand, rIFG activation has rarely been reported in the antisaccade task, seemingly an oculomotor version of the manual go/no-go task. One possible explanation for the variable IFG activation is the modality difference of the two tasks: The go/no-go task is performed manually, whereas the antisaccade task is performed in the oculomotor modality. Another explanation is that these two tasks have different task structures that require different cognitive processes: The traditional antisaccade task requires (i) configuration of a preparatory set prior to antisaccade execution and (ii) response inhibition at the time of antisaccade execution, whereas the go/no-go task requires heightened response inhibition under a minimal preparatory set. To test these possibilities, the traditional antisaccade task was modified in the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study such that it required heightened response inhibition at the time of antisaccade execution under a minimal preparatory set. Prominent activation related to response inhibition was observed in multiple frontoparietal regions, including the rIFG. Moreover, meta-analyses revealed that the rIFG activation in the present study was observed in the go/no-go tasks but not in the traditional antisaccade task, indicating that the rIFG activation was sensitive to the task structure difference, but not to the response modality difference. These results suggest that the rIFG is part of a network active during response inhibition across different response modalities. ",
pmid_19490045,"Evaluation of cognition, structural, and functional MRI in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.",,"Previous studies using advanced imaging techniques have suggested subtle structural and functional changes in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), mainly associated with the frontal lobes. In addition, it has been reported that these patients show neuropsychological deficits, often summarized as frontal lobe dysfunction. The aim of this study was a comprehensive analysis of neuropsychological parameters, and functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in an independent cohort of patients with JME. We studied 19 JME patients and 20 age-, sex-, and education-matched controls using a battery of standardized neuropsychological tests, optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM), and two domain-specific working-memory paradigms combined with functional MRI (fMRI). Our investigations did not reveal statistically significant differences between the groups of JME patients and normal controls in either the VBM or the fMRI study of working memory. The neuropsychological examination showed a slightly worse performance for the JME patients across most tests used, reaching statistical significance for semantic and verbal fluency. In our cohort of JME patients, we could not reproduce the findings of frontal gray matter changes from previous studies, and we could not detect an fMRI correlate of previously reported differences in working memory in JME. The neuropsychological deficits may be attributed partially to antiepileptic medication. We conclude that structural and functional frontal lobe deficits in JME patients have to be interpreted with care. One reason for a variation between different cohorts may be the genetic heterogeneity of the disease. ",
pmid_25876179,Neural coding within human brain areas involved in actions.,,"Many earlier human functional MRI (fMRI) studies that investigated the neural circuits involved in sensorimotor control were motivated by previous non-human primate (NHP) work and focused on the specialization of brain areas for particular actions like reaching, grasping and eye movements. More recently, newer, more sensitive analysis techniques have enabled researchers to move beyond this simple functional mapping approach and begin exploring a wide range of novel research questions in humans that have not been well addressed in NHPs. This work, which we review here, reveals that action-related information is coded across a much broader range of brain regions than expected from earlier studies and offers new insights into the highly distributed hierarchical neural architecture that supports human goal-directed behavior.

pmid_15716371,Distinguishable brain activation networks for short- and long-term motor skill learning.,,"The acquisition of a new motor skill is characterized first by a short-term, fast learning stage in which performance improves rapidly, and subsequently by a long-term, slower learning stage in which additional performance gains are incremental. Previous functional imaging studies have suggested that distinct brain networks mediate these two stages of learning, but direct comparisons using the same task have not been performed. Here we used a task in which subjects learn to track a continuous 8-s sequence demanding variable isometric force development between the fingers and thumb of the dominant, right hand. Learning-associated changes in brain activation were characterized using functional MRI (fMRI) during short-term learning of a novel sequence, during short-term learning after prior, brief exposure to the sequence, and over long-term (3 wk) training in the task. Short-term learning was associated with decreases in activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal, anterior cingulate, posterior parietal, primary motor, and cerebellar cortex, and with increased activation in the right cerebellar dentate nucleus, the left putamen, and left thalamus. Prefrontal, parietal, and cerebellar cortical changes were not apparent with short-term learning after prior exposure to the sequence. With long-term learning, increases in activity were found in the left primary somatosensory and motor cortex and in the right putamen. Our observations extend previous work suggesting that distinguishable networks are recruited during the different phases of motor learning. While short-term motor skill learning seems associated primarily with activation in a cortical network specific for the learned movements, long-term learning involves increased activation of a bihemispheric cortical-subcortical network in a pattern suggesting ""plastic"" development of new representations for both motor output and somatosensory afferent information.

pmid_15691521,Neural substrates for voluntary suppression of negative affect: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study.,,"Successful control of affect partly depends on the capacity to modulate negative emotional responses through the use of cognitive strategies. Although the capacity to regulate emotions is critical to mental well-being, its neural substrates remain unclear. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to ascertain brain regions involved in the voluntary regulation of emotion and whether dynamic changes in negative emotional experience can modulate their activation. Fourteen healthy subjects were scanned while they either maintained the negative affect evoked by highly arousing and aversive pictures (e.g., experience naturally) or suppressed their affect using cognitive reappraisal. In addition to a condition-based analysis, online subjective ratings of intensity of negative affect were used as covariates of brain activity. Inhibition of negative affect was associated with activation of dorsal anterior cingulate, dorsal medial prefrontal, and lateral prefrontal cortices, and attenuation of brain activity within limbic regions (e.g., nucleus accumbens/extended amygdala). Furthermore, activity within dorsal anterior cingulate was inversely related to intensity of negative affect, whereas activation of the amygdala was positively covaried with increasing negative affect. These findings highlight a functional dissociation of corticolimbic brain responses, involving enhanced activation of prefrontal cortex and attenuation of limbic areas, during volitional suppression of negative emotion.

pmid_29426874,Oxytocin curbs calorie intake via food-specific increases in the activity of brain areas that process reward and establish cognitive control.,,"The hypothalamic neurohormone oxytocin decreases food intake via largely unexplored mechanisms. We investigated the central nervous mediation of oxytocin's hypophagic effect in comparison to its impact on the processing of generalized rewards. Fifteen fasted normal-weight, young men received intranasal oxytocin (24 IU) or placebo before functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements of brain activity during exposure to food stimuli and a monetary incentive delay task (MID). Subsequently, ad-libitum breakfast intake was assessed. Oxytocin compared to placebo increased activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area, anterior cingulate, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices in response to high- vs. low-calorie food images in the fasted state, and reduced calorie intake by 12%. During anticipation of monetary rewards, oxytocin compared to placebo augmented striatal, orbitofrontal and insular activity without altering MID performance. We conclude that during the anticipation of generalized rewards, oxytocin stimulates dopaminergic reward-processing circuits. In contrast, oxytocin restrains food intake by enhancing the activity of brain regions that exert cognitive control, while concomitantly increasing the activity of structures that process food reward value. This pattern points towards a specific role of oxytocin in the regulation of eating behaviour in humans that might be of relevance for potential clinical applications. ",

The initial symptoms are very insidious at onset. We investigated the alterations in spontaneous brain activity and network connectivity through regional homogeneity (ReHo) and graph theoretical network analyses, respectively, of resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) in T2DM patients with and without MCI, so as to facilitate early diagnose. Twenty-five T2DM patients with MCI (DM-MCI), 25 T2DM patients with normal cognition (DM-NC), 27 healthy controls were enrolled. Whole-brain ReHo values were calculated and topological properties of functional networks were analyzed. The DM-MCI group exhibited decreased ReHo in the left inferior/middle occipital gyrus and right inferior temporal gyrus, and increased ReHo in frontal gyrus compared to the DM-NCs. Significant correlations were found between ReHo values and clinical measurements. The DM-MCI group illustrated greater clustering coefficient/local efficiency and altered nodal characteristics (efficiency, degree and betweenness), which increased in certain occipital, temporal and parietal regions but decreased in the right inferior temporal gyrus, compared to the DM-NCs. The altered ReHo and impaired network organization may underlie the impaired cognitive functions in T2DM and suggesting a compensation mechanism. These rs-fMRI measures have the potential as biomarkers of disease progression in diabetic encephalopathy. ",

Resting state fMRI scanning was performed on 10 clinically diagnosed aMCI patients and 10 healthy volunteers, and the difference in the resting-state brain activities between aMCI patients and healthy volunteers was compared using the brain function network regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis method. Results of the ReHo analysis of aMCI patients and healthy volunteers revealed that the ReHo value significantly increased in the posterior cingulate gyrus region, medial frontal lobe, medial cortex of the prefrontal lobe, and part of the parietal lobe. Compared with the normal elderlies, ReHo decreased in aMCI patients in the left temporal lobe (middle temporal gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus), left parahippocampal gyrus, occipital lobe, lingual gyrus, precuneus, and other regions while ReHo increased in regions of the right frontal lobe (inferior frontal gyrus), left superior temporal gyrus, precentral gyrus (frontal lobe), right thalamus, left fusiform gyrus, and other regions. In the resting state, there may be regional abnormalities in brain functional areas in aMCI patients, which may be associated with cognitive impairment. ",

Although electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is, along with antidepressants and psychotherapy, one of the three major treatments of depression, it is still considered as the last resort for depressed patients. This situation is partially due to limited studies and uncertainty regarding its mechanism. However, decades of increased research have focused on the effects of ECT on depression and its potential mechanism. Furthermore, these investigations may suggest that ECT should be a first-line therapy for depression due to its profound effects in relieving desperation in certain situations. Here, we outline recent clinical and preclinical studies and summarize the advantages and disadvantages of ECT. Thus, this review may provide some hints for clinical application. ",
pmid_22209784,Meta-analytical definition and functional connectivity of the human vestibular cortex.,,"Contrary to most other sensory systems, no consensus has been reached within the scientific community about the exact locations and functions of human cortical areas processing vestibular information. Metaanalytical modelling using activation likelihood estimation (ALE) for the integration of neuroimaging results has already been successfully applied to several distinct tasks, thereby revealing the cortical localization of cognitive functions. We used the same algorithm and technique with all available and suitable PET and fMRI studies employing a vestibular stimulus. Most consistently across 28 experiments vestibular stimuli evoked activity in the right hemispheric parietal opercular area OP 2 implicating it as the core region for vestibular processing. Furthermore, we took our primary results as a seeding point and fed them into a functional connectivity analysis based on resting-state oscillations in 100 healthy subjects. This subsequent calculation confirmed direct connections of the area OP 2 with every other region found in the meta-analysis, in particular temporo-parietal regions, premotor cortex, and the midcingulate gyrus. Thus revealing a joint vestibular network in accordance with a concept from animal literature termed the inner vestibular circle. Moreover, there was also a significant vestibular connectivity overlap with frontal but not parietal cortical centres responsible for the generation of saccadic eye movements, likely to be involved in nystagmus fast phase generation. This was shown in an additional ocular motor meta-analysis. We conclude that the cytoarchitectonic area OP 2 in the parietal operculum, embedded in a joint vestibular network, should be the primary candidate for the human vestibular cortex. This area may represent the human homologue to the vestibular area PIVC as proposed by Guldin and Grüsser in non-human primates. ",

We demonstrate that activity in the ventral striatum, an area heavily implicated in reward processing, tracked the degree of influence on participants' decisions arising from the observation of other peoples' decisions. The signal did not track non-human, non-social control decisions. These findings lend weight to the notion that the ventral striatum is involved in the processing of complex social aspects of decision making and identify a possible neural basis for herd behavior.

pmid_15541071,A functional MRI study of working memory task in euthymic bipolar disorder: evidence for task-specific dysfunction.,,"Even when euthymic bipolar disorder patients can have persistent deficits in working memory, but the neural basis of this deficit remains unclear. We undertook an functional magnetic resonance imaging investigation of euthymic bipolar disorder patients performing two working memory paradigms; the two-back and Sternberg tasks, selected to examine the central executive and the phonological loop respectively. We hypothesized that neuronal dysfunction would be specific to the network underlying the executive rather than the phonological loop component of working memory. Twelve right-handed euthymic bipolar I males receiving lithium carbonate monotherapy were matched with 12 controls. The two-back task comprised a single working memory load contrasted with baseline vigilance condition. The Sternberg paradigm used a parametric design incorporating variable working memory load with fixed delay between presentation of an array of items to be remembered and a target item. Functional activation data were acquired during performance of the tasks and were analysed to produce brain activation maps representing significant group differences in activation (ANOVA). Load-response curves were derived from the Sternberg task data set. There were no significant between-group differences (t-test) in performance of the two-back task, or in 2 x 5 group by memory load ANOVA for the performance data from Sternberg task. In the two-back task, compared with controls bipolar disorder patients showed reductions in bilateral frontal, temporal and parietal activation, and increased activations with the left precentral, right medial frontal and left supramarginal gyri. No between-group differences were observed in the Sternberg task at any working memory load. Our findings support the notion that, in euthymic bipolar disorder, failure to engage fronto-executive function underpins the core neuropsychological deficits. ",
pmid_23144849,Distinct contributions of the dorsolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex during emotion regulation.,,"The lateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices have both been implicated in emotion regulation, but their distinct roles in regulation of negative emotion remain poorly understood. To address this issue we enrolled 58 participants in an fMRI study in which participants were instructed to reappraise both negative and neutral stimuli. This design allowed us to separately study activations reflecting cognitive processes associated with reappraisal in general and activations specifically related to reappraisal of negative emotion. Our results confirmed that both the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) contribute to emotion regulation through reappraisal. However, activity in the DLPFC was related to reappraisal independently of whether negative or neutral stimuli were reappraised, whereas the lateral OFC was uniquely related to reappraisal of negative stimuli. We suggest that relative to the lateral OFC, the DLPFC serves a more general role in emotion regulation, perhaps by reflecting the cognitive demand that is inherent to the regulation task. ",
pmid_9869705,Neuroanatomical correlates of human reasoning.,,"One of the important questions cognitive theories of reasoning must address is whether logical reasoning is inherently sentential or spatial. A sentential model would exploit nonspatial (linguistic) properties of representations whereas a spatial model would exploit spatial properties of representations. In general terms, the linguistic hypothesis predicts that the language processing regions underwrite human reasoning processes, and the spatial hypothesis suggests that the neural structures for perception and motor control contribute the basic representational building blocks used for high-level logical and linguistic reasoning. We carried out a [(15)O] H(2)O PET imaging study to address this issue. Twelve normal volunteers performed three types of deductive reasoning tasks (categorical syllogisms, three-term spatial relational items, and three-term nonspatial relational items) while their regional cerebral blood flow pattern was recorded using [(15)O] H(2)O PET imaging. In the control condition subjects semantically comprehended sets of three sentences. In the deductive reasoning conditions subjects determined whether the third sentence was entailed by the first two sentences. The areas of activation in each reasoning condition were confined to the left hemisphere and were similar to each other and to activation reported in previous studies. They included the left inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 45, 47), a portion of the left middle frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 46), the left middle temporal gyrus (Brodmann areas 21, 22), a region of the left lateral inferior temporal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus (Brodmann areas 22, 37), and a portion of the left cingulate gyrus (Brodmann areas 32, 24). There was no significant right-hemisphere or parietal activation. These results are consistent with previous neuroimaging studies and raise questions about the level of involvement of classic spatial regions in reasoning about linguistically presented spatial relations.

Thalamus","Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease that produces changes in movement, cognition, sleep, and autonomic function. Motor learning involves acquisition of new motor skills through practice, and is affected by PD. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate regional differences in resting cerebral blood flow (rCBF), measured using arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI, during a finger-typing task of motor skill acquisition in PD patients compared to age- and gender-matched controls. Voxel-wise multiple linear regression models were used to examine the relationship between rCBF and several task variables, including initial speed, proficiency gain, and accuracy. In these models, a task-by-disease group interaction term was included to investigate where the relationship between rCBF and task performance was influenced by PD. At baseline, perfusion was lower in PD subjects than controls in the right occipital cortex. The task-by-disease group interaction for initial speed was significantly related to rCBF (p < 0.05, corrected) in several brain regions involved in motor learning, including the occipital, parietal, and temporal cortices, cerebellum, anterior cingulate, and the superior and middle frontal gyri. In these regions, PD patients showed higher rCBF, and controls lower rCBF, with improved performance. Within the control group, proficiency gain over 12 typing trials was related to greater rCBF in cerebellar, occipital, and temporal cortices. These results suggest that higher rCBF within networks involved in motor learning enable PD patients to compensate for disease-related deficits. ",
pmid_19129383,Personality predicts the brain's response to viewing appetizing foods: the neural basis of a risk factor for overeating.,,"Eating is not only triggered by hunger but also by the sight of foods. Viewing appetizing foods alone can induce food craving and eating, although there is considerable variation in this ""external food sensitivity"" (EFS). Because increased EFS is associated with overeating, identifying its neural correlates is important for understanding the current epidemic of obesity. Animal research has identified the ventral striatum, amygdala, hypothalamus, medial prefrontal and premotor cortices as key interacting structures for feeding. However, it is unclear whether a similar network exists in humans and how it is affected by EFS. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we showed that viewing appetizing compared with bland foods produced changes in connectivity among the human ventral striatum, amygdala, anterior cingulate and premotor cortex that were strongly correlated with EFS. Differences in the dynamic interactions within the human appetitive network in response to pictures of appetizing foods may determine an individual's risk of obesity. ",

Nineteen patients with diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy and 19 healthy controls (HCs) were matched for age and gender. Spontaneous cerebral activity variations were investigated using the ALFF technique. The average ALFF values of the DRN patients and the HCs were classified utilizing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. In contrast to the results in the HCs, the patients with DRN had significantly higher ALFF values in the cerebellum (bilaterally in the posterior and anterior lobes) and the left inferior temporal gyrus, but the ALFF values of the bilateral medial frontal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, left middle/inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral precuneus, and left inferior parietal lobule were lower. ROC curve analysis of each brain region showed the accuracy of AUC was excellent. However, the mean ALFF values in the different regions did not correlate with clinical performance. The subjects showed abnormal neuronal synchronization in many areas of the brain, which is consistent with cognitive and visual functional deficits. Abnormal spontaneous activity was detected in many areas of the brain, which may provide useful information for understanding the pathology of DRN. Abnormal ALFF values of these brain regions may be of predictive value in the development of early DRN and be a targeted intervention indicator for individualized treatment of diabetic microvascular diseases.

temporoparietal junction","The temporoparietal junction (TPJ) has been linked to lower-level attentional and higher-level social processing, both of which are affected in schizophrenia (SZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD). We examined resting functional connectivity of bilateral anterior and posterior TPJ in SZ and MDD to evaluate potential anomalies in each disorder and differences between disorders. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired from 24 patients with SZ, 24 patients with MDD, and 24 age-matched healthy controls. We performed seed-based functional connectivity analyses with seed regions in bilateral anterior and posterior TPJ, covarying for gender and smoking. SZ had reduced connectivity versus controls between left anterior TPJ and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC); between left posterior TPJ and middle cingulate cortex, left dorsal PFC, and right lateral PFC; between right anterior TPJ and bilateral PCC; and between right posterior TPJ and middle cingulate cortex, left posterior insula, and right insula. MDD had reduced connectivity versus controls between left posterior TPJ and right dlPFC and between right posterior TPJ and PCC and dlPFC. SZ had reduced connectivity versus MDD between right posterior TPJ and left fusiform gyrus and right superior-posterior temporal cortex. Functional connectivity to the TPJ was demonstrated to be disrupted in both SZ and MDD. However, TPJ connectivity may differ in these disorders with reduced connectivity in SZ versus MDD between TPJ and posterior brain regions. ",

Self-concept","MMORPG addiction has been associated with self-concept impairments and increased identification with the own avatar. Yet, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of self-identification with avatars, especially reflected in the left angular gyrus (AG), have only been assessed in regular gamers. Therefore, the study aims to examine neurobiological processes in addicted MMORPG players while evaluating their own and their personal avatar's body image (physical self-concept). Sixteen addicted and seventeen non-addicted gamers underwent functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) while viewing images of themselves, their own avatar and unfamiliar persons. The Body Image Questionnaire (FKB-20) and Visual Analog Scales (VAS) assessing the degree of attractiveness, sympathy and gender identity of the self, of the avatar as well as of the unfamiliar persons were applied. Addicts showed a significantly extended negative body image and lower gender identity levels as well as decreased bilateral brain activations in the AG and the middle occipital gyrus during self-perception. They further exhibited higher activations in the left AG during avatar-perception. Regression analyses in the overall group and in addicted gamers indicated a significant positive correlation between gender identity and brain activation in the left AG during self-perception. Our results confirm addicted MMORPG players to have physical self-concept deficits which may be related to hypoactivations in the AG. The findings further indicate addicted gamers to have a tendency to identify themselves easier with their own avatar than with their real self. Lower gender identity levels might be associated with physical self-concept deficits in MMORPG addiction. ",
pmid_16504223,Parietal updating of limb posture: an event-related fMRI study.,,"The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is thought to integrate different kinds of sensory information (e.g., visual, auditory, somatosensory) to produce multiple representations of space that are each associated with different types or combinations of action; such as saccadic eye movements and reaching or grasping movements of the upper limb. Lesion studies in monkeys and in humans have shown that reaching movements to visually defined and to posturally defined targets can be dissociated from one another; indicating that different regions of the parietal cortex may code the same movement in either extrinsic (visual) or intrinsic (postural) coordinates. These studies also suggest that regions within the posterior parietal cortex play an important role in maintaining an accurate and up-to-date representation of the current postural state of the body (the body schema). We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate those brain areas involved in maintaining and updating postural (i.e., non-visual) representations of the upper limb that participate in the accurate control of reaching movements. We show that a change in the posture of the upper-limb is associated with a significant increase in BOLD activation in only one brain region--the superior parietal cortex, particularly the medial aspect (precuneus). We note that this finding is consistent with the suggestion, based upon human neurological investigations and monkey electrophysiology, that this region of the PPC may participate in the dynamic representation of the body schema, and is the most likely location for damage leading to errors in visually guided reaching to non-foveated target locations. We also note that this brain area corresponds to a region of PPC recently identified as the human homologue of the Parietal Reach Region (PRR) observed in the monkey brain that has been thought to represent reaching movements in eye-centred coordinates.

pmid_26053309,Abnormal Intrinsic Brain Activity Patterns in Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease Undergoing Peritoneal Dialysis: A Resting-State Functional MR Imaging Study.,,"To analyze the spontaneous brain activity patterns in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) by using resting-state functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with an amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) algorithm. This study received institutional review board approval, and all subjects gave informed consent. Forty-four patients with ESRD, 24 of whom were undergoing PD (PD group; eight women; mean age, 34 years ± 8) and 20 who were not undergoing PD or hemodialysis (nondialysis group; six women; mean age, 37 years ± 9) and 24 healthy control subjects (eight women; mean age, 32 years ± 9 years) were included. All subjects underwent neuropsychologic tests, and patients with ESRD underwent laboratory testing. ALFF values were compared among the three groups. The relationship between ALFF values and clinical markers was investigated by using multiple regression analysis. Patients in both the PD and nondialysis groups showed lower ALFF values in default mode network regions than did healthy control subjects (P < .01, false discovery rate corrected). Patients in the PD group showed lower ALFF values than did those in the nondialysis group in the left superior parietal lobe (1.51 ± 0.21 vs 2.01 ± 0.40), left inferior parietal lobe (0.99 ± 0.16 vs 1.13 ± 0.22) and left precuneus (1.45 ± 0.39 vs 1.77 ± 0.41) (P < .01, corrected with simulation software). In patients in the PD group, neuropsychologic test scores correlated with ALFF values of the middle temporal gyrus and the parietal and occipital lobe, serum urea and creatinine levels negatively correlated with ALFF in some default mode network regions, and hemoglobin positively correlated with ALFF in the bilateral precuneus, precentral, and supplementary motor areas (P < .01 corrected). Patients with ESRD who were undergoing PD showed more severe spontaneous brain activity abnormalities that correlate with cognitive impairments than did patients who were not undergoing dialysis. Elevated serum urea, creatinine, and lowered hemoglobin levels affect spontaneous brain activity in patients with ESRD. ",
pmid_17473838,The formation of abnormal associations in schizophrenia: neural and behavioral evidence.,,"It is hypothesized that due to an abnormal functioning of the reward system patients with schizophrenia form context-inappropriate associations. It has been shown that the dopamine target regions, especially the ventral striatum, are critical in the formation of reward associations. We wanted to examine how the ventral striatum responds as patients learn reward-related associations and how this neural response is linked to objective and subjective behavioral measures. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses were examined using aversive Pavlovian learning in 13 medicated patients with schizophrenia and 13 matched healthy controls. Colored circles served as conditioned stimulus (CS+) while a loud, individually adjusted, noise served as the unconditioned stimulus. Circles of another color served as neutral comparators (CS-). Subjective indices were assessed by a post-scan self-report, and galvanic skin responses (GSR) were used as objective measures of associative learning. fMRI data were analyzed using a random effects model in SPM2. Patients showed inappropriately strong activations in the ventral striatum in response to the neutral stimulus (CS-) as compared to the healthy controls. Consistent with this neural evidence of aberrant learning, patients also showed evidence of abnormal learning by self-report and as indexed by GSR. The main finding here is that patients with schizophrenia, when exposed to neutral stimuli in a threatening situation, show an abnormal pattern of learning. The aberrant activations and response are consistent with the idea that patients aberrantly assign motivational salience to neutral stimuli, and this process may be one of the aberrations that predisposes them to psychosis.

pmid_20085788,Alteration of resting brain function by genetic variation in angiotensin converting enzyme in amnestic-type mild cognitive impairment of Chinese Han.,,"Using a cross-sectional case-control study of amnestic-mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), we characterised the relationships among cognitive function, serum levels of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), brain activity, and ACE insertion or deletion (I/D) polymorphism. Forty-eight patients with aMCI and 36 well-matched normal controls were assessed by a comprehensive battery of standardized neuropsychological tests. In addition, regional homogeneity (ReHo) approaches were used to analyze blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging data on the resting state in all subjects, and genotyping of the serum ACE was measured in aMCI patients. The D carriers with aMCI patients were found to have markedly higher serum ACE levels than I homozygote carriers. Importantly, compared with the carried I homozygote group of patients with aMCI, the D carriers of aMCI patients were significantly impaired in the AVLT-delayed recall and had decreased ReHo over the bilateral precuneus, left middle occipital gyrus, right inferior parietal lobe, and right angular gyrus, whilst increased ReHo was found mainly in the left medial frontal gyrus, right paracentral lobe, and right anterior cingulate cortex. The findings indicated that ACE genotype was associated with episodic memory, serum levels of ACE, and resting-state brain activity in aMCI patients, and the findings of cognitive function and brain activity further suggests that the ACE D allele may have a specific role in semantic memory dysfunction and brain activity in aMCI.

subjective cognitive decline","Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease and may develop into amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Finding suitable biomarkers is the key to accurately identifying SCD. Previous resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) studies on SCD patients showed functional connectivity disorders. Our goal was to explore whether local neurological homogeneity changes in SCD patients, the relationship between these changes and cognitive function, and similarities of neurological homogeneity changes between SCD and aMCI patients. 37 cases of the healthy control (HC) group, 39 cases of the SCD group, and 28 cases of the aMCI group were included. Participants underwent rs-fMRI examination and a set of neuropsychological test batteries. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) was calculated and compared between groups. ReHo values were extracted from meaningful regions in the SCD group, and the correlation between ReHo values with the performance of neuropsychological tests was analyzed. Our results showed significant changes in the ReHo among groups. In the SCD group compared with the HC group, part of the parietal lobe, frontal lobe, and occipital lobe showed decreased ReHo, and the temporal lobe, part of the parietal lobe and the frontal lobe showed increased ReHo. The increased area of ReHo was negatively correlated with the decreased area, and was related to decrease on multiple neuropsychological tests performance. Simultaneously, the changed areas of ReHo in SCD patients are similar to aMCI patients, while aMCI group's neuropsychological test performance was significantly lower than that of the SCD group. There are significant changes in local neurological homogeneity in SCD patients, and related to the decline of cognitive function. The increase of neurological homogeneity in the temporal lobe and adjacent area is negatively correlated with cognitive function, reflecting compensation for local neural damage. These changes in local neurological homogeneity in SCD patients are similar to aMCI patients, suggesting similar neuropathy in these two stages. However, the aMCI group's cognitive function was significantly worse than that of the SCD group, suggesting that this compensation is limited. In summary, regional neural activity homogeneity may be a potential biomarker for identifying SCD and measuring the disease severity. ",
pmid_27764124,Influence of Temporal Expectations on Response Priming by Subliminal Faces.,,"Unconscious processes are often assumed immune from attention influence. Recent behavioral studies suggest however that the processing of subliminal information can be influenced by temporal attention. To examine the neural mechanisms underlying these effects, we used a stringent masking paradigm together with fMRI to investigate how temporal attention modulates the processing of unseen (masked) faces. Participants performed a gender decision task on a visible neutral target face, preceded by a masked prime face that could vary in gender (same or different than target) and emotion expression (neutral or fearful). We manipulated temporal attention by instructing participants to expect targets to appear either early or late during the stimulus sequence. Orienting temporal attention to subliminal primes influenced response priming by masked faces, even when gender was incongruent. In addition, gender-congruent primes facilitated responses regardless of attention while gender-incongruent primes reduced accuracy when attended. Emotion produced no differential effects. At the neural level, incongruent and temporally unexpected primes increased brain response in regions of the fronto-parietal attention network, reflecting greater recruitment of executive control and reorienting processes. Congruent and expected primes produced higher activations in fusiform cortex, presumably reflecting facilitation of perceptual processing. These results indicate that temporal attention can influence subliminal processing of face features, and thus facilitate information integration according to task-relevance regardless of conscious awareness. They also suggest that task-congruent information between prime and target may facilitate response priming even when temporal attention is not selectively oriented to the prime onset time. ",

pmid_9125463,The role of posterior parietal cortex in visually guided reaching movements in humans.,,"Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to identify the brain areas involved in visually guided reaching by measuring regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in six normal volunteers while they were fixating centrally and reaching with the left or right arm to targets presented in either the right or the left visual field. The PET images were registered with magnetic resonance images from each subject so that increases in rCBF could be localized with anatomical precision in individual subjects. Increased neural activity was examined in relation to the hand used to reach, irrespective of field of reach (hand effect), and the effects of target field of reach, irrespective of hand used (field effect). A separate analysis on intersubject, averaged PET data was also performed. A comparison of the results of the two analyses showed close correspondence in the areas of activation that were identified. We did not find a strict segregation of regions associated exclusively with either hand or field. Overall, significant rCBF increases in the hand and field conditions occurred bilaterally in the supplementary motor area, premotor cortex, cuneus, lingual gyrus, superior temporal cortex, insular cortex, thalamus, and putamen. Primary motor cortex, postcentral gyrus, and the superior parietal lobule (intraparietal sulcus) showed predominantly a contralateral hand effect, whereas the inferior parietal lobule showed this effect for the left hand only. Greater contralateral responses for the right hand were observed in the secondary motor areas. Only the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices exhibited strong ipsilateral hand effects. Field of reach was more commonly associated with bilateral patterns of activation in the areas with contralateral or ipsilateral hand effects. These results suggest that the visual and motor components of reaching may have a different functional organization and that many brain regions represent both limb of reach and field of reach. However, since posterior parietal cortex is connected with all of these regions, we suggest that it plays a crucial role in the integration of limb and field coordinates. ",

A total of 48 migraineurs without aura (MWoAs) during the interictal phase and 48 age- and sex-matched healthy controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. We utilized masked independent component analysis and seed-based functional connectivity (FC) to investigate whether MWoAs exhibited abnormal FC between subregions in the thalamus and the cortex regions. The MWoAs showed significantly weaker FC between the anterior dorsal thalamic nucleus and left precuneus. Additionally, MWoAs exhibited significantly reduced FC between the ventral posterior nucleus (VPN) and left precuneus, right inferior parietal lobule (R-IPL) and right middle frontal gyrus. Furthermore, the FC Z-scores between the VPN and R-IPL were negatively correlated with pain intensity in MWoAs. The disease duration of patients was negatively correlated with the FC Z-scores between the VPN and R-IPL. These altered thalamocortical connectivity patterns may contribute to multisensory integration abnormalities, deficits in pain attention, cognitive evaluation and pain modulation. Pain sensitivity and disease duration are closely tied to abnormal FC between the VPN and R-IPL. Remarkably, recurrent headache attacks might contribute to this maladaptive functional plasticity closely related to pain intensity. ",
pmid_12681347,The effects of attention on speech perception: an fMRI study.,,"Focusing of attention to a specific speech source plays an important role in everyday speech perception. However, little is known of the neuronal substrates of focused attention in speech perception. Thus, the present study investigated the effects on neuronal activation of directed attention to auditory stimuli that differed in semantic content. Using an event-related fMRI protocol, single vowels, three-phoneme pseudowords and three- and four-phoneme real nouns and words were randomly presented to the subjects during four different instructional conditions. One condition was passive listening without any specific instructions of focusing of attention. The other conditions were attention focused on either the vowels, the pseudowords or the words. Thus, the acoustic stimulation was constant across conditions. The subjects were 13 healthy adults. Functional MRI was performed with a 1.5 T scanner, using an event-related design. During passive listening, there were significant activations bilaterally in the superior temporal gyrus. Instruction to attend to the pseudowords caused activation in middle temporal lobe areas, extending more anterior compared to the activations seen during passive listening. Instruction to attend to the vowel sounds caused an increase in activation in the superior/medial temporal lobe, with a leftward asymmetry. Instruction to attend to the words caused a leftward asymmetry, particularly in the middle and superior temporal gyri. It is concluded that attention plays a modulatory role in neuronal activation to speech sounds, producing specific activations to specific stimulus categories that may act to facilitate speech perception.

pmid_17404117,Magnetic resonance imaging of the thalamus and adhesio interthalamica in twins with schizophrenia.,,"Abnormalities of the thalamus are thought to be central to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. These abnormalities include altered structure and shape of the thalamus itself and possibly changes to the adhesio interthalamica (or massa intermedia), the gray matter bridge connecting the 2 thalamic lobes. However, it is not clear to what extent these abnormalities are determined by the genetic liability for schizophrenia. To investigate thalamic volume and the presence of the adhesio interthalamica in monozygotic (MZ) twins concordant or discordant for schizophrenia. Study of MZ twins. Patients were drawn from inpatient and outpatient clinics. Twin controls were recruited from a volunteer twin register and through media advertisements. A total of 123 twins participated: 19 MZ twin pairs concordant for schizophrenia, 15 MZ schizophrenic twins and 16 MZ nonschizophrenic twins drawn from 17 pairs discordant for schizophrenia, and 27 MZ twin pairs without schizophrenia. Groups were matched for age, sex, handedness, level of education, parental socioeconomic status, and ethnicity. The volume of the thalamus (including right and left hemispheres) was measured (in cubic centimeters) and the presence of the adhesio interthalamica was ascertained from structural magnetic resonance images. Concordant twin pairs displayed significantly reduced thalamic volume compared with control twins, even when covarying for effects of whole-brain volume, age, and sex. There was a significant linear decrease in thalamic volume (control greater than discordant nonschizophrenic greater than discordant schizophrenic greater than concordant). In all groups, right thalamus was larger than left thalamus. There was no difference across groups in the frequency of the adhesio interthalamica. Volumetric thalamic abnormalities in schizophrenia occur in twin pairs concordant for schizophrenia. These abnormalities may mark the substantial genetic contribution to the illness seen in concordant twin pairs, whereas the adhesio interthalamica is unlikely to be affected in schizophrenia. ",

However, amygdala function in pediatric relative to adult bipolar patients has not been compared directly. The authors used functional MRI to compare amygdala activity during a face processing task in children and adults with bipolar disorder and in healthy comparison subjects. Amygdala responses to emotional facial expressions were examined in pediatric (N=18) and adult (N=17) bipolar patients and in healthy child (N=15) and adult (N=22) volunteers. Participants performed a gender identification task while viewing fearful, angry, and neutral faces. In response to fearful faces, bipolar patients across age groups exhibited right amygdala hyperactivity relative to healthy volunteers. However, when responses to all facial expressions were combined, pediatric patients exhibited greater right amygdala activation than bipolar adults and healthy children. Amygdala hyperactivity in response to fearful faces is present in both youths and adults with bipolar disorder. However, compared with bipolar adults and healthy child volunteers, pediatric bipolar patients showed amygdala hyperactivity in response to a broad array of emotional faces. Thus, abnormal amygdala activation during face processing appears to be more pervasive in children than in adults with bipolar disorder. Longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of this developmental difference, thus facilitating developmentally sensitive diagnosis and treatment. ",
pmid_20945256,Dysfunctions in brain networks supporting empathy: an fMRI study in adults with autism spectrum disorders.,,"The present study aimed at identifying dysfunctions in brain networks that may underlie disturbed empathic behavior in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). During functional magnetic resonance imaging, subjects were asked to identify the emotional state observed in a facial stimulus (other-task) or to evaluate their own emotional response (self-task). Behaviorally, ASD subjects performed equally to the control group during the other-task, but showed less emotionally congruent responses in the self-task. Activations in brain regions related to theory of mind were observed in both groups. Activations of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) were located in dorsal subregions in ASD subjects and in ventral areas in control subjects. During the self-task, ASD subjects activated an additional network of frontal and inferior temporal areas. Frontal areas previously associated with the human mirror system were activated in both tasks in control subjects, while ASD subjects recruited these areas during the self-task only. Activations in the ventral MPFC may provide the basis for one's ""emotional bond"" with other persons' emotions. Such atypical patterns of activation may underlie disturbed empathy in individuals with ASD. Subjects with ASD may use an atypical cognitive strategy to gain access to their own emotional state in response to other people's emotions. ",
pmid_16842821,"Neural correlates of antisaccade deficits in schizophrenia, an fMRI study.",,"Schizophrenia patients were known to have oculomotor abnormalities for decades and several studies had found antisaccade impairment to be a biological marker of schizophrenia. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural circuits responsible for antisaccade deficits in schizophrenia. Ten normal controls and 10 DSM-IV schizophrenia patients performed antisaccade tasks and control tasks during fMRI. Data were analyzed and task-specific activations were identified using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM-2). In normal subjects, antisaccade tasks activated bilateral frontal eye fields, supplementary eye fields, inferior frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobules, inferior parietal lobules, occipital visual cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, and lentiform nuclei (P<0.001). By contrast, schizophrenia patients failed to show activation in bilateral lentiform nucleus, bilateral thalamus, and left inferior frontal gyrus during antisaccade performance. Our findings suggest that schizophrenic antisaccade deficits are associated with dysfunction of fronto-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuits previously demonstrated to be responsible for suppression of the reflexive saccade. Left inferior frontal gyrus, which was known to be responsible for response inhibition on ""go/no-go"" testing, also plays an important role in schizophrenic antisaccade deficit. ",

Individuals with distress disorders exhibit disruptions in two corresponding brain networks including the salience network (SN) reflecting emotion/motivation and the default mode network (DMN) reflecting self-referentiality. Using resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analyses, seeded with primary regions in each of these networks, we investigated whether ERT was associated with theoretically consistent changes across nodes of these networks and whether these changes related to improvements in clinical outcomes. This study examined 21 generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) patients [with and without major depressive disorder (MDD)] drawn from a larger intervention trial (Renna et al., 2018a), who completed resting state fMRI scans before and after receiving 16 sessions of ERT. We utilized seed-based connectivity analysis with seeds in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), right anterior insula, and right posterior insula, to investigate whether ERT was associated with changes in connectivity of nodes of the DMN and SN networks to regions across the brain. Findings revealed statistically significant treatment linked changes in both the DMN and SN network nodes, and these changes were associated with clinical improvement corresponding to medium effect sizes. The results are discussed in light of a nuanced understanding of the role of connectivity changes in GAD and MDD, and begin to provide neural network support for the hypothesized treatment model predicated by ERT.

pmid_28930284,Effects of Intranasal Oxytocin on the Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent Signal in Food Motivation and Cognitive Control Pathways in Overweight and Obese Men.,,"Recent research indicates that the hypothalamic neuropeptide hormone oxytocin is a key central nervous system factor in the regulation of food intake and weight. However, the mechanisms underlying the anorexigenic effects of oxytocin in humans are unknown and critical to study to consider oxytocin as a neurohormonal weight loss treatment. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study with single-dose intranasal oxytocin (24 IU) in ten overweight or obese, otherwise healthy men. Following oxytocin/placebo administration, participants completed an established functional magnetic resonance imaging food motivation paradigm. We hypothesized that oxytocin would reduce the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal to high-calorie food vs non-food visual stimuli in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the origin of the mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system. Following oxytocin administration, compared to placebo, participants showed bilateral VTA hypoactivation to high-calorie food stimuli. A secondary exploratory whole-brain analysis revealed hypoactivation in additional hedonic (orbitofrontal cortex, insula, globus pallidus, putamen, hippocampus, and amygdala) and homeostatic (hypothalamus) food motivation and hyperactivation in cognitive control (anterior cingulate and frontopolar cortex) brain regions following oxytocin administration vs placebo. Oxytocin administration reduces the BOLD signal in reward-related food motivation brain regions, providing a potential neurobiological mechanism for the anorexigenic oxytocin effects in humans. Furthermore, our data indicate that oxytocin administration reduces activation in homeostatic and increases activation in cognitive control brain regions critically involved in regulating food intake and resolving affective conflict, respectively. Future studies are required to link these changes in brain activation to oxytocin effects on food intake and weight. ",
pmid_21371747,Alzheimer's disease.,,"An estimated 24 million people worldwide have dementia, the majority of whom are thought to have Alzheimer's disease. Thus, Alzheimer's disease represents a major public health concern and has been identified as a research priority. Although there are licensed treatments that can alleviate symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, there is a pressing need to improve our understanding of pathogenesis to enable development of disease-modifying treatments. Methods for improving diagnosis are also moving forward, but a better consensus is needed for development of a panel of biological and neuroimaging biomarkers that support clinical diagnosis. There is now strong evidence of potential risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and cognitive decline, but further work is needed to understand these better and to establish whether interventions can substantially lower these risks. In this Seminar, we provide an overview of recent evidence regarding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and discuss potential ways to reduce the risk of developing the disease.

pmid_19957268,The neural correlates of sex differences in emotional reactivity and emotion regulation.,,"Sex differences in emotional responding have been repeatedly postulated but less consistently shown in empirical studies. Because emotional reactions are modulated by cognitive appraisal, sex differences in emotional responding might depend on differences in emotion regulation. In this study, we investigated sex differences in emotional reactivity and emotion regulation using a delayed cognitive reappraisal paradigm and measured whole-brain BOLD signal in 17 men and 16 women. During fMRI, participants were instructed to increase, decrease, or maintain their emotional reactions evoked by negative pictures in terms of cognitive reappraisal. We analyzed BOLD responses to aversive compared to neutral pictures in the initial viewing phase and the effect of cognitive reappraisal in the subsequent regulation phase. Women showed enhanced amygdala responding to aversive stimuli in the initial viewing phase, together with increased activity in small clusters within the prefrontal cortex and the temporal cortex. During cognitively decreasing emotional reactions, women recruited parts of the orbitofrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to a lesser extent than men, while there was no sex effect on amygdala activity. In contrast, compared to women, men showed an increased recruitment of regulatory cortical areas during cognitively increasing initial emotional reactions, which was associated with an increase in amygdala activity. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed. ",
pmid_17240066,Hypothalamus and amygdala response to acupuncture stimuli in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.,,"Brain processing of acupuncture stimuli in chronic neuropathic pain patients may underlie its beneficial effects. We used fMRI to evaluate verum and sham acupuncture stimulation at acupoint LI-4 in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) patients and healthy controls (HC). CTS patients were retested after 5 weeks of acupuncture therapy. Thus, we investigated both the short-term brain response to acupuncture stimulation, as well as the influence of longer-term acupuncture therapy effects on this short-term response. CTS patients responded to verum acupuncture with greater activation in the hypothalamus and deactivation in the amygdala as compared to HC, controlling for the non-specific effects of sham acupuncture. A similar difference was found between CTS patients at baseline and after acupuncture therapy. For baseline CTS patients responding to verum acupuncture, functional connectivity was found between the hypothalamus and amygdala--the less deactivation in the amygdala, the greater the activation in the hypothalamus, and vice versa. Furthermore, hypothalamic response correlated positively with the degree of maladaptive cortical plasticity in CTS patients (inter-digit separation distance). This is the first evidence suggesting that chronic pain patients respond to acupuncture differently than HC, through a coordinated limbic network including the hypothalamus and amygdala. ",
pmid_24858795,Trait emotional suppression is associated with increased activation of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex in response to masked angry faces.,,"Emotional suppression (ES) is a critical component of the ability to self-regulate emotion. However, people who chronically use ES as a primary strategy often experience heightened anxiety or depression. Although functional neuroimaging studies have extensively mapped the brain regions involving in emotional regulation, the neural substrates of ES as a trait construct remain relatively unexplored. Using a validated backward masked facial affect paradigm, we examined the association between ES and functional brain responses to masked angry, fearful, and happy faces. Healthy adults underwent functional MRI and completed the Courtauld Emotional Control Scale as a measure of ES. Correlations between self-reported ES and brain responses to the facial affect stimuli (affective>neutral) were evaluated within the brain regions involved in emotional processing, including the amygdala, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. In response to angry faces, higher trait tendency to suppress anger and anxiety was significantly correlated with increased activation within the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, whereas no correlation was observed for masked happy or fearful faces. This finding suggests that the rostral anterior cingulate cortex contributes to the unconscious suppression of emotional responses to angry facial affect and may play a role in the mediating anatomy of trait ES.

pmid_32350038,Visual Size Processing in Early Visual Cortex Follows Lateral Occipital Cortex Involvement.,"TMS
objects' size information
visual processing","Neural activation in the early visual cortex (EVC) reflects the perceived rather than retinal size of stimuli, suggesting that feedback possibly from extrastriate regions modulates retinal size information in EVC. Meanwhile, the lateral occipital cortex (LOC) has been suggested to be critically involved in object size processing. To test for the potential contributions of feedback modulations on size representations in EVC, we investigated the dynamics of relevant processes using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Specifically, we briefly disrupted the neural activity of EVC and LOC at early, intermediate, and late time windows while participants performed size judgment tasks in either an illusory or neutral context. TMS over EVC and LOC allowed determining whether these two brain regions are relevant for generating phenomenological size impressions. Furthermore, the temporal order of TMS effects allowed inferences on the dynamics of information exchange between the two areas. Particularly, if feedback signals from LOC to EVC are crucial for generating altered size representations in EVC, then TMS effects over EVC should be observed simultaneously or later than the effects following LOC stimulation. The data from 20 humans (13 females) revealed that TMS over both EVC and LOC impaired illusory size perception. However, the strongest effects of TMS applied over EVC occurred later than those of LOC, supporting a functionally relevant feedback modulation from LOC to EVC for scaling size information. Our results suggest that context integration and the concomitant change of perceived size require LOC and result in modulating representations in EVC via recurrent processing. ",

Food advertising is particularly pervasive and effective in manipulating choices in children. The purpose of this study was to examine how healthy children's brains respond to common food and other logos. A pilot validation study was first conducted with 32 children to select the most culturally familiar logos, and to match food and non-food logos on valence and intensity. A new sample of 17 healthy weight children were then scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Food logos compared to baseline were associated with increased activation in orbitofrontal cortex and inferior prefrontal cortex. Compared to non-food logos, food logos elicited increased activation in posterior cingulate cortex. Results confirmed that food logos activate some brain regions in children known to be associated with motivation. This marks the first study in children to examine brain responses to culturally familiar logos. Considering the pervasiveness of advertising, research should further investigate how children respond at the neural level to marketing. ",

A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study was performed. A tertiary care university medical center. Ten healthy postmenopausal women (age range 56-60 years) were recruited from the local community. Women were randomized to the order they received combined hormone therapy, 5 microg of ethinyl E(2) and 1 mg of norethindrone acetate, and placebo. Volunteers received hormone therapy or placebo for 4 weeks, followed by a 1-month washout period, and then received the other treatment for 4 weeks. A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed at the end of each 4-week treatment using a verbal memory task. Brain activation patterns were compared between hormone therapy and placebo. Hormone therapy was associated with increased activation in the left middle/superior frontal cortex (BA 6,9), medial frontal cortex and dorsal anterior cingulate (BA 24,32), posterior cingulate (BA 6), and left inferior parietal cortex (BA 40) during memory encoding. All regions were significant with correction for multiple comparisons. Hormone therapy increased neural activation in frontal and parietal areas in postmenopausal women during a verbal memory task.

fMRI","Previous studies of cognitive alterations in borderline personality disorder (BPD) have yielded conflicting results. Given that a core feature of BPD is affective instability, which is characterized by emotional hyperreactivity and deficits in emotion regulation, it seems conceivable that short-lasting emotional distress might exert temporary detrimental effects on cognitive performance. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how task-irrelevant emotional stimuli (fearful faces) affect performance and fronto-limbic neural activity patterns during attention-demanding cognitive processing in 16 female, unmedicated BPD patients relative to 24 age-matched healthy controls. In a modified flanker task, emotionally negative, socially salient pictures (fearful vs. neutral faces) were presented as distracters in the background. Patients, but not controls, showed an atypical response pattern of the right amygdala with increased activation during emotional interference in the (difficult) incongruent flanker condition, but emotion-related amygdala deactivation in the congruent condition. A direct comparison of the emotional conditions between the two groups revealed that the strongest diagnosis-related differences could be observed in the dorsal and, to a lesser extent, also in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (dACC, rACC) where patients exhibited an increased neural response to emotional relative to neutral distracters. Moreover, in the incongruent condition, both the dACC and rACC fMRI responses during emotional interference were negatively correlated with trait anxiety in the patients, but not in the healthy controls. As higher trait anxiety was also associated with longer reaction times (RTs) in the BPD patients, we suggest that in BPD patients the ACC might mediate compensatory cognitive processes during emotional interference and that such neurocognitive compensation that can be adversely affected by high levels of anxiety. ",
pmid_17588776,Modulation of anticipatory emotion and perception processing by cognitive control.,,"Strategies of cognitive control are helpful in reducing anxiety experienced during anticipation of unpleasant or potentially unpleasant events. We investigated the associated cerebral information processing underlying the use of a specific cognitive control strategy during the anticipation of affect-laden events. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined differential brain activity during anticipation of events of unknown and negative emotional valence in a group of eighteen healthy subjects that used a cognitive control strategy, similar to ""reality checking"" as used in psychotherapy, compared with a group of sixteen subjects that did not exert cognitive control. While expecting unpleasant stimuli, the ""cognitive control"" group showed higher activity in left medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex areas but reduced activity in the left extended amygdala, pulvinar/lateral geniculate nucleus and fusiform gyrus. Cognitive control during the ""unknown"" expectation was associated with reduced amygdalar activity as well and further with reduced insular and thalamic activity. The amygdala activations associated with cognitive control correlated negatively with the reappraisal scores of an emotion regulation questionnaire. The results indicate that cognitive control of particularly unpleasant emotions is associated with elevated prefrontal cortex activity that may serve to attenuate emotion processing in for instance amygdala, and, notably, in perception related brain areas.

pmid_17651709,Neural representation of object location and route direction: an event-related fMRI study.,,"The human brain distinguishes between landmarks placed at navigationally relevant and irrelevant locations. However, to provide a successful wayfinding mechanism not only landmarks but also the routes between them need to be stored. We examined the neural representation of a memory for route direction and a memory for relevant landmarks. Healthy human adults viewed objects along a route through a virtual maze. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired during a subsequent subliminal priming recognition task. Prime-objects either preceded or succeeded a target-object on a preciously learned route. Our results provide evidence that the parahippocampal gyri distinguish between relevant and irrelevant landmarks whereas the inferior parietal gyrus, the anterior cingulate gyrus as well as the right caudate nucleus are involved in the coding of route direction. These data show that separated memory systems store different spatial information. A memory for navigationally relevant object information and a memory for route direction exist. ",

visual perception","Extraversion-introversion is a personality dimension referring to individual differences in social behavior. In the past, neurobiological research on extraversion was almost entirely based upon questionnaires which inform about the explicit self-concept. Today, indirect measures are available that tap into the implicit self-concept of extraversion which is assumed to result from automatic processing functions. In our study, brain activation while viewing facial expression of affiliation relevant (i.e., happiness, and disgust) and irrelevant (i.e., fear) emotions was examined as a function of the implicit and explicit self-concept of extraversion and processing mode (automatic vs. controlled). 40 healthy volunteers watched blocks of masked and unmasked emotional faces while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. The Implicit Association Test and the NEO Five-Factor Inventory were applied as implicit and explicit measures of extraversion which were uncorrelated in our sample. Implicit extraversion was found to be positively associated with neural response to masked happy faces in the thalamus and temporo-parietal regions and to masked disgust faces in cerebellar areas. Moreover, it was positively correlated with brain response to unmasked disgust faces in the amygdala and cortical areas. Explicit extraversion was not related to brain response to facial emotions when controlling trait anxiety. The implicit compared to the explicit self-concept of extraversion seems to be more strongly associated with brain activation not only during automatic but also during controlled processing of affiliation relevant facial emotions. Enhanced neural response to facial disgust could reflect high sensitivity to signals of interpersonal rejection in extraverts (i.e., individuals with affiliative tendencies). ",

As part of the dopaminergic pathways, the hypothalamus supports motivated behaviors. Rodent studies suggested inter-related roles of the hypothalamus in regulating drug and food intake. However, few studies have investigated hypothalamic responses to drugs and food or related cues in humans. We examined regional responses in 20 cocaine-dependent and 24 healthy control participants exposed to cocaine/food (cocaine dependent) and food (healthy control) vs neutral cues during functional magnetic resonance imaging. We examined the relationship between imaging findings and clinical variables and performed mediation analyses to examine the inter-relationships between cue-related activations, tonic cocaine craving, and recent cocaine use. At a corrected threshold, cocaine-dependent participants demonstrated higher activation to cocaine than to food cues in the hypothalamus, inferior parietal cortex, and visual cortex. Cocaine-dependent participants as compared with healthy control participants also demonstrated higher hypothalamic activation to food cues. Further, the extent of these cue-induced hypothalamic activations was correlated with tonic craving, as assessed by the Cocaine Craving Questionnaire, and days of cocaine use in the prior month. In mediation analyses, hypothalamic activation to cocaine and food cues both completely mediated the relationship between the Cocaine Craving Questionnaire score and days of cocaine use in the past month. The results were consistent with the proposition that the mechanisms of feeding and drug addiction are inter-linked in the hypothalamus and altered in cocaine addiction. The findings provide new evidence in support of hypothalamic dysfunction in cocaine addiction. ",

Functional connectivity (FC) with rfMRI is the most widely used method to describe remote or long-distance relationships in studies of cerebral cortex parcellation, interindividual variability, and brain disorders. In contrast, local or short-distance functional interactions, especially at a scale of millimeters, have rarely been investigated or systematically reviewed like remote FC, although some local FC algorithms have been developed and applied to the discovery of brain-based changes under neuropsychiatric conditions. To fill this gap between remote and local FC studies, this review will (1) briefly survey the history of studies on organizational principles of human brain function; (2) propose local functional homogeneity as a network centrality to characterize multimodal local features of the brain connectome; (3) render a neurobiological perspective on local functional homogeneity by linking its temporal, spatial, and individual variability to information processing, anatomical morphology, and brain development; and (4) discuss its role in performing connectome-wide association studies and identify relevant challenges, and recommend its use in future brain connectomics studies.

Healthy controls (HC) (n=14; mean age =14.1 ± 2.4 years) and unmedicated PBD patients with manic or hypomanic episodes (n=17; mean age =14.3 ± 1.1 years) were matched on intelligence quotient (IQ) and demographic factors. The fMRI studies were performed at baseline and after 14 weeks, during which PBD patients were treated initially with second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) followed by lamotrigine monotherapy. The pediatric affective color-matching task was used where subjects matched the color of a positive, negative, or neutral word with one of the two colored circles below in each of the trials. There were five blocks of each emotional word type, with 10 trials per block. Behavioral data showed that the PBD group was modestly slower and less accurate than the HC, regardless of condition or treatment status. The blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal activity was reduced with treatment in the PBD group relative to the HC group during the negative versus neutral condition in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), right posterior cingulate gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, and inferior parietal lobule, but increased in left ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC). Similarly, during the positive versus neutral condition, the PBD group, relative to HC, showed reduced activity in right DLPFC, precuneus, and inferior parietal lobule and increased activity in the right VMPFC. However, within the PBD group, there was treatment related decrease in VMPFC and DLPFC. Improvement on Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score significantly correlated with the decreased activity in VMPFC within the patient group. Pharmacotherapy in PBD patients led to differential effort with persistently increased activity in the affective regions and decreased activity in the cognitive regions relative to HC, demonstrating altered mechanisms of affective and cognitive systems of brain function, regardless of symptom response.

However, most of these studies have been carried out in male children. Very little research has been done in adults, and the results obtained in children are difficult to extrapolate to adults. We sought to compare the volume of the caudate of adults with ADHD with that of healthy controls; we also compared these volumes between men and women. We performed an MRI scan on 20 adults with ADHD (10 men and 10 women) aged 25-35 years and 20 healthy controls matched by age and sex. We used voxel-based morphometry with the DARTEL algorithm for image analyses. We used the specifically designed Friederichsen, Almeida, Serrano, Cortes Test (FASCT) to measure the severity of ADHD; both the self-reported (FASCT-SR) and the observer (FASCT-O) versions were used. The statistical parametric map showed a smaller region with low grey matter volume and a smaller concentration of grey matter in this region of the right caudate in ADHD patients than in health controls, both in the entire sample and within each sex. There was a significant correlation between the volume of this region of the caudate with the number of DSM IV-TR criteria, as well as with the total scores and most of the factors of the FASCT-SR and FASCT-O scales. A separate correlation analysis by sex gave similar results. The study design was cross-sectional. The region of the right caudate with low grey matter volume was smaller in adults with ADHD in both sexes and was correlated with ADHD severity. ",

Ten adolescents (mean age 14 +/- 2 years) and 10 adults (mean age 30 +/- 6 years) underwent two scanning conditions that required different levels of cognitive control over face emotion processing. A 'directed' emotion processing condition required judgment of facial expressions. An 'incidental' emotion processing condition required an age judgment. For the incidental emotion processing condition, adolescents, compared with adults, showed less activation in right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and greater activation in paralimbic regions, suggesting greater emotional reactivity and immature prefrontal circuitries for affect regulation. For the directed emotion processing condition, adolescents, compared with adults, showed decreased recruitment of both the dorsal and pregenual right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), suggesting immature modulatory functions of the ACC during directed face emotion processing. These results indicate that the neural circuitries for affect regulation are still developing in adolescence and have not yet reached the adult level. ",

In this study, we aim to replicate a previous study on the neural correlates of face emotion processing above and below awareness level using an independent sample of youth with severe mood dysregulation (SMD) and healthy volunteers (HV). We collected fMRI data in 17 SMD and 20 HV, using an affective priming paradigm with masked (17 ms) and unmasked (187 ms) faces (angry, happy, neutral, blank oval). When processing masked and unmasked angry faces, SMD patients exhibited increased activation in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) and superior temporal gyrus relative to HV. When processing masked and unmasked happy faces, SMD patients showed decreased activation in the insula, PHG and thalamus compared with HV. During masked face processing in general across emotions, youth with SMD showed greater ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activation relative to HV. Perturbed activation in emotion processing areas (e.g. insula, PHG, superior temporal gyrus and thalamus) manifests as hyper-sensitivity toward negative emotions and hypo-sensitivity toward positive emotions may be important in the etiology and maintenance of irritability, aggression and depressive symptoms in SMD. vmPFC dysfunction may mediate over-reactivity to face emotions associated with irritability.

We studied 16 patients with sALS and 13 healthy controls, using BOLD-fMRI, while they performed a simple visually paced motor task. Seven patients had definite clinical UMN signs while nine patients had prevalent clinical and electrophysiological LMN involvement. fMRI data were analyzed with Brain Voyager QX. Task-related functional changes were identified in motor cortical regions in both patients and healthy controls. Direct group comparisons revealed relatively decreased BOLD fMRI responses in left sensorimotor cortex, lateral premotor area, supplementary motor area and right posterior parietal cortex (p < 0.05 corrected) and relatively increased responses in the left anterior putamen (p < 0.001 uncorrected) in sALS patients. Additional analyses between the two patients subgroups demonstrated significant BOLD fMRI response differences in the anterior cingulate cortex and right caudate nucleus (p < 0.001 uncorrected) with more robust activation of these areas in patients with greater UMN burden. Importantly, there were no significant differences in performance of the motor task between sALS patients and controls as well as between sALS patient subgroups. Our data demonstrate a different BOLD fMRI pattern between our sALS patients and healthy controls even during simple motor behavior. Furthermore, patients with sALS and greater UMN involvement show a different reorganization of the motor system compared to sALS patients with greater LMN dysfunction. ",

In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, 21 BN patients and 23 healthy controls (HCs) completed two paradigms: (1) processing of visual food stimuli and (2) comparing their own appearance with that of slim women. Participants also rated food craving and anxiety levels. Brain activation patterns in response to food cues did not differ between women with and without BN. However, when evaluating themselves against images of slim women, BN patients engaged the insula more and the fusiform gyrus less, compared to HCs, suggesting increased self-focus among women with BN whilst comparing themselves to a 'slim ideal'. In these BN patients, exposure to food and body image stimuli increased self-reported levels of anxiety, but not craving. Our findings suggest that women with BN differ from HCs in the way they process body image, but not in the way they process food stimuli. ",

fMRI","Trait anxiety refers to the stable tendency to attend to threats and experience fears and worries across many situations. According to the widely noticed, pioneering investigation by Etkin et al. (2004) trait anxiety is strongly associated with reactivity in the right basolateral amygdala to non-conscious threat. Although this observation was based on a sample of only 17 individuals, no replication effort has been reported yet. We reexamined automatic amygdala responsiveness as a function of anxiety in a large sample of 107 participants. Besides self-report instruments, we administered an indirect test to assess implicit anxiety. To assess early, automatic stages of emotion processing, we used a color-decision paradigm presenting brief (33 ms) and backward-masked fearful facial expressions. N = 56 participants were unaware of the presence of masked faces. In this subset of unaware participants, the relationship between trait anxiety and basolateral amygdala activation by fearful faces was successfully replicated in region of interest analyses. Additionally, a relation of implicit anxiety with masked fear processing in the amygdala and temporal gyrus was observed. We provide evidence that implicit measures of affect can be valuable predictors of automatic brain responsiveness and may represent useful additions to explicit measures. Our findings support a central role of amygdala reactivity to non-consciously perceived threat in understanding and predicting dispositional anxiety, i.e. the frequency of spontaneously occurring anxiety in everyday life.

pmid_22039473,Deactivation of the default mode network as a marker of impaired consciousness: an fMRI study.,,"Diagnosis of patients with a disorder of consciousness is very challenging. Previous studies investigating resting state networks demonstrate that 2 main features of the so-called default mode network (DMN), metabolism and functional connectivity, are impaired in patients with a disorder of consciousness. However, task-induced deactivation--a third main feature of the DMN--has not been explored in a group of patients. Deactivation of the DMN is supposed to reflect interruptions of introspective processes. Seventeen patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS, former vegetative state), 8 patients in minimally conscious state (MCS), and 25 healthy controls were investigated with functional magnetic resonance imaging during a passive sentence listening task. Results show that deactivation in medial regions is reduced in MCS and absent in UWS patients compared to healthy controls. Moreover, behavioral scores assessing the level of consciousness correlate with deactivation in patients. On single-subject level, all control subjects but only 2 patients in MCS and 6 with UWS exposed deactivation. Interestingly, all patients who deactivated during speech processing (except for one) showed activation in left frontal regions which are associated with conscious processing. Our results indicate that deactivation of the DMN can be associated with the level of consciousness by selecting those who are able to interrupt ongoing introspective processes. In consequence, deactivation of the DMN may function as a marker of consciousness. ",

resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging","Recently, both increases and decreases in resting-state functional connectivity have been found in major depression. However, these studies only assessed functional connectivity within a specific network or between a few regions of interest, while comorbidity and use of medication was not always controlled for. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate whole-brain functional connectivity, unbiased by a priori definition of regions or networks of interest, in medication-free depressive patients without comorbidity. We analyzed resting-state fMRI data of 19 medication-free patients with a recent diagnosis of major depression (within 6 months before inclusion) and no comorbidity, and 19 age- and gender-matched controls. Independent component analysis was employed on the concatenated data sets of all participants. Thirteen functionally relevant networks were identified, describing the entire study sample. Next, individual representations of the networks were created using a dual regression method. Statistical inference was subsequently done on these spatial maps using voxel-wise permutation tests. Abnormal functional connectivity was found within three resting-state networks in depression: (1) decreased bilateral amygdala and left anterior insula connectivity in an affective network, (2) reduced connectivity of the left frontal pole in a network associated with attention and working memory, and (3) decreased bilateral lingual gyrus connectivity within ventromedial visual regions. None of these effects were associated with symptom severity or gray matter density. We found abnormal resting-state functional connectivity not previously associated with major depression, which might relate to abnormal affect regulation and mild cognitive deficits, both associated with the symptomatology of the disorder.

pmid_16478667,Cortical mechanisms of person representation: recognition of famous and personally familiar names.,,"Personally familiar people are likely to be represented more richly in episodic, emotional, and behavioral contexts than famous people, who are usually represented predominantly in semantic context. To reveal cortical mechanisms supporting this differential person representation, we compared cortical activation during name recognition tasks between personally familiar and famous names, using an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Normal subjects performed familiar- or unfamiliar-name detection tasks during visual presentation of personally familiar (Personal), famous (Famous), and unfamiliar (Unfamiliar) names. The bilateral temporal poles and anterolateral temporal cortices, as well as the left temporoparietal junction, were activated in the contrasts Personal-Unfamiliar and Famous-Unfamiliar to a similar extent. The bilateral occipitotemporoparietal junctions, precuneus, and posterior cingulate cortex showed activation in the contrasts Personal-Unfamiliar and Personal-Famous. Together with previous findings, differential activation in the occipitotemporoparietal junction, precuneus, and posterior cingulate cortex between personally familiar and famous names is considered to reflect differential person representation. The similar extent of activation for personally familiar and famous names in the temporal pole and anterolateral temporal cortex is consistent with the associative role of the anterior temporal cortex in person identification, which has been conceptualized as a person identity node in many models of person identification. The left temporoparietal junction was considered to process familiar written names. The results illustrated the neural correlates of the person representation as a network of discrete regions in the bilateral posterior cortices, with the anterior temporal cortices having a unique associative role.

peer groups","Previous studies have reported that peer groups are one of the most important predictors of adolescent and young adult marijuana use, and yet the neural correlates of social processing in marijuana users have not yet been studied. In the current study, marijuana-using young adults (n = 20) and non-using controls (n = 22) participated in a neuroimaging social exclusion task called Cyberball, a computerized ball-tossing game in which the participant is excluded from the game after a pre-determined number of ball tosses. Controls, but not marijuana users, demonstrated significant activation in the insula, a region associated with negative emotion, when being excluded from the game. Both groups demonstrated activation of the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), a region associated with affective monitoring, during peer exclusion. Only the marijuana group showed a correlation between vACC activation and scores on a self-report measure of peer conformity. This study indicates that marijuana users show atypical neural processing of social exclusion, which may be either caused by, or the result of, regular marijuana use. ",
pmid_16683265,Progressive increase of frontostriatal brain activation from childhood to adulthood during event-related tasks of cognitive control.,,"Higher cognitive inhibitory and attention functions have been shown to develop throughout adolescence, presumably concurrent with anatomical brain maturational changes. The relatively scarce developmental functional imaging literature on cognitive control, however, has been inconsistent with respect to the neurofunctional substrates of this cognitive development, finding either increased or decreased executive prefrontal function in the progression from childhood to adulthood. Such inconsistencies may be due to small subject numbers or confounds from age-related performance differences in block design functional MRI (fMRI). In this study, rapid, randomized, mixed-trial event-related fMRI was used to investigate developmental differences of the neural networks mediating a range of motor and cognitive inhibition functions in a sizeable number of adolescents and adults. Functional brain activation was compared between adolescents and adults during three different executive tasks measuring selective motor response inhibition (Go/no-go task), cognitive interference inhibition (Simon task), and attentional set shifting (Switch task). Adults compared with children showed increased brain activation in task-specific frontostriatal networks, including right orbital and mesial prefrontal cortex and caudate during the Go/no-go task, right mesial and inferior prefrontal cortex, parietal lobe, and putamen during the Switch task and left dorsolateral and inferior frontotemporoparietal regions and putamen during the Simon task. Whole-brain regression analyses with age across all subjects showed progressive age-related changes in similar and extended clusters of task-specific frontostriatal, frontotemporal, and frontoparietal networks. The findings suggest progressive maturation of task-specific frontostriatal and frontocortical networks for cognitive control functions in the transition from childhood to mid-adulthood. ",

This relationship is so strong that some have called Alzheimer's ""diabetes of the brain"" or ""type 3 diabetes (T3D)"". Given more recent studies continue to indicate evidence linking T3D with AD, this review aims to demonstrate the relationship between T3D and AD based on the fact that both the processing of amyloid-β (Aβ) precursor protein toxicity and the clearance of Aβ are attributed to impaired insulin signaling, and that insulin resistance mediates the dysregulation of bioenergetics and progress to AD. Furthermore, insulin-related therapeutic strategies are suggested to succeed in the development of therapies for AD by slowing down their progressive nature or even halting their future complications.

pmid_19350547,Time-varied characteristics of acupuncture effects in fMRI studies.,,"When studying the neural responses to acupuncture with a block-designed paradigm, its temporal dynamics predicted by the general linear model (GLM) conforms to typical ""on-off"" variations during a limited period of the experiment manipulation. Despite a lack of direct evidence associating its psychophysiological response, numerous clinical reports suggest that acupuncture can provide pain relief beyond a needling session. Therefore, a typical GLM analysis may be insensitive or inappropriate for identifying altered neural responses resulting from acupuncture. We developed a new approach to investigate the dynamics underlying sustained effects of acupuncture. Specifically, we designed two separate models to evaluate the baseline activities (prior to stimulation) and neural activities in sequential epochs, using three block-designed functional runs: acupuncture at acupoint ST36, nonmeridian point (NMP) stimulation, and a visual task. We found that the activity patterns during rest were associated with the stimulus types and that the resting activities might be even higher than that of stimulation phases. Such effects of the elevated activity during rest may reduce or eliminate the activity during stimulus conditions or even reverse the sign of brain activation using conventional GLM analysis. Moreover, such sustained responses, followed by acupuncture at ST36 and NMP, exhibited distinct patterns in wide brain structures, particularly in the limbic system and brainstem. These findings may pose great implications for the design and interpretation of a range of acupuncture neuroimaging studies. ",

voxel-based morphometry","Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with deficits in the dopaminergic fronto-striatal systems mediating higher-level cognitive functions. We hypothesised that a dopamine-regulating gene, catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), would have differential effects on the neural systems of different ethnic samples with ADHD. In Caucasian children with ADHD, the COMT Val-homozygotes have been previously shown to be associated with striatal grey matter volume (GMV) alterations. By using voxel-based morphometry, we examined whether Asian children with ADHD would exhibit a pattern opposite to that found in Caucasian samples. Structural brain images were obtained for Japanese children with ADHD (n = 17; mean age = 10.3 years) and typically developing (TD) children (n = 15; mean age = 12.8 years). COMT Val158Met genotype data were also obtained for the ADHD group. Reduced GMV in the left striatum was observed in the ADHD group versus the TD group. This reduced GMV was modulated by COMT polymorphism; Met-carriers exhibited smaller striatal GMV than the Val/Val genotype. Contrasting with previous findings in Caucasians, the COMT Met allele was associated with striatal GMV alterations in Japanese children with ADHD. These results suggest the existence of ethnic differences in the COMT genetic effect on ADHD-related striatal abnormalities. ",

triple-network model","Resting-state fMRI studies have demonstrated that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with aberrant organization and function of large-scale brain networks. However, the nature of the disruption of cross-network interactions in the key neurocognitive networks in the brain remains unclear. In this paper, we examined the 'triple-network model', including the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and central executive network (CEN), to identify the cross-network interactions in late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) and AD. With resting-state fMRI, we tested cross-network functional connectivity among the DMN, SN, and CEN in 33 AD patients, 24 LMCI, and 25 well-matched normal control subjects. Then, we identified the most influential brain regions affected by AD and LMCI. Finally, we investigated the relationship between aberrant functional connectivity and clinical cognitive dysfunction. We found the cross-network functional connectivity of the SN-centered 'triple-network model' was significantly impaired in the AD group and the alterations were negatively correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. For the LMCI group, the functional connectivity of the SN-centered 'triple-network model' also changed compared to AD; however, we found no correlation with MMSE score. As predicted, the abnormal connections among the three networks mainly overlap with the key nodes of the three networks. Overall, our findings suggested that the interactions of the SN-centered 'triple-network model' are impaired in AD patients and that these alterations contribute to the decline in cognitive function. This 'triple-network model' provides new insights into AD and provides more information about the dysregulation of brain networks in AD. ",
pmid_19630709,The influence of marijuana use on neurocognitive functioning in adolescents.,,"Marijuana use is common in adolescence, yet neural consequences have not been well delineated. This review seeks to ascertain whether heavy marijuana use in adolescence is associated with persistent neurocognitive abnormalities, and whether adolescents are more vulnerable to the impact of chronic marijuana use than adults. Among heavy marijuana using adults, neurocognitive deficits are apparent for several days following use, but may disappear after one month of abstinence. Studies of adolescent heavy users have identified impairments in learning and working memory up to six weeks after cessation, suggesting persisting effects, yet raise the possibility that abnormalities may remit with a longer duration of abstinence. Given ongoing neuromaturation during youth, adolescents may be more vulnerable to potential consequences of marijuana use than adults. This is supported by rodent models, which show greater memory impairments in animals exposed to cannabinoids as adolescents relative to those exposed as adults. Further, adult humans who initiated use in early adolescence show greater dysfunction than those who began use later. Together, these results suggest that adolescents are more vulnerable than adults to neurocognitive abnormalities associated with chronic heavy marijuana use; however, the impact of preexisting risk factors is unknown. Adolescents demonstrate persisting deficits related to heavy marijuana use for at least six weeks following discontinuation, particularly in the domains of learning, memory, and working memory. Further, adolescents appear more adversely affected by heavy use than adults. Longitudinal studies will help ascertain whether preexisting differences contribute to these abnormalities. ",

Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) data of 18 patients with schizophrenia were compared with those of 21 controls. ToM skills were assessed by computerized faux pas (FP) tasks. Patients with schizophrenia performed significantly worse in FP tasks than healthy subjects. VBM revealed significantly reduced gray matter density in certain frontal, temporal and subcortical regions in patients with schizophrenia. Poor FP performance of schizophrenics correlated with gray matter reduction in the left orbitofrontal cortex and right temporal pole. Our data indicate an association between poor ToM performance and regional gray matter reduction in the left orbitofrontal cortex and right temporal pole shortly after the onset of schizophrenia. ",
pmid_17586866,Blunted response to feedback information in depressive illness.,,"Depressive illness is associated with sustained widespread cognitive deficits, in addition to repeated experience of distressing emotions. An accepted theory, which broadly accounts for features of the syndrome, and its delayed response to antidepressant medication, is lacking. One possibility, which has received considerable attention, is that depressive illness is associated with a specific underlying deficit: a blunted or impaired ability to respond to feedback information. Unlike healthy controls, if patients with a depressive illness commit an error, they can be at increased risk of committing a subsequent error, possibly due to a failure to adjust performance in order to reduce the risk of error. In some speeded tasks, performance adjustment in humans is reliably associated with trial-to-trial change in reaction times (RTs), such as 'post-error slowing'. Previous studies of abnormal response to feedback have not investigated RT change in any detail. We used a combination of quantitative modelling of RTs and fMRI in 15 patients and 14 matched controls to test the hypothesis that depressive illness was associated with a blunted behavioural and neural response to feedback information during a gambling task. The results supported the hypothesis. Controls responded to negative ('lose') feedback by an increase in RT and activation of the anterior cingulate, the extent of which correlated with RT change. Patients did not significantly increase their RTs, nor activate the anterior cingulate. Controls responded to positive ('win') feedback by a reduction in RT and activation of the ventral striatum, the extent of which correlated with RT change. Patients neither reduced their RT nor activated the ventral striatum. RT adjustment correlated with self-reported anhedonia for both patients and controls. This behavioural deficit, together with its associated pattern of abnormal neural activity, implies that the anterior midline cortical substrate for error correction, which includes projections from the monoamine systems, is dysfunctional in depressive illness. Many studies have reported abnormalities of the medial frontal cortex in depressive illness; however, the mechanism by which antidepressant medication acts via the monoamine systems remains elusive. Our results suggest a direct link between the core subjective symptom of anhedonia, replicated neuropsychological deficits, electrophysiological and imaging abnormalities, and hypothesized dysfunction of the error correction system.

Eighteen IA adolescents and 15 age- and gender-matched healthy controls took part in this study. High-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed on the two groups. VBM analysis was used to compare the GMD between the two groups. Compared with healthy controls, IA adolescents had lower GMD in the left anterior cingulate cortex, left posterior cingulate cortex, left insula, and left lingual gyrus. Our findings suggested that brain structural changes were present in IA adolescents, and this finding may provide a new insight into the pathogenesis of IA. ",
pmid_15603746,Individual differences in trait anxiety predict the response of the basolateral amygdala to unconsciously processed fearful faces.,,"Responses to threat-related stimuli are influenced by conscious and unconscious processes, but the neural systems underlying these processes and their relationship to anxiety have not been clearly delineated. Using fMRI, we investigated the neural responses associated with the conscious and unconscious (backwardly masked) perception of fearful faces in healthy volunteers who varied in threat sensitivity (Spielberger trait anxiety scale). Unconscious processing modulated activity only in the basolateral subregion of the amygdala, while conscious processing modulated activity only in the dorsal amygdala (containing the central nucleus). Whereas activation of the dorsal amygdala by conscious stimuli was consistent across subjects and independent of trait anxiety, activity in the basolateral amygdala to unconscious stimuli, and subjects' reaction times, were predicted by individual differences in trait anxiety. These findings provide a biological basis for the unconscious emotional vigilance characteristic of anxiety and a means for investigating the mechanisms and efficacy of treatments for anxiety. ",

The present investigation used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in order to test this hypothesis. We compared brain activation of 17 nondepressed and nondemented PD patients with 22 healthy controls during the elicitation of negative affective states. The patients suffered from moderate motor symptoms for an average of 75 months and had stopped their antiparkinson medication 10-12h prior to the fMRI testing. All participants were shown images which depicted disgusting, fear-relevant and neutral contents and they answered self-report scales for the assessment of disgust proneness and trait anxiety. Both groups did not differ from each other in affective state and trait ratings. In line with the self-report, the fMRI data showed similar activation (including the amygdala) in both groups during disgust and fear elicitation. This fMRI investigation found no indication of diminished disgust and fear experience in PD. Previously reported affective processing deficits in PD might be due to insufficiently controlled confounding variables (medication, depression, cognitive impairment). ",
pmid_17499170,fMRI studies of eye movement control: investigating the interaction of cognitive and sensorimotor brain systems.,,"Functional neuroimaging studies of eye movement control have been a useful approach for investigating the interaction of cognitive and sensorimotor brain systems. Building on unit recording studies of behaving nonhuman primates and clinical studies of patients with a focal brain lesion, functional neuroimaging studies have elucidated a pattern of hierarchical organization through which prefrontal and premotor systems interact with sensorimotor systems to support context-dependent adaptive behavior. Studies of antisaccades, memory-guided saccades, and predictive saccades have helped clarify how cognitive brain systems support contextually guided and internally generated action. The use of cognitive and sensorimotor eye movement paradigms is being used to develop a better understanding of life span changes in neurocognitive systems from childhood to late life, and about behavioral and systems-level brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric disorders.

Ten PG and ten controls were scanned while deciding whether to accept (""bet"" option, featuring high-uncertain monetary rewards) or reject (""safe"" option, featuring low-certain rewards) a bet, within situations of decision-making under risk (probability of the ""bet"" reward is known) or ambiguity (probability of the ""bet"" reward is unknown). During decision under risk (as compared to ambiguity), controls exhibited activation in brain areas involved in reward processing (putamen), interoception (insula) and cognitive control (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; middle frontal gyrus). By contrast, PG exhibited no differential brain activation as a function of the type of uncertainty associated with the ""bet"" option. Moreover, prior choosing of the ""safe"" option (as compared to ""bet"" choices), controls exhibited activation in the posterior insula, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and middle frontal gyrus. By contrast, PG exhibited higher neural activation during the elaboration of ""bet"" choices, and in motivational-arousal areas (caudate; putamen; posterior insula). Between-groups contrasts revealed that, as compared to controls, PG showed (i) decreased neural activity in the globus pallidus for decision-making under risk, as opposed to decision under ambiguity, and (ii) increased neural activity within the putamen prior to bet choices, as opposed to safe choices. These findings suggest that (i) unlike control participants, a variation in the level of uncertainty associated with monetary rewards seems to have no significant impact on PGs' decision to gamble and (ii) PG exhibit stronger brain activation while anticipating high-uncertain monetary rewards, as compared with lower-certain rewards.

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how the anticipation of a boring task influences decisions to purchase entertainment. Participants accepted higher prices to avoid boredom compared to control tasks, and individual differences in boredom experience predicted the increase in price. This behavioural bias was associated with higher activity in the caudate nucleus during music purchases driven by boredom avoidance. Insula activation was increased during performance of the boring task and subsequently associated with individual differences in boredom-related decision making. These results identify a mechanism that drives decisions to avoid boring situations and potentially underlies consumer decisions. ",
pmid_21903198,Reduced proactive inhibition in schizophrenia is related to corticostriatal dysfunction and poor working memory.,,"Inhibitory control is central to executive functioning and appears deficient in schizophrenia. However, it is unclear how inhibitory control is affected, what the underlying neural mechanisms are, whether these deficits are related to the illness itself or to increased risk for the illness, and whether there is a relation to impairments in other executive functions. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate two forms of inhibitory control: proactive inhibition (anticipation of stopping) and reactive inhibition (outright stopping). Twenty-four schizophrenia patients, 24 unaffected siblings, and 24 healthy control subjects performed a modified version of the stop-signal paradigm. To assess the relation between performance on inhibitory control and other executive functions, we correlated inhibitory control indices with working memory span. Compared with control subjects, proactive inhibition was reduced in patients and siblings. Reactive inhibition was unaffected. Reduced proactive inhibition was associated with a failure to activate the right striatum, the right inferior frontal cortex, and the left and right temporoparietal junction. Activation during reactive inhibition was unaffected. Those patients with the least proactive inhibition also showed the shortest working memory span. These results suggest that schizophrenia is associated with reduced proactive inhibition, probably resulting from corticostriatal dysfunction. This deficit is related to an increased risk for schizophrenia and likely reflects a general executive function deficit rather than a specific inhibitory control impairment. ",

Although brain-based creativity research has focused on static individual differences in trait creativity, less is known about changes in creative state within an individual. How does the brain augment state creativity when creative thinking is required? Can augmented creative state be consciously engaged and disengaged dynamically across time? Using a novel ""thin slice"" creativity paradigm in 55 fMRI participants performing verb-generation, we successfully cued large, conscious, short-duration increases in state creativity, indexed quantitatively by a measure of semantic distance derived via latent semantic analysis. A region of left frontopolar cortex, previously associated with creative integration of semantic information, exhibited increased activity and functional connectivity to anterior cingulate gyrus and right frontopolar cortex during cued augmentation of state creativity. Individual differences in the extent of increased activity in this region predicted individual differences in the extent to which participants were able to successfully augment state creative performance after accounting for trait creativity and intelligence.

Clinically diagnosed AD and change in global and specific measures of cognitive function. Diabetes mellitus was present in 127 (15.4%) of the participants. During a mean of 5.5 years of observation, 151 persons developed AD. In a proportional hazards model adjusted for age, sex, and educational level, those with diabetes mellitus had a 65% increase in the risk of developing AD compared with those without diabetes mellitus (hazard ratio, 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.47). In random effects models, diabetes mellitus was associated with lower levels of global cognition, episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, and visuospatial ability at baseline. Diabetes mellitus was associated with a 44% greater rate of decline in perceptual speed (P =.02), but not in other cognitive systems.

The functional MRI (fMRI) study was performed in 36 healthy right-handed subjects receiving acupuncture at three acupoints, respectively. Due to the sustained effects of acupuncture, a novel experimental paradigm using the nonrepeated event-related (NRER) design was adopted. Psychophysical responses (deqi sensations) were also assessed. Finally, a newly multivariate Granger causality analysis (mGCA) was used to analyze effective connectivity patterns of the resting fMRI data taken following acupuncture at three acupoints. Following acupuncture at PC6, the red nucleus and substantia nigra emerged as central hubs, in comparison with the fusiform gyrus following acupuncture at GB37. Red nucleus was also a target following acupuncture at PC7, but with fewer inputs than those of PC6. In addition, the most important target following acupuncture at PC7 was located at the parahippocampus. Our findings demonstrated that acupuncture at different acupoints may exert heterogeneous modulatory effects on the causal interactions of brain areas during the poststimulus resting state. These preliminary findings provided a clue to elucidate the relatively function-oriented specificity of acupuncture effects. ",

Prior to treatment brain activity was distinct between the two groups: CBP spontaneous pain was associated mainly with activity in medial prefrontal cortex, while OA painful mechanical knee stimulation was associated with bilateral activity in the thalamus, secondary somatosensory, insular, and cingulate cortices, and unilateral activity in the putamen and amygdala. After 5% lidocaine patches were applied to the painful body part for two weeks, CBP patients exhibited a significant decrease in clinical pain measures, while in OA clinical questionnaire based outcomes showed no treatment effect but stimulus evoked pain showed a borderline decrease. The lidocaine treatment resulted in significantly decreased brain activity in both patient groups with distinct brain regions responding in each group, and sub-regions within these areas were correlated with pain ratings specifically for each group (medial prefrontal cortex in CBP and thalamus in OA). We conclude that the two chronic pain conditions involve distinct brain regions, with OA pain engaging many brain regions commonly observed in acute pain. Moreover, lidocaine patch treatment modulates distinct brain circuitry in each condition, yet in OA we observe divergent results with fMRI and with questionnaire based instruments. ",
pmid_22659025,Gains of item-specific training in visual working memory and their neural correlates.,,"Experts sometimes show higher working memory performance than novices but contrary to this finding, evidence for a positive effect of item-specific training is rare. This study provides evidence for item-specific training gains. We presented Chinese characters and artificial patterns (spotted figures) in a change detection task before and after training (varying set size from 1 to 3). A part of the Chinese characters were trained; others and the spotted figures were not trained. Memory capacity was between one and two items. For set size two, memory performance for trained characters was higher than for untrained characters and they were processed faster. Within superior intraparietal sulcus and middle occipital cortex (part of the putative posterior working memory network), the neural activity asymptotically increased with set size. Untrained items reached the activation maximum already at set size two. For this set size, the activity was significantly reduced for trained items so that a further increase from two to three items was observed. We interpret this difference as a correlate of a gain in neural efficiency. The size of this difference correlated with the training gain in memory. We assume that training causes a more efficient neural representation of trained items supported by long-term memory and this allows holding more items in working memory. ",

Specifically, we investigated whether adults with MDD demonstrated hyporesponsivity in striatal brain regions and/or hyperresponsivity in cortical brain regions involved in conflict monitoring using a Wheel of Fortune task designed to probe responses during reward selection, reward anticipation, and reward feedback. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data indicated that the MDD group was characterized by reduced activation of striatal reward regions during reward selection, reward anticipation, and reward feedback, supporting previous data indicating hyporesponsivity of reward systems in MDD. Support was not found for hyperresponsivity of cognitive control regions during reward selection or reward anticipation. Instead, MDD participants showed hyperresponsivity in orbitofrontal cortex, a region associated with assessment of risk and reward, during reward selection, as well as decreased activation of the middle frontal gyrus and the rostral cingulate gyrus during reward selection and anticipation. Finally, depression severity was predicted by activation in bilateral midfrontal gyrus during reward selection. Results indicate that MDD is characterized by striatal hyporesponsivity, and that future studies of MDD treatments that seek to improve responses to rewarding stimuli should assess striatal functioning.

However, such altruistic behaviors diminish when others are present, due to a diffusion of responsibility. We investigated the neural signatures underlying the modulations of diffusion of responsibility on altruistic punishment, conjoining a third-party punishment task with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging and multivariate Granger causality mapping. In our study, participants acted as impartial third-party decision-makers and decided how to punish norm violations under two different social contexts: alone (i.e., full responsibility) or in the presence of putative other third-party decision makers (i.e., diffused responsibility). Our behavioral results demonstrated that the diffusion of responsibility served as a mediator of context-dependent punishment. In the presence of putative others, participants who felt less responsible also punished less severely in response to norm violations. Our neural results revealed that underlying this behavioral effect was a network of interconnected brain regions. For unfair relative to fair splits, the presence of others led to attenuated responses in brain regions implicated in signaling norm violations (e.g., AI) and to increased responses in brain regions implicated in calculating values of norm violations (e.g., vmPFC, precuneus) and mentalizing about others (dmPFC). The dmPFC acted as the driver of the punishment network, modulating target regions, such as AI, vmPFC, and precuneus, to adjust altruistic punishment behavior. Our results uncovered the neural basis of the influence of diffusion of responsibility on altruistic punishment and highlighted the role of the mentalizing network in this important phenomenon.

Emerging research suggests that a subgroup of children with conduct problems and elevated levels of callous-unemotional traits may be genetically vulnerable to manifesting disturbances in neural reactivity to emotional stimuli indexing distress. Using functional MRI, the authors evaluated differences in neural response to emotional stimuli between boys with conduct problems and elevated levels of callous-unemotional traits and comparison boys. Seventeen boys with conduct problems and elevated levels of callous-unemotional traits and 13 comparison boys of equivalent age (mean=11 years) and IQ (mean=100) viewed blocked presentations of fearful and neutral faces. For each face, participants distinguished the sex of the face via manual response. Relative to the comparison group, boys with conduct problems and elevated levels of callous-unemotional traits manifested lesser right amygdala activity to fearful faces. This finding is in line with data from studies of adults with antisocial behavior and callous-unemotional traits (i.e., psychopaths), as well as from a recent study of adolescents with callous-unemotional traits, and suggests that the neural substrates of emotional impairment associated with callous-unemotional antisocial behavior are already present in childhood.

state dissociation","Evidence is heterogeneous regarding whether patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) display disturbed emotional inhibition in the emotional Stroop task. Previous findings suggest that state dissociation may influence cognitive inhibition of task-irrelevant material, particularly with negative content. Our aim was to examine performance in an emotional Stroop task including negative, neutral, and positive words in BPD patients and healthy controls during functional magnetic resonance imaging. In advance, half of the BPD patients underwent a dissociation induction using script-driven imagery. BPD patients without dissociation induction showed behavioural performance comparable to that of healthy controls but displayed stronger neural responses, especially to positive stimuli, in the superior temporal gyrus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex. BPD patients with dissociation induction showed overall slower and less accurate responses as well as increased reaction times for negative versus neutral words compared with BPD patients without dissociation induction. Moreover, they showed comparatively decreased neuronal activity in the fusiform gyrus and parietal cortices independent of valence, but elevated activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus in response to negative versus neutral words. In conclusion, experimentally induced dissociation in BPD was associated with inefficient cognitive inhibition, particularly of negative stimuli, in the emotional Stroop task. ",
pmid_18835452,Functional topography in the human cerebellum: a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies.,,"Clinical, experimental and neuroimaging studies indicate that the cerebellum is involved in neural processes beyond the motor domain. Cerebellar somatotopy has been shown for motor control, but topographic organization of higher-order functions has not yet been established. To determine whether existing literature supports the hypothesis of functional topography in the human cerebellum, we conducted an activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies reporting cerebellar activation in selected task categories: motor (n=7 studies), somatosensory (n=2), language (n=11), verbal working memory (n=8), spatial (n=8), executive function (n=8) and emotional processing (n=9). In agreement with previous investigations, sensorimotor tasks activated anterior lobe (lobule V) and adjacent lobule VI, with additional foci in lobule VIII. Motor activation was in VIIIA/B; somatosensory activation was confined to VIIIB. The posterior lobe was involved in higher-level tasks. ALE peaks were identified in lobule VI and Crus I for language and verbal working memory; lobule VI for spatial tasks; lobules VI, Crus I and VIIB for executive functions; and lobules VI, Crus I and medial VII for emotional processing. Language was heavily right-lateralized and spatial peaks left-lateralized, reflecting crossed cerebro-cerebellar projections. Language and executive tasks activated regions of Crus I and lobule VII proposed to be involved in prefrontal-cerebellar loops. Emotional processing involved vermal lobule VII, implicated in cerebellar-limbic circuitry. These data provide support for an anterior sensorimotor vs. posterior cognitive/emotional dichotomy in the human cerebellum. Prospective studies of multiple domains within single individuals are necessary to better elucidate neurobehavioral structure-function correlations in the cerebellar posterior lobe. ",

Ten healthy volunteers were enrolled, including 4 males and 6 females between the ages 20 and 34 years with a median age of 23 years. Magnetic resonance imaging (GE Signa HDxt 3.0T) was performed in four groups: Before acupuncture (Control Group), after acupuncture at Zusanli (ST36 Group), after acupuncture at Yanglingquan (GB34 Group) and after acupuncture at both Zusanli and Yanglingquan (Compatibility Group). Differences in the brain ReHo indices of the 4 groups were analyzed by statistical parametric mapping (SPM8) and ReHo data processing methods. The significantly different brain regions were obtained using a false discovery rate correction (FDR-Corrected). The ReHo indices revealed that the main significant effect was in the Compatibility Group. Compared with the resting state of the Control Group, the ReHo values of the Compatibility Group increased in the right middle frontal gyrus (BA8, 9), left superior temporal areas (BA22), ventral anterior cingulate area (BA24) and right inferior parietal lobe (BA40); in contrast, the ReHo values decreased in the left thalamus, right insular cortex (BA13), left inferior frontal lobe (BA9) and right dorsal anterior cingulate area (BA32). Our analysis showed that the Compatibility Group had higher ReHo values than the left inferior parietal lobule (BA40) and right frontal cortex (BA6) of the ST36 Group and the posterior lobe of the right cerebellum, dorsal anterior cingulate (BA32), left and right middle frontal gyrus (BA46, BA9), left precuneus (BA7), right inferior parietal love (BA40) of the GB34 Group. The results of our neuroimaging study suggest that the combination of acupoints could more widely activate areas of the brain compared to a single acupoint. Additionally, the combination of acupoints can activate some new brain areas and generate new curative effects. ",

However, the brain mechanisms underlying this process, especially falsification process which is important in daily life, but especially crucial to scientific reasoning and research is not as yet completely clear. Therefore, in the present study, we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural bases of the falsification process in testing the validity of a conditional statement as used in Wason's (1966) selection task. Our fMRI results showed that: (1) compared with the baseline condition, both Falsification (by using Modus Ponens, and Modus Tollens) and Non-Falsification conditions (affirming the consequent, and denying the antecedent) activated the left frontal areas (BA44/45, or BA6), and basal ganglia, the areas previously found in the rule-guided conditional reasoning operations; the parietal area (BA40, BA7) for recruiting cognitive resources to represent and maintain the different evidential information in working memory. (2) The left middle frontal gyrus (BA9) and cerebellum were shown to be activated in the contrast of Falsification condition versus Non-Falsification condition and in the contrast of MT versus Non-Falsification condition. These results indicated that the left middle frontal gyrus (BA9) might be the key brain region involved in the falsification process of conditional statement for which abstracting and integrating logical relationships, and inhibiting the distraction of the irrelevant information were the essential processes. Moreover, the cerebellum was found to be responsible for constructing an internal working model. In addition, our brain imaging results might support the dual-process theory of reasoning. ",

Thirty-seven subjects were evaluated based on the diagnostic criteria of the International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10), consisting of a depressive group (24 patients after follow-ups) and a healthy control group with 13 normal individuals. All participants received Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) scores and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. The gFCD significantly increased in the posterior-middle insula, the supra-marginal gyrus and the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) before MECT treatment compared to healthy controlled patients. The gFCD statistically expanded in the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC), the orbitofrontal cortex bilaterally and the left-supra-marginal gyrus after MECT, and it decreased notably in the posterior insula. The gFCD in the pgACC and the right orbital frontal cortex of depressive group before MECT showed a positive correlation with HAMD scores with treatment. Conforming to the impact of gFCD in depressive patients after MECT, the aforementioned brain region may become an indicator of MECT effect. ",
pmid_23807175,Gender differences in creative thinking: behavioral and fMRI findings.,,"Gender differences in creativity have been widely studied in behavioral investigations, but this topic has rarely been the focus of neuroscientific research. The current paper presents follow-up analyses of a previous fMRI study (Abraham et al., Neuropsychologia 50(8):1906-1917, 2012b), in which behavioral and brain function during creative conceptual expansion as well as general divergent thinking were explored. Here, we focus on gender differences within the same sample. Conceptual expansion was assessed with the alternate uses task relative to the object location task, whereas divergent thinking was assessed in terms of responses across both the alternate uses and object location tasks relative to n-back working memory tasks. While men and women were indistinguishable in terms of behavioral performance across all tasks, the pattern of brain activity while engaged in the tasks in question was indicative of strategy differences between the genders. Brain areas related to semantic cognition, rule learning and decision making were preferentially engaged in men during conceptual expansion, whereas women displayed higher activity in regions related to speech processing and social perception. During divergent thinking, declarative memory related regions were strongly activated in men, while regions involved in theory of mind and self-referential processing were more engaged in women. The implications of gender differences in adopted strategies or cognitive style when faced with generative tasks are discussed. ",

Thirty patients with ALS and 30 matched healthy controls underwent fMRI with an experimental paradigm while observing a video of repetitive flexion-extension of the fingers at three frequency levels or three complexity levels, alternated with periods of a static hand. A parametric analysis was applied to determine the effects of each of the two factors. Action observation activated similar neural networks as the research on execution of action in the ALS patients and healthy subjects in several brain regions related to the mirror-neuron system (MNS). In the ALS patients, in particular, the dorsal lateral premotor cortex (dPMC), inferior parietal gyrus (IPG), and SMA, were more activated compared with the activation in the controls. Increased activation within the primary motor cortex (M1), dPMC, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and superior parietal gyrus (SPG) mainly correlated with hand movement frequency/complexity in the videos in the patients compared with controls. The findings indicated an ongoing compensatory process occurring within the higher order motor-processing system of ALS patients, likely to overcome the loss of function. • Action observation activated similar core nodes of MNS in ALS and controls. • Increased activation within M1, dPMC, IFG and SPG mainly correlated with hand movement frequency/complexity. • Differences in patients and controls may be due to compensatory processes in ALS.

Ventrolateral prefrontal cortex","Cigarette smoking is intimately associated with both early onset and increased severity of schizophrenia. The self-medication hypothesis suggests that nicotine can relieve or restore neurocognitive deficits and symptoms associated with schizophrenia. Schizophrenia patients and healthy subjects who smoked showed deficits in communication between their hemispheres. These homotopic connectivity mechanisms associated with both schizophrenia and smoking comorbidity were largely unknown until now. A mixed sample including patients with schizophrenia (22 smokers and 27 non-smokers) and healthy controls (22 smokers and 21 non-smokers) based on clinical diagnoses and cigarette dependence were recruited for the current study. All subjects underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine possible interactions between schizophrenia and smoking, and to determine the main effects of schizophrenia and smoking on homotopic functional connectivity. Decreased homotopic functional connectivity of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex suggested a main effect of schizophrenia and smoking-an additive effect. Furthermore, we found an antagonistic interaction effect between schizophrenia and smoking located in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). In addition, the connectivity strength of the bilateral VLPFC was negatively correlated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Negative scores and positively correlated with lifetime smoking. These results suggest that smoking has multiple effects on the modulation of interhemispheric connectivity in schizophrenia. Our findings provide valuable information underlying the pathophysiological mechanisms of schizophrenia and offer a potential target for future clinical treatment of schizophrenia and smoking comorbidity.

Abdominal fat has particularly adverse metabolic consequences and may alter brain pathways that regulate feeding behavior. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to test the hypothesis that high-calorie food cues activate brain reward regions and increase appetite, and to examine the relationship between abdominal fat and brain reward responsiveness in Hispanic women. fMRI was performed while 13 volunteers viewed 12 blocks of pictures of food and non-food items. Participants rated hunger and food desire after each block of pictures. Brain activation to high-calorie foods was determined by calculating a contrast of high-calorie food minus non-food images. Pearson's correlations were used to test the relationship between brain reward activation and waist circumference. High-calorie food images activated brain reward regions (Z > 2.3, P < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons) and increased hunger (P = 0.001), desire for sweet (P = 0.012) and savory (P = 0.009) foods. The striatal response to high-calorie foods positively correlated with waist circumference, independent of BMI (r = 0.621, P = 0.031). Exposure to high-calorie food images activates brain reward pathways and increases appetitive drive in Hispanic females. Abdominal fat, independent of BMI, parallels striatal responsiveness to high-calorie food images. ",

task-related brain connectivity","With advancing age, individuals experience a gradual decline in recollection, the ability to retrieve personal experiences accompanied by details, such as temporal and spatial contextual information. Numerous studies have identified several brain regions that exhibit age-related activation differences during recollection tasks. More recently, an increasing number of studies have provided evidence regarding how brain connectivity among the regions supporting recollection contributes to the explanation of recollection deficits in aging. However, brain connectivity evidence has not been examined jointly to provide an integrative view of how these new findings have improved our knowledge of the neurofunctional changes underlying the recollection deficits associated with aging. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that employed one of the numerous methods available for analyzing brain connectivity in older adults. Only studies that applied connectivity analysis to data recorded during episodic recollection tasks, either during encoding or retrieval, were assessed. First, the different brain connectivity analysis methods and the information conveyed were briefly described. Then, the brain connectivity findings from the different studies were described and discussed to provide an integrative point of view of how these findings explain the decline in recollection associated with aging. The studies reviewed provide evidence that the hippocampus consistently decreased its connectivity with the parahippocampal gyrus and the posterior cingulate cortex, essential regions of the recollection network, in older adults relative to young adults. In addition, older adults exhibited increased connectivity between the hippocampus and several widespread regions compared to young adults. The increased connectivity was interpreted as brain intensification recourse to overcome recollection decay. Additionally, suggestions for future research in the field are outlined. ",
pmid_15670699,View-independent coding of face identity in frontal and temporal cortices is modulated by familiarity: an event-related fMRI study.,,"Face recognition is a unique visual skill enabling us to recognize a large number of person identities, despite many differences in the visual image from one exposure to another due to changes in viewpoint, illumination, or simply passage of time. Previous familiarity with a face may facilitate recognition when visual changes are important. Using event-related fMRI in 13 healthy observers, we studied the brain systems involved in extracting face identity independent of modifications in visual appearance during a repetition priming paradigm in which two different photographs of the same face (either famous or unfamiliar) were repeated at varying delays. We found that functionally defined face-selective areas in the lateral fusiform cortex showed no repetition effects for faces across changes in image views, irrespective of pre-existing familiarity, suggesting that face representations formed in this region do not generalize across different visual images, even for well-known faces. Repetition of different but easily recognizable views of an unfamiliar face produced selective repetition decreases in a medial portion of the right fusiform gyrus, whereas distinct views of a famous face produced repetition decreases in left middle temporal and left inferior frontal cortex selectively, but no decreases in fusiform cortex. These findings reveal that different views of the same familiar face may not be integrated within a single representation at initial perceptual stages subserved by the fusiform face areas, but rather involve later processing stages where more abstract identity information is accessed.

The present study aimed to identify GM alterations in ADHD using pediatric templates. 19 drug-naïve ADHD patients and 18 controls, all aged 7 to 14 years, were scanned using magnetic resonance imaging. Relative to the controls, the ADHD patients had more GM, predominantly in the precentral and supplementary motor areas. Moreover, there were positive correlations between GM volume in these areas and ADHD scale scores. The clinical and pathophysiological significance of increased GM in the motor areas remains to be elucidated by additional research. ",

This paper describes the recovery of a specific vegetative state (VS) case. The patient (OG) remained in the vegetative state for approximately two months, increasing her level of awareness to a minimally conscious state, where she continued for approximately 70 days. In the course of the ensuing 18 months, she was able to reach an acceptable level of cognitive functioning, with partial levels of independence. Throughout this two year period, she received continuous cognitive evaluation, for which several different tools were applied including coma and low functioning scales, full cognitive batteries, and structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We present here preliminary data on fMRI using a word presentation paradigm before and after recovery; we also discuss the difficulty of how to determine level of consciousness using the tools currently available, and the subsequent improvement in different cognitive domains. We confirm that accurate diagnosis and proper cognitive assessment are critical for the rehabilitation of patients with disorders of consciousness. ",
pmid_22451310,Three subsystems of the inferior parietal cortex are differently affected in mild cognitive impairment.,,"The Inferior parietal cortex (IPC), including the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), angular gyrus (AG), and supramarginal gyrus (SG), plays an important role in episodic memory, and is considered to be one of the specific neuroimaging markers in predicting the conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is still unclear whether the connectivity of the IPC is impaired in MCI patients. In the present study, we used resting state fMRI to examine the functional connectivity of the three subdivisions of the IPC in MCI patients after controlling the impact of regional grey matter atrophy. It was found that, using IPS, AG, and SG as seeds of functional connectivity, three canonical functional networks could be correspondingly traced, i.e., executive control network (ECN), default mode network (DMN), and salience network (SN), and the three networks are differently altered in MCI patients. In contrast to the healthy controls, it was found that in MCI patients: 1) AG connectivity was significantly reduced within the DMN; 2) IPS showed decreased connectivity with the right inferior frontal gyrus while showing increased connectivity with the left frontal regions within the ECN; and 3) SG displayed decreased connectivity with a distribution of regions including the frontal and parietal regions, and increased connectivity with some sub-cortical areas within the SN. Moreover, the connectivity within the three networks was correlated with episodic memory and general cognitive impairment in MCI patients. These results extend well beyond the DMN, and further suggest that MCI is associated with alteration of large-scale functional brain networks. ",
pmid_18456517,Perceiving and naming actions and objects.,,"Neuropsychological studies have suggested differences in the cortical representations of verbs and nouns. Assessment of word-class specific deficits often relies on picture naming with different sets of images used for action and object naming. Such a setup may be problematic in neuroimaging studies, as the perception of the image and the actual differences in retrieving verbs or nouns become intertwined. To address this issue, we investigated how different sets of images affect the pattern of activation in action and object naming. In the present fMRI experiment, healthy volunteers silently performed both action and object naming from action images, and object naming from object-only images. A similar network of cortical areas was activated in all three conditions, including bilateral occipitotemporal and parietal regions, and left frontal cortex. With action images, noun retrieval enhanced activation in bilateral parietal and right frontal cortex, areas previously associated with visual search and attention. Increased activation in the left posterior parietal cortex during this condition also suggests that naming an object in the context of action emphasizes motor-based properties of objects. Action images, regardless of whether verbs or nouns were named, evoked stronger activation than object-only images in the posterior middle temporal cortex bilaterally, the left temporo-parietal junction, and the left frontal cortex, a network previously identified in processing of action knowledge. The strong influence of perceptual input on neural activation associated with noun vs. verb naming can in part explain discrepancies in previous lesion and functional neuroimaging studies on the processing of nouns and verbs.

The few studies examining prefrontal cortical responses to emotive stimuli in MDD have indicated increased VMPFC responses to pleasant images but decreased responses to sad mood provocation when compared with healthy individuals. We wished to corroborate these results by examining neural responses to personally relevant happy and sad stimuli in MDD and healthy individuals within the same paradigm. Neural responses to happy and sad emotional stimuli (autobiographical memory prompts and congruent facial expressions) were measured using blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in MDD (n = 12) and healthy (n = 12) individuals. Increased and decreased responses in VMPFC were observed in MDD and healthy individuals, respectively, to happy stimuli, whereas the pattern was reversed for MDD and healthy individual responses to sad stimuli. These findings were not explained by medication effects in depressed individuals. These findings indicate a double dissociation of the pattern of VMPFC response to happy and sad stimuli in depressed and healthy individuals and suggest abnormal reward processing in MDD. ",
pmid_18571795,The salient characteristics of the central effects of acupuncture needling: limbic-paralimbic-neocortical network modulation.,,"Human and animal studies suggest that acupuncture produces many beneficial effects through the central nervous system. However, the neural substrates of acupuncture actions are not completely clear to date. fMRI studies at Hegu (LI4) and Zusanli (ST36) indicated that the limbic system may play an important role for acupuncture effects. To test if this finding applies to other major classical acupoints, fMRI was performed on 10 healthy adults during manual acupuncture at Taichong (LV3), Xingjian (LV2), Neiting (ST44), and a sham point on the dorsum of the left foot. Although certain differences could be observed between real and sham points, the hemodynamic response (BOLD signal changes) and psychophysical response (sensory experience) to acupuncture were generally similar for all four points. Acupuncture produced extensive deactivation of the limbic-paralimbic-neocortical system. Clusters of deactivated regions were seen in the medial prefrontal cortex (frontal pole, pregenual cingulate), the temporal lobe (amygdala, hippocampus, and parahippocampus) and the posterior medial cortex (precuneus, posterior cingulate). The sensorimotor cortices (somatosensory cortices, supplementary motor cortex), thalamus and occasional paralimbic structures such as the insula and anterior middle cingulate cortex showed activation. Our results provide additional evidence in support of previous reports that acupuncture modulates the limbic-paralimbic-neocortical network. We hypothesize that acupuncture may mediate its antipain, antianxiety, and other therapeutic effects via this intrinsic neural circuit that plays a central role in the affective and cognitive dimensions of pain as well as in the regulation and integration of emotion, memory processing, autonomic, endocrine, immunological, and sensorimotor functions.

Statistical parametric mapping was applied for the global and regional comparison of segmented gray matter and white matter images from 20 patients with alcohol dependence and with those from 20 controls. The Rey auditory-verbal learning test, Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test, Stroop test, trail-making test, and Wisconsin card sorting test were conducted as neuropsychological evaluations. There was a significant decrease in both gray matter and white matter globally in alcohol dependence. Bilateral parahippocampal white matter areas were reduced in particular. Perseverative responses and perseverative errors in the Wisconsin card sorting test had significant correlation with the decrease of gray matter decrease including the left superior temporal gyri and right postcentral region. The psychological performance measures correlated with gray matter rather than white matter, whereas right temporal white matter correlated with drinking amount for last 4 weeks. This may imply that alcohol consumption in heavy amounts damages both gray matter and white matter, and gray matter atrophy mainly leads to cognitive impairment, whereas white matter is related to drinking history.

However, whether these structural alterations can be dynamically modulated through tDCS treatment is understudied. To track longitudinally grey matter volume changes in occipital areas in episodic migraineurs during and up to five months after occipital tDCS treatment in a single-blind, and sham-controlled study. 24 episodic migraineurs were randomized to either receive verum or sham occipital tDCS treatment for 28 days. To investigate dynamic grey matter volume changes patients underwent structural MRI at baseline (prior to treatment), 1.5 months and 5.5 months (after completion of treatment). 31 healthy controls were scanned with the same MRI protocol. Morphometry measures assessed rate of changes over time and between groups by means of tensor-based morphometry. Before treatment, migraineurs reported 5.6 monthly migraine days on average. A cross-sectional analysis revealed grey matter volume increases in the left lingual gyrus in migraineurs compared to controls. Four weeks of tDCS application led to a reduction of 1.9 migraine days/month and was paralleled by grey matter volume decreases in the left lingual gyrus in the treatment group; its extent overlapping with that seen at baseline. This study shows that migraineurs have increased grey matter volume in the lingual gyrus, which can be modified by tDCS.

We conducted a multimodal meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry and regional resting-state functional MRI studies in T2DM, including fifteen structural datasets (693 patients and 684 controls) and sixteen functional datasets (378 patients and 358 controls). We found, in patients with T2DM compared to controls, conjoint decreased regional gray matter volume (GMV) and altered intrinsic activity mainly in the default mode network including bilateral superior temporal gyrus/Rolandic operculum, left middle and inferior temporal gyrus, and left supramarginal gyrus; decreased GMV alone in the limbic system; and functional abnormalities alone in the cerebellum, insula, and visual cortex. This meta-analysis identified complicated patterns of conjoint and dissociated brain alterations in T2DM patients, which may help provide new insight into the neuropathology of T2DM. ",
pmid_17558500,Functional MRI of inhibitory processing in abstinent adolescent marijuana users.,,"Marijuana intoxication appears to impair response inhibition, but it is unclear if impaired inhibition and associated brain abnormalities persist after prolonged abstinence among adolescent users. We hypothesized that brain activation during a go/no-go task would show persistent abnormalities in adolescent marijuana users after 28 days of abstinence. Adolescents with (n = 16) and without (n = 17) histories of marijuana use were compared on blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response to a go/no-go task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) after 28 days of monitored abstinence. Participants had no neurological problems or Axis I diagnoses other than cannabis abuse/dependence. Marijuana users did not differ from non-users on task performance but showed more BOLD response than non-users during inhibition trials in right dorsolateral prefrontal, bilateral medial frontal, bilateral inferior and superior parietal lobules, and right occipital gyri, as well as during ""go"" trials in right prefrontal, insular, and parietal cortices (p < 0.05, clusters > 943 microl). Differences remained significant even after controlling for lifetime and recent alcohol use. Adolescent marijuana users relative to non-users showed increased brain processing effort during an inhibition task in the presence of similar task performance, even after 28 days of abstinence. Thus, increased brain processing effort to achieve inhibition may predate the onset of regular use or result from it. Future investigations will need to determine whether increased brain processing effort is associated with risk to use. ",
pmid_15993573,Semantic divergence and creative story generation: an fMRI investigation.,,"The aim of this fMRI investigation was to identify those areas of the brain associated with approaching a story generation task creatively and to investigate the effects upon these correlates of incorporating a set of words that were unrelated to each other-a strategy considered to encourage semantic divergence. Preliminary experiments were undertaken to investigate the possible confounding effects of the scanner environment upon creativity and to reveal the effects of creative effort and word relatedness upon the creativity of those who would be participating in the fMRI scan. In the final part of the investigation, a factorial fMRI design was used to elucidate brain regions involved in increased creative effort and also the effect upon activity in these regions when participants incorporated words that bore little semantic relationship with each other. Results support the notion that areas of the right prefrontal cortex are critical to the types of divergent semantic processing involved with creativity in this context. ",

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to identify concordant regional CBF alterations in T2DM. A systematic review was conducted to the published literatures comparing cerebral perfusion between patients with T2DM and healthy controls using ASL. The seed-based  A total of 13 studies with 14 reports were included in the systematic review and 7 studies with 7 reports were included in the quantitative meta-analysis. The qualitative review found widespread CBF reduction in cerebral lobes in T2DM. The meta-analysis found increased regional CBF in right supplementary motor area and decreased regional CBF in bilateral middle occipital gyrus, left caudate nucleus, right superior parietal gyrus, and left calcarine fissure/surrounding cortex in T2DM. The patterns of cerebral perfusion alterations, characterized by the decreased CBF in occipital and parietal lobes, might be the neuropathology of visual impairment and cognitive aging in T2DM. ",
pmid_22626918,The amygdala is involved in affective priming effect for fearful faces.,,"The object of this study was to investigate whether the amygdala is involved in affective priming effect after stimuli are encoded unconsciously and consciously. During the encoding phase, each masked face (fearful or neutral) was presented to participants six times for 17ms each, using a backward masking paradigm. During the retrieval phase, participants made a fearful/neutral judgment for each face. Half of the faces had the same valence as that seen during encoding (congruent condition) and the other half did not (incongruent condition). Participants were divided into unaware and aware groups based on their subjective and objective awareness assessments. The fMRI results showed that during encoding, the amygdala elicited stronger activation for fearful faces than neutral faces but differed in the hemisphere according to the awareness level. During retrieval, the amygdala showed a significant repetition priming effect, with the congruent faces producing less activation than the incongruent faces, especially for fearful faces. These data suggest that the amygdala is important in unconscious retrieving of memories for emotional faces whether they are encoded consciously or unconsciously. ",

We tested recent hypotheses proposing that psychotic, or positive, symptoms stem from irregularities in long-range white matter tracts projecting into the frontal cortex, and we predicted that selective dopamine D2/3 receptor blockade would restore white matter. Between December 2008 and July 2011, antipsychotic-naive patients with first-episode schizophrenia and matched healthy controls underwent baseline examination with 3 T MRI diffusion tensor imaging and clinical assessments. We assessed group differences of fractional anisotropy (FA) using voxelwise tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and anatomic region of interest (ROI)-based analyses. Subsequently, patients underwent 6 weeks of antipsychotic monotherapy with amisulpride. We repeated the examinations after 6 weeks. We included 38 patients with first-episode schizophrenia and 38 controls in our analysis, and 28 individuals in each group completed the study. At baseline, whole brain TBSS analyses revealed lower FA in patients in the right anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), right cingulum, right inferior longitudinal fasciculus and right corticospinal tract (CT). Fractional anisotropy in the right ATR correlated with positive symptoms (z = 2.64, p= 0.008). The ROI analyses showed significant associations between positive symptoms and FA of the frontal fasciculi, specifically the right arcuate fasciculus (z = 2.83, p= 0.005) and right superior longitudinal fasciculus (z = -3.31, p= 0.001). At re-examination, all correlations between positive symptoms and frontal fasciculi had resolved. Fractional anisotropy in the ATR increased more in patients than in controls (z = -4.92, p< 0.001). The amisulpride dose correlated positively with FA changes in the right CT (t= 2.52, p= 0.019). Smoking and a previous diagnosis of substance abuse were potential confounders. Long-term effects of amisulpride on white matter were not evaluated. Antipsychotic-naive patients with schizophrenia displayed subtle deficits in white matter, and psychotic symptoms appeared specifically associated with frontal fasciculi integrity. Six weeks of amisulpride treatment normalized white matter. Potential remyelinating effects of dopamine D2/3 receptor antagonism warrant further clarification. ",
pmid_18448649,Perceptuo-motor interactions during prehension movements.,,"Adaptive behavior relies on the integration of perceptual and motor processes. In this study, we aimed at characterizing the cerebral processes underlying perceptuo-motor interactions evoked during prehension movements in healthy humans, as measured by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging. We manipulated the viewing conditions (binocular or monocular) during planning of a prehension movement, while parametrically varying the slant of the grasped object. This design manipulates the relative relevance and availability of different depth cues necessary for accurate planning of the prehension movement, biasing visual information processing toward either the dorsal visual stream (binocular vision) or the ventral visual stream (monocular vision). Two critical nodes of the dorsomedial visuomotor stream [V6A (anterior visual area 6) and PMd (dorsal premotor cortex)] increased their activity with increasing object slant, regardless of viewing conditions. In contrast, areas in both the dorsolateral visuomotor stream [anterior intraparietal area (AIP) and ventral premotor cortex (PMv)] and in the ventral visual stream [lateral-occipital tactile-visual area (LOtv)] showed differential slant-related responses, with activity increasing when monocular viewing conditions and increasing slant required the processing of pictorial depth cues. These conditions also increased the functional coupling of AIP with both LOtv and PMv. These findings support the view that the dorsomedial stream is automatically involved in processing visuospatial parameters for grasping, regardless of viewing conditions or object characteristics. In contrast, the dorsolateral stream appears to adapt motor behavior to the current conditions by integrating perceptual information processed in the ventral stream into the prehension plan. ",

cAMP/PKA/CREB","Acupuncture has beneficial effects in vascular dementia (VaD) patients. The underlying mechanism, however, remains unknown. The present study was designed to investigate whether the cAMP/PKA/CREB cascade is involved in the mechanism of acupuncture in cerebral multi-infarction rats. In this study, cerebral multi-infarction was modeled in adult Wistar rats by homologous blood clot emboli. After a two-week acupuncture treatment at Zusanli (ST36), hippocampal-dependent memory was tested by employing a radial arm maze test. The hippocampus was isolated for analyses of cAMP concentration, phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity and CREB/pCREB and ERK/pERK expressions. The Morris water maze (MWM) task and CREB phosphorylation were evaluated in the presence of PKA-selective peptide inhibitor (H89). The radial arm maze test results demonstrated that acupuncture treatment at ST36 reversed hippocampal-dependent memory in impaired animals. Compared to those of the impaired group, cAMP concentration, PKA activity and pCREB and pERK expressions were increased following acupuncture therapy. Finally, the blockade of PKA reversed the increase in CREB phosphorylation and the improvement in recognitive function induced by acupuncture treatment. These results suggest that acupuncture could improve hippocampus function by modulating the cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway, which represents a molecular mechanism of acupuncture for recognitive function in cerebral multi-infarction rats.

pmid_12595206,Objects and their actions: evidence for a neurally distributed semantic system.,,"An influential model of conceptual knowledge claims that objects are represented in a distributed network of cortical areas that store information about different types of attributes, such as form, colour, and motion (A. Martin et al., 2000, in: The Cognitive Neurosciences, 2nd ed., MIT Press, Cambridge). Two specific claims of this account are that (a) the motions and actions associated with objects (along with other attributes) are automatically activated whenever the object concept is evoked and (b) topographically distinct neural regions are responsible for motion/action attributes pertaining to objects in the categories of tools and animals. We used fMRI to examine the neural activation associated with conceptual processing of nouns referring to animals and tools and for verbs referring to tool-associated actions (e.g., drilling, painting) and biological actions (e.g., walking, jumping). We found that object names and their associated actions activated the same set of neural regions (left fusiform gyrus, superior and middle temporal cortex) consistent with the claim that word tool and animal concepts implicitly activate the actions associated with them. However, there was no evidence of category specificity for either objects or actions, with essentially the same activations for the form and motion attributes of both living and nonliving categories.

Seventeen schizophrenia outpatients were included and received palmitate paliperidone injection (PAL) treatment for 13 weeks. These patients were compared to seventeen matched healthy controls. All subjects underwent two scan sessions of resting-state magnetic resonance imaging (baseline and the 13th week) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) at resting-state where compared. After 13 weeks of treatment, PAL increased ReHo of the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus and orbital frontal gyrus, while PAL decreased ReHo of the thalamus, parahippocampal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus. Furthermore, improvement of psychiatric symptoms correlated with changing amplitude of ReHo: positively correlated with postcentral gyrus and negatively correlated with the occipital cortex. Baseline ReHo values of the middle occipital gyrus were positively correlated with the rate of reduction of psychiatric symptoms and improvement of social function. These results suggested that PAL might achieve its clinical effect in schizophrenia by influencing the resting-state function of the occipital cortex, lateral prefrontal cortex and temporal lobe. Baseline function of the inferior occipital gyrus might potentially predict the short-term effect of PAL in schizophrenia. ",

obesity","The prevalence of adolescent obesity has increased dramatically over the past three decades, and research has documented that the number of television shows viewed during childhood is associated with greater risk for obesity. In particular, considerable evidence suggests that exposure to food marketing promotes eating habits that contribute to obesity. The present study examines neural responses to dynamic food commercials in overweight and healthy-weight adolescents using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Compared with non-food commercials, food commercials more strongly engaged regions involved in attention and saliency detection (occipital lobe, precuneus, superior temporal gyri, and right insula) and in processing rewards [left and right nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)]. Activity in the left OFC and right insula further correlated with subjects' percent body fat at the time of the scan. Interestingly, this reward-related activity to food commercials was accompanied by the additional recruitment of mouth-specific somatosensory-motor cortices-a finding that suggests the intriguing possibility that higher-adiposity adolescents mentally simulate eating behaviors and offers a potential neural mechanism for the formation and reinforcement of unhealthy eating habits that may hamper an individual's ability lose weight later in life.

pmid_20079855,Activation in striatum and medial temporal lobe during sequence learning in younger and older adults: relations to performance.,,"The striatum and connected cortical areas have been implicated in sequence learning (SL) tasks, in which performance increments are gradual and learning typically occurs in the absence of awareness. It has recently been shown that increasing striatal activation during SL may be accompanied by decreasing activation in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) across time, but the specific contribution of the MTL to SL remains unclear. In the current age-comparative fMRI study, we show that gradual SL in the serial reaction time task is associated with activation increases in the striatum and activation decreases in the MTL across time in younger adults. However, in older adults, SL is positively related to activation increases in both the striatum and the MTL. The results are discussed in terms of the functional role of the MTL in SL, and offer a novel explanation of the fact that SL is little affected in aging. ",
pmid_15703257,Pictures of appetizing foods activate gustatory cortices for taste and reward.,,"Increasing research indicates that concepts are represented as distributed circuits of property information across the brain's modality-specific areas. The current study examines the distributed representation of an important but under-explored category, foods. Participants viewed pictures of appetizing foods (along with pictures of locations for comparison) during event-related fMRI. Compared to location pictures, food pictures activated the right insula/operculum and the left orbitofrontal cortex, both gustatory processing areas. Food pictures also activated regions of visual cortex that represent object shape. Together these areas contribute to a distributed neural circuit that represents food knowledge. Not only does this circuit become active during the tasting of actual foods, it also becomes active while viewing food pictures. Via the process of pattern completion, food pictures activate gustatory regions of the circuit to produce conceptual inferences about taste. Consistent with theories that ground knowledge in the modalities, these inferences arise as reenactments of modality-specific processing. ",
pmid_12030820,Functional neuroanatomy of emotion: a meta-analysis of emotion activation studies in PET and fMRI.,,"Neuroimagingstudies with positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have begun to describe the functional neuroanatomy of emotion. Taken separately, specific studies vary in task dimensions and in type(s) of emotion studied and are limited by statistical power and sensitivity. By examining findings across studies, we sought to determine if common or segregated patterns of activations exist across various emotional tasks. We reviewed 55 PET and fMRI activation studies (yielding 761 individual peaks) which investigated emotion in healthy subjects. Peak activation coordinates were transformed into a standard space and plotted onto canonical 3-D brain renderings. We divided the brain into 20 nonoverlapping regions, and characterized each region by its responsiveness across individual emotions (positive, negative, happiness, fear, anger, sadness, disgust), to different induction methods (visual, auditory, recall/imagery), and in emotional tasks with and without cognitive demand. Our review yielded the following summary observations: (1) The medial prefrontal cortex had a general role in emotional processing; (2) fear specifically engaged the amygdala; (3) sadness was associated with activity in the subcallosal cingulate; (4) emotional induction by visual stimuli activated the occipital cortex and the amygdala; (5) induction by emotional recall/imagery recruited the anterior cingulate and insula; (6) emotional tasks with cognitive demand also involved the anterior cingulate and insula. This review provides a critical comparison of findings across individual studies and suggests that separate brain regions are involved in different aspects of emotion. ",

Designation of IGD as a formal disorder requires elucidation of its neurobiological features and comparison of these with those of other addictive disorders. The aims of the present study were to identify the neurobiological features of the resting-state brain of patients with IGD, alcohol use disorder (AUD), and healthy controls, and to examine brain regions related to the clinical characteristics of IGD. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 16 subjects with IGD, 14 subjects with AUD, and 15 healthy controls during the resting-state. We computed regional homogeneity (ReHo) measures to identify intrinsic local connectivity and to explore associations with clinical status and impulsivity. We found significantly increased ReHo in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) of the IGD and AUD groups, and decreased ReHo in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) of those with IGD, compared with the AUD and HC groups. We also found decreased ReHo in the anterior cingulate cortex of patients with AUD. Scores on Internet addiction severity were positively correlated with ReHo in the medial frontal cortex, precuneus/PCC, and left inferior temporal cortex (ITC) among those with IGD. Furthermore, impulsivity scores were negatively correlated with that in the left ITC in individuals with IGD. Our results provide evidence of distinctive functional changes in the resting-state of patients with IGD and demonstrate that increased ReHo in the PCC may be a common neurobiological feature of IGD and AUD and that reduced ReHo in the STG may be a candidate neurobiological marker for IGD, differentiating individuals with this disorder from those with AUD and healthy controls.

To provide additional context, we also present a novel analysis of the spatial correlation of gene expression in the brain with the aid of Allen Human Brain Atlas data. Ultimately, examining the relation between IR and AD can be seen as a means of advancing the understanding of both disease states, with IR being a promising target for therapeutic strategies in AD treatment. In conclusion, we highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting brain IR in AD and the main strategies to pursue this goal. ",

In total, 21 female patients with FM and 11 age- and gender-matched healthy controls participated. FM patients underwent fMRI at baseline and following pharmacological therapy with pregabalin to diminish their pain. Pressure-pain stimuli were delivered on the subject's thumbnail bed during fMRI scans. Brain activation regions in fMRI were evaluated for longitudinal changes using a paired t-test. Changes in clinical features were also assessed with the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Widespread Pain Index (WPI), Symptom Severity Scale Score (SSS), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Clinical scores were reduced significantly following therapy with five of the six clinical tests (FIQ, BFI, BDI, WPI, SSS; p < 0.05). Brain activation post-treatment was significantly lower than that pre-treatment in 13 regions of the brain (p < 0.001). Our findings confirm that pregabalin influences aspects of the whole pain matrix, using fMRI, inducing longitudinal changes in neuronal activity during the pain state, and that it reduces pain and other core symptoms of FM. This method could be applied to other longitudinal clinical trials of pharmacological treatments for FM. ",

Further, ALFF value changes in the right hippocampus and bilateral ACC were significantly associated with corresponding MoCA score changes across all groups. We also found increased gray matter volume in the Baduanjin group in the right hippocampus compared to the brisk walking group and in the bilateral ACC compared to the control group. In addition, there was an increased resting state functional connectivity between the hippocampus and right angular gyrus in the Baduanjin group compared to the control group.

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","Exposure therapy is an effective treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but a comprehensive, emotion-focused perspective on how psychotherapy affects brain function is lacking. The authors assessed changes in brain function after prolonged exposure therapy across three emotional reactivity and regulation paradigms. Individuals with PTSD underwent functional MRI (fMRI) at rest and while completing three tasks assessing emotional reactivity and regulation. Individuals were then randomly assigned to immediate prolonged exposure treatment (N=36) or a waiting list condition (N=30) and underwent a second scan approximately 4 weeks after the last treatment session or a comparable waiting period, respectively. Treatment-specific changes were observed only during cognitive reappraisal of negative images. Psychotherapy increased lateral frontopolar cortex activity and connectivity with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex/ventral striatum. Greater increases in frontopolar activation were associated with improvement in hyperarousal symptoms and psychological well-being. The frontopolar cortex also displayed a greater variety of temporal resting-state signal pattern changes after treatment. Concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation and fMRI in healthy participants demonstrated that the lateral frontopolar cortex exerts downstream influence on the ventromedial prefrontal cortex/ventral striatum. Changes in frontopolar function during deliberate regulation of negative affect is one key mechanism of adaptive psychotherapeutic change in PTSD. Given that frontopolar connectivity with ventromedial regions during emotion regulation is enhanced by psychotherapy and that the frontopolar cortex exerts downstream influence on ventromedial regions in healthy individuals, these findings inform a novel conceptualization of how psychotherapy works, and they identify a promising target for stimulation-based therapeutics.

Fifteen male adults with ADHD and 14 controls participated and performed a task-switching paradigm. Behaviorally, no specific executive control problems were observed in the ADHD participants, although they did display more errors in general. The neuroimaging data did show remarkable differences between the ADHD and control adults: Adults with ADHD engaged more strongly the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, middle temporal gyrus, precuneus, lingual gyrus, precentral gyrus, and insula than did the healthy controls during task switching. Controls displayed more task-related activity in the putamen, posterior cingulate gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, thalamus, orbitofrontal cortex, and postcentral gyrus. ADHD adults did not display specific executive control problems at a behavioral level, but did engage different brain areas during task switching compared with healthy controls.

pmid_16766208,The impact of semantic reference on word class: an fMRI study of action and object naming.,,"There is a considerable body of neuropsychological and neuroimaging evidence supporting the distinction between the brain correlates of noun and verb processing. It is however still not clear whether the observed differences are imputable to grammatical or semantic factors. Beyond the basic difference that verbs typically refer to actions and nouns typically refer to objects, other semantic distinctions might play a role as organizing principles within and across word classes. One possible candidate is the notion of manipulation and manipulability, which may modulate the word class dissociation. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the impact of semantic reference and word class on brain activity during a picture naming task. Participants named pictures of objects and actions that did or did not involve manipulation. We observed extensive differences in activation associated with the manipulation dimension. In the case of manipulable items, for both nouns and verbs, there were significant activations within a fronto-parietal system subserving hand action representation. However, we found no significant effect of word class when all verbs were compared to all nouns. These results highlight the impact of the biologically crucial sensorimotor dimension of manipulability on the pattern of brain activity associated to picture naming. ",
pmid_15172761,Pathological gambling: a comprehensive review of biobehavioral findings.,,"In this review, findings of biobehavioral research into pathological gambling (PG) are discussed, focusing on neuropsychological, psychophysiological, neuroimaging, neurochemical and genetic studies. Neuropsychological studies indicate deficiencies in certain executive functions. Psychophysiological studies indicate that arousal in PG is of importance when reward is present. Neuroimaging studies point to abnormalities in brain functioning. Recent research into the neurochemistry of PG indicates that abnormalities exist in different neurotransmitter systems. Finally, genetic studies indicate the existence of abnormal dopamine receptor genes in PG. Methodological and theoretical factors that may explain discrepancies between studies include differences in screening and assessment, heterogeneity of gambling problems and different underlying cognitive or motivational mechanisms. Results from the PG studies fit in with recent theoretical models of addiction and PG, which stress the involvement of brain reward pathways, neurotransmitter abnormalities, the frontal cortex and the psychophysiological stress system. A framework for future studies is suggested, indicating the need for studies that integrate knowledge from different research areas, and that employ stricter diagnostic screening methods and inclusion of clinical control groups.

In the present work, we employed task state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the human brain's activation to US and MA at ST 36 ( Both US and MA at ST 36 produced activations in somatosensory and limbic/paralimbic regions (postcentral gyrus, insula, middle prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex). Only US at ST 36 produced a significant signal increase in the inferior parietal lobule and decrease in the posterior cingulate cortex, whereas MA at ST 36 produced a significant signal increase in the lentiform nucleus and cerebellum.

However, the biological basis of social difficulties in autism is poorly understood. Facial expressions help shape behaviour, and we investigated if high-functioning people with autistic disorder show neurobiological differences from controls when processing emotional facial expressions. We used functional MRI to investigate brain activity in nine adults with autistic disorder (mean age +/- standard deviation 37 +/- 7 years; IQ 102 +/- 15) and nine controls (27 +/- 7 years; IQ 116 +/- 10) when explicitly (consciously) and implicitly (unconsciously) processing emotional facial expressions. Subjects with autistic disorder differed significantly from controls in the activity of cerebellar, mesolimbic and temporal lobe cortical regions of the brain when processing facial expressions. Notably, they did not activate a cortical 'face area' when explicitly appraising expressions, or the left amygdala region and left cerebellum when implicitly processing emotional facial expressions. High-functioning people with autistic disorder have biological differences from controls when consciously and unconsciously processing facial emotions, and these differences are most likely to be neurodevelopmental in origin. This may account for some of the abnormalities in social behaviour associated with autism. ",

Here, we examined pre- and post-treatment rsFC during a randomized clinical trial to characterize alterations and examine predictors of treatment response. Sixty-four combat veterans with PTSD were randomly assigned to prolonged exposure (PE) plus placebo, sertraline plus enhanced medication management, or PE plus sertraline. Symptom assessment and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans occurred before and after treatment. Twenty-nine trauma-exposed combat veterans without PTSD served as a control group at intake. Seed-based and region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI connectivities, as well as an exploratory connectome-based approach were used to analyze rsFC patterns. Based on previously reported findings, analyses focused on Salience Network (SN) and Default-Mode Network (DMN). At intake, patients with PTSD showed greater DMN-dorsal attention network (DAN) connectivity (between ventromedial prefrontal cortex and superior parietal lobule; family-wise error corrected p = .011), greater SN-DAN connectivity (between insula and middle frontal gyrus; corrected p = .003), and a negative correlation between re-experiencing symptoms and within-DMN connectivity (between posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and middle temporal gyrus; corrected p < .001). We also found preliminary evidence for associations between rsFC and treatment response. Specifically, high responders (≥50% PTSD symptom improvement), compared with low responders, had greater SN-DMN segregation (i.e., less pre-treatment amygdala-PCC connectivity; p = .011) and lower pre-treatment global centrality (p = .042). Our findings suggest neural abnormalities in PTSD and may inform future research examining neural biomarkers of PTSD treatment response. ",

We aimed to explore differences in smoking effects on brain function between healthy elderly and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients using ReHo mapping. We identified 64 healthy elderly controls and 116 aMCI patients, including 98 non-smoking and 18 smoking aMCI. Each subject underwent structural and resting-state functional MRI scanning and neuropsychological evaluations. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) mapping was used to assess regional brain synchronization. After correction for age, gender, education, and gray matter volume, we explored the difference of ReHo among groups in a voxel-wise way based on analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), followed by  Three groups were well-matched in age, gender, and education. Significant ReHo differences were found among three groups, located in the left supramarginal gyrus (SMG) and left angular gyrus (AG). Specifically, non-smoking aMCI had lower ReHo in SMG and AG than smoking aMCI and controls. By contrast, smoking aMCI had greater AG ReHo than healthy controls ( Smoking might pose compensatory or protective effects on intrinsic brain activity in aMCI patients. ",

unipolar depressive disorder","This study aims to explore the intrinsic patterns of spontaneous activity of bipolar depression (BD) patients by analyzing the fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (fALFF) that help differentiate BD from unipolar depressive disorder(UD). Twenty eight patients with BD, 47 patients with UD and 29 healthy controls were enrolled to receive the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scans. The group differences of fALFF values were calculated among three groups. In addition, the correlations between the clinical variables and mfALFF values were estimated. The brain regions with activation discrepancies among three groups are located in precuneus, the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) and lingual gyrus. Compared with HC group, BD group shows decreased fALFF in precuneus, the left IPL and increased fALFF in lingual gyrus remarkably; UD group shows significantly decreased fALFF in precuneus, the left MTG and the left IPL. On the contrast of patients with UD, patients with BD have significantly increased fALFF value in the left precuneus, the left MGT and lingual gyrus. Furthermore, a negative correlation is found between the mfALFF values in precuneus and the scores of cognitive impairment factor in the UD group. The similar pattern of intrinsic activity in PCC suggests depressive state-dependent change. The aberrant patterns of intrinsic activity in precuneus, the IPL and lingual gyrus might be provide quantitative nodes that help to conduct further study for better distinguishing between BD and UD.

This pilot study sought to determine if alterations in regional brain metabolism from baseline occur in FM after undergoing a multidisciplinary therapeutic regimen. Regional brain metabolic activity was estimated using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)FDG PET). Nine participants with FM received an 8-week comprehensive treatment program. Serial testing with (18)FDG PET and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire were performed. Statistical analysis was performed using repeated Wilcoxon signed rank tests. A clinical improvement (FIQ median change 20.68, P = 0.005) was noted with treatment. With treatment, increases in brain metabolism were noted in various components of the limbic system (P = 0.004-0.1). An increase in limbic metabolism was noted with concomitant symptomatic improvement, suggesting that the limbic system attenuates FM symptoms. ",
pmid_19811779,The contributions of cerebro-cerebellar circuitry to executive verbal working memory.,,"Contributions of cerebro-cerebellar function to executive verbal working memory were examined using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while 16 subjects completed two versions of the Sternberg task. In both versions subjects were presented with two or six target letters during the encoding phase, which were held in memory during the maintenance phase. A single probe letter was presented during the retrieval phase. In the ""match condition"", subjects decided whether the probe matched the target letters. In the ""executive condition"", subjects created a new probe by counting two alphabetical letters forward (e.g., f-->h) and decided whether the new probe matched the target letters. Neural activity during the match and executive conditions was compared during each phase of the task. There were four main findings. First, cerebro-cerebellar activity increased as a function of executive load. Second, the dorsal cerebellar dentate co-activated with the supplementary motor area (SMA) during encoding. This likely represented the formation of an articulatory (motor) trajectory. Third, the ventral cerebellar dentate co-activated with anterior prefrontal regions Brodmann Area (BA) 9/46 and the pre-SMA during retrieval. This likely represented the manipulation of information and formation of a response. A functional dissociation between the dorsal ""motor"" dentate and ""cognitive"" ventral dentate agrees with neuroanatomical tract tracing studies that have demonstrated separate neural pathways involving each region of the dentate: the dorsal dentate projects to frontal motor areas (including the SMA), and the ventral dentate projects to frontal cognitive areas (including BA 9/46 and the pre-SMA). Finally, activity during the maintenance phase in BA 9, anterior insula, pre-SMA and ventral dentate predicted subsequent accuracy of response to the probe during the retrieval phase. This finding underscored the significant contribution of the pre-SMA/ventral dentate pathway--observed several seconds prior to any motor response to the probe--to executive verbal working memory.

Irritable bowel syndrome
Magnetic resonance imaging","Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are characterized by abnormal central processing with altered brain activation in response to visceral nociceptive signals. The effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on IBS patients is unclear. The study is set to study the effect of EA on brain activation during noxious rectal distension in IBS patients using a randomized sham-controlled model. Thirty IBS-diarrhea patients were randomized to true electroacupuncture or sham acupuncture. Functional MRI was performed to evaluate cerebral activation at the following time points: (1) baseline when there was rectal distension only, (2) rectal distension during application of EA, (3) rectal distension after cessation of EA and (4) EA alone with no rectal distension. Group comparison was made under each condition using SPM5 program. Rectal distension induced significant activation of the anterior cingulated cortex, prefrontal cortex, thalamus, temporal regions and cerebellum at baseline. During and immediately after EA, increased cerebral activation from baseline was observed in the anterior cingulated cortex, bilateral prefrontal cortex, thalamus, temporal regions and right insula in both groups. However, true electroacupuncture led to significantly higher activation at right insula, as well as pulvinar and medial nucleus of the thalamus when compared to sham acupuncture. We postulate that acupuncture might have the potential effect of pain modulation in IBS by 2 actions: (1) modulation of serotonin pathway at insula and (2) modulation of mood and affection in higher cortical center via ascending pathway at the pulvinar and medial nucleus of the thalamus.

pmid_25885533,Action processing and mirror neuron function in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: an fMRI study.,,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a highly debilitating and rapidly fatal neurodegenerative disease. It has been suggested that social cognition may be affected, such as impairment in theory of mind (ToM) ability. Despite these findings, research in this area is scarce and the investigation of neural mechanisms behind such impairment is absent. Nineteen patients with ALS and eighteen healthy controls participated in this study. Because the mirror neuron system (MNS) is thought to be involved in theory of mind, we first implemented a straightforward action-execution and observation task to assess basic MNS function. Second, we examined the social-cognitive ability to understand actions of others, which is a component of ToM. We used fMRI to assess BOLD activity differences between groups during both experiments. Theory of mind was also measured behaviorally using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test (RME). ALS patients displayed greater BOLD activity during the action-execution and observation task, especially throughout right anterior cortical regions. These areas included the right inferior operculum, premotor and primary motor regions, and left inferior parietal lobe. A conjunction analysis showed significantly more co-activated voxels during both the observation and action-execution conditions in the patient group throughout MNS regions. These results support a compensatory response in the MNS during action processing. In the action understanding experiment, healthy controls performed better behaviorally and subsequently recruited greater regions of activity throughout the prefrontal cortex and middle temporal gyrus. Lastly, action understanding performance was able to cluster patients with ALS into high and lower performing groups, which then differentiated RME performance. Collectively, these data suggest that social cognition, particularly theory of mind, may be affected in a subset of patients with ALS. This impairment may be related to functioning of the MNS and other regions related to action processing and understanding. Implications for future research are discussed. ",
pmid_10643726,Acupuncture modulates the limbic system and subcortical gray structures of the human brain: evidence from fMRI studies in normal subjects.,,"Acupuncture, an ancient therapeutic technique, is emerging as an important modality of complementary medicine in the United States. The use and efficacy of acupuncture treatment are not yet widely accepted in Western scientific and medical communities. Demonstration of regionally specific, quantifiable acupuncture effects on relevant structures of the human brain would facilitate acceptance and integration of this therapeutic modality into the practice of modern medicine. Research with animal models of acupuncture indicates that many of the beneficial effects may be mediated at the subcortical level in the brain. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the effects of acupuncture in normal subjects and to provide a foundation for future studies on mechanisms of acupuncture action in therapeutic interventions. Acupuncture needle manipulation was performed at Large Intestine 4 (LI 4, Hegu) on the hand in 13 subjects [Stux, 1997]. Needle manipulation on either hand produced prominent decreases of fMRI signals in the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampus, hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area, anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 24), caudate, putamen, temporal pole, and insula in all 11 subjects who experienced acupuncture sensation. In marked contrast, signal increases were observed primarily in the somatosensory cortex. The two subjects who experienced pain instead of acupuncture sensation exhibited signal increases instead of decreases in the anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 24), caudate, putamen, anterior thalamus, and posterior insula. Superficial tactile stimulation to the same area elicited signal increases in the somatosensory cortex as expected, but no signal decreases in the deep structures. These preliminary results suggest that acupuncture needle manipulation modulates the activity of the limbic system and subcortical structures. We hypothesize that modulation of subcortical structures may be an important mechanism by which acupuncture exerts its complex multisystem effects. ",

The mechanism of ECT is unclear, and studies on ECT in elderly MDD patients by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging are rare. Thirteen elderly MDD patients were scanned before and after ECT using a 3.0T MRI scanner. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) were processed to compare resting-state function before and after treatment. Depression and anxiety symptoms of all patients abated after ECT. Decreased ReHo values in the bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG) were observed after ECT, and the values of right SFG significantly correlated with an altered Hamilton depression rating scale score. Increased ALFF values in the left middle frontal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, orbital part, and decreased ALFF values in the left midcingulate area, left precentral gyrus, right SFG/middle frontal gyrus after ECT were also observed. These results support the hypothesis that ECT may affect the regional resting state brain function in geriatric MDD patients. ",

pmid_19400679,The neural bases of distraction and reappraisal.,,"Distraction and reappraisal are two commonly used forms of cognitive emotion regulation. Functional neuroimaging studies have shown that each one depends upon interactions between pFC, interpreted as implementing cognitive control, and limbic regions, interpreted as mediating emotional responses. However, no study has directly compared distraction with reappraisal, and it remains unclear whether they draw upon different neural mechanisms and have different emotional consequences. The present fMRI study compared distraction and reappraisal and found both similarities and differences between the two forms of emotion regulation. Both resulted in decreased negative affect, decreased activation in the amygdala, and increased activation in prefrontal and cingulate regions. Relative to distraction, reappraisal led to greater decreases in negative affect and to greater increases in a network of regions associated with processing affective meaning (medial prefrontal and anterior temporal cortices). Relative to reappraisal, distraction led to greater decreases in amygdala activation and to greater increases in activation in prefrontal and parietal regions. Taken together, these data suggest that distraction and reappraisal differentially engage neural systems involved in attentional deployment and cognitive reframing and have different emotional consequences.

Parkinson’s disease","Parkinson's disease (PD) with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) is currently diagnosed based on an arbitrarily predefined standard deviation of neuropsychological test scores, and more objective biomarkers for PD-MCI diagnosis are needed. The purpose of this study was to define possible brain perfusion-based biomarkers of not only mild cognitive impairment, but also risky gene carriers in PD using arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging (ASL-MRI). Fifteen healthy controls (HC), 26 cognitively normal PD (PD-CN), and 27 PD-MCI subjects participated in this study. ASL-MRI data were acquired by signal targeting with alternating radio-frequency labeling with Look-Locker sequence at 3 T. Single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping for rs9468 [microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) H1/H1 versus H1/H2 haplotype] was performed using a Stratagene Mx3005p real-time polymerase chain-reaction system (Agilent Technologies, USA). There were 15 subjects with MAPT H1/H1 and 11 subjects with MAPT H1/H2 within PD-MCI, and 33 subjects with MAPT H1/H1 and 19 subjects with MAPT H1/H2 within all PD. Voxel-wise differences of cerebral blood flow (CBF) values between HC, PD-CN and PD-MCI were assessed by one-way analysis of variance followed by pairwise post hoc comparisons. Further, the subgroup of PD patients carrying the risky MAPT H1/H1 haplotype was compared with noncarriers (MAPT H1/H2 haplotype) in terms of CBF by a two-sample t test. A pattern that could be summarized as ""posterior hypoperfusion"" (PH) differentiated the PD-MCI group from the HC group with an accuracy of 92.6% (sensitivity = 93%, specificity = 93%). Additionally, the PD patients with MAPT H1/H1 haplotype had decreased perfusion than the ones with H1/H2 haplotype at the posterior areas of the visual network (VN), default mode network (DMN), and dorsal attention network (DAN). The PH-type pattern in ASL-MRI could be employed as a biomarker of both current cognitive impairment and future cognitive decline in PD. ",

We obtained and compared the LFO amplitude from 25 right-handed discogenic LBLP patients (13 males; mean age 55.16±1.83 years) and 27 well-matched healthy controls (15 males; mean age 52.96±1.63 years). The LFO amplitude was examined using the voxel-wise amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFFs), and partial correlation analysis was performed to determine the relationship between the regions with altered ALFF values and clinical parameters in discogenic LBLP patients. Compared with healthy controls, the patients with discogenic LBLP showed a significant increase in ALFF in the affective system of the pain matrix (left anterior cingulate cortex, right anterior insula/frontal operculum, and bilateral orbitofrontal cortex) and information-processing regions (middle occipital/temporal gyrus). In addition, a significant decrease in ALFF was observed in the default mode network (DMN; inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and medial prefrontal cortex [mPFC]) and the processing system of the pain matrix (basal ganglia/thalamus/midbrain, postcentral gyrus [PoCG], and fusiform gyrus). Several regions with altered ALFF were associated with disease duration, visual analog scale scores, Barthel index, and fine sensory modality measurements (two-point tactile discrimination of the left and/or right leg). Further operating characteristic curves analysis suggested that the mean ALFF values in the right IPL, left IPL/PoCG, left anterior cingulate cortex, and left mPFC could serve as markers to separate individuals with discogenic LBLP from healthy subjects. Our results revealed widespread abnormalities in ALFF in the pain matrix and information-processing regions as well as a decrease in ALFF in the DMN. These results open up an important new avenue to better understand the nature of the link between intrinsic activity and peripheral pain and sensory impairment in discogenic LBLP patients. ",

fMRI","The neural mechanisms that give rise to the phantom sound of tinnitus are poorly understood. This study aims to investigate whether aberrant spontaneous brain activity exists in chronic tinnitus patients using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique. A total of 31 patients with chronic tinnitus patients and 32 healthy age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls were prospectively examined. Both groups had normal hearing thresholds. We calculated the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFFs) of fMRI signals to measure spontaneous neuronal activity and detect the relationship between fMRI information and clinical data of tinnitus. Compared with healthy controls, we observed significant increased ALFF within several selected regions including the right middle temporal gyrus (MTG), right superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and right angular gyrus; decreased ALFF was detected in the left cuneus, right middle occipital gyrus and bilateral thalamus. Moreover, tinnitus distress correlated positively with increased ALFF in right MTG and right SFG; tinnitus duration correlated positively with higher ALFF values in right SFG. The present study confirms that chronic tinnitus patients have aberrant ALFF in many brain regions, which is associated with specific clinical tinnitus characteristics. ALFF disturbance in specific brain regions might be used to identify the neuro-pathophysiological mechanisms in chronic tinnitus patients. ",
pmid_19129395,Dynamic changes in brain activity during prism adaptation.,,"Prism adaptation does not only induce short-term sensorimotor plasticity, but also longer-term reorganization in the neural representation of space. We used event-related fMRI to study dynamic changes in brain activity during both early and prolonged exposure to visual prisms. Participants performed a pointing task before, during, and after prism exposure. Measures of trial-by-trial pointing errors and corrections allowed parametric analyses of brain activity as a function of performance. We show that during the earliest phase of prism exposure, anterior intraparietal sulcus was primarily implicated in error detection, whereas parieto-occipital sulcus was implicated in error correction. Cerebellum activity showed progressive increases during prism exposure, in accordance with a key role for spatial realignment. This time course further suggests that the cerebellum might promote neural changes in superior temporal cortex, which was selectively activated during the later phase of prism exposure and could mediate the effects of prism adaptation on cognitive spatial representations.

pmid_20955187,A multimodal approach to emotion recognition ability in autism spectrum disorders.,,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterised by social and communication difficulties in day-to-day life, including problems in recognising emotions. However, experimental investigations of emotion recognition ability in ASD have been equivocal, hampered by small sample sizes, narrow IQ range and over-focus on the visual modality. We tested 99 adolescents (mean age 15;6 years, mean IQ 85) with an ASD and 57 adolescents without an ASD (mean age 15;6 years, mean IQ 88) on a facial emotion recognition task and two vocal emotion recognition tasks (one verbal; one non-verbal). Recognition of happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise and disgust were tested. Using structural equation modelling, we conceptualised emotion recognition ability as a multimodal construct, measured by the three tasks. We examined how the mean levels of recognition of the six emotions differed by group (ASD vs. non-ASD) and IQ (≥ 80 vs. < 80). We found no evidence of a fundamental emotion recognition deficit in the ASD group and analysis of error patterns suggested that the ASD group were vulnerable to the same pattern of confusions between emotions as the non-ASD group. However, recognition ability was significantly impaired in the ASD group for surprise. IQ had a strong and significant effect on performance for the recognition of all six emotions, with higher IQ adolescents outperforming lower IQ adolescents. The findings do not suggest a fundamental difficulty with the recognition of basic emotions in adolescents with ASD. ",

Right temporal lobe and right temporal gray matter volumes were significantly reduced in subjects with conduct disorder compared with controls. Prefrontal volumes in subjects with conduct disorder were 16% smaller than in controls, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Early onset conduct disorder without substance abuse comorbidity was also significantly associated with smaller right temporal gray volumes. Further investigation of both the temporal and frontal localizations of the pathophysiology of early onset conduct disorder is warranted in larger samples. ",

Thirteen patients with AN and 10 healthy control subjects (aged 13-21) rated visual food and non-food stimuli for pleasantness during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a hungry and a satiated state. AN patients rated food as less pleasant than controls. When satiated, AN patients showed decreased activation in left inferior parietal cortex relative to controls. When hungry, AN patients displayed weaker activation of the right visual occipital cortex than healthy controls. Food stimuli during satiety compared with hunger were associated with stronger right occipital activation in patients and with stronger activation in left lateral orbitofrontal cortex, the middle portion of the right anterior cingulate, and left middle temporal gyrus in controls. The observed group differences in the fMRI activation to food pictures point to decreased food-related somatosensory processing in AN during satiety and to attentional mechanisms during hunger that might facilitate restricted eating in AN.

Resting-state functional connectivity","Aberrant patterns of brain functional connectivity in the default mode network (DMN) have been observed across different classes of substance use disorder (SUD) and are associated with craving and relapse. In addicted individuals resting functional connectivity (RSFC) of the anterior DMN, which participates in attribution of personal value and emotional regulation, tends to be decreased, whereas RSFC of the posterior DMN, which directs attention to the internal world, tends to be increased. Aberrant RSFC within the DMN is believed to contribute to impaired self-awareness, negative emotions and to ruminations in addiction. Additionally, the disrupted connectivity between DMN and cortical regions involved with executive function, memory and emotion could be critical to drug-taking regardless of negative consequences and to stress-triggered relapse. At the system level, the dynamics of DMN interactions with the executive control and the salience networks are also disturbed in addiction. The DMN is prominently engaged during the withdrawal and preoccupation phases of the addiction cycle at the expense of the executive control network and with an enhanced participation of the salience network. In contrast, DMN prominence appears to be transitorily decreased during the intoxication phases. There is also growing evidence that disruption of the DMN in addiction reflects in part changes in dopaminergic, glutamatergic, and GABAergic signaling associated with acute and chronic drug use. Findings are starting to reveal DMN RSFC as a potential biomarker for predicting clinical outcomes in SUD and identify the DMN as a promising target for the treatment of addiction. ",

These deficits are said to lead to impaired socio-cognitive development, such as theory of mind (ToM). There is little research focused on the relation between social motivation and ToM in this population. The goal of the present study was to investigate the link between one aspect of social motivation, social orienting, and ToM in preschoolers with ASD. It was expected that, in contrast to typically developing (TD) children, children with ASD would show impaired performance on tasks measuring social orienting and ToM. It was also expected that children's performance on the social orienting tasks would be correlated with their performance on the ToM task. A total of 17 children with ASD and 16 TD children participated in this study. Participants completed two social orienting tasks, a face preference task and a biological motion preference task, as well an implicit false belief task. Results reveal that TD children, but not children with ASD, exhibited social preference as measured by a preference for faces and biological motion. Furthermore, children with ASD tended to perform worse on the ToM task compared to their TD counterparts. Performance on the social motivation tasks and the ToM task tended to be related but only for the TD children. These findings suggest that ToM is multifaceted and that motivational deficits might have downstream effects even on implicit ToM.

The goal of the present study was to examine the link between poor attention to social information and mindreading abilities in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Results demonstrated that children with ASD tended to perform worse than neurotypical children on both social orienting and theory of mind tasks. Preference for human faces and motion tended to be related but only for the neurotypical children. These findings provide partial support for the social motivation theory. ",

fMRI","Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious condition involving emotion dysregulation. Past research has identified BPD-associated differences within fronto-limbic circuitry during conditions of processing negative emotion. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigms that incorporate overt and covert (masked) presentations of emotional stimuli can provide complementary information about neural systems underlying emotion processing (e.g., both slow [overt] and fast [covert; automatic] processing pathways). This study examined brain activation during processing of overt and covert presentations of emotional faces in 12 women with BPD and 12 age-matched healthy controls. To assess a range of emotional valence and arousal, we examined responses to fear, happy and neutral expressions. All participants underwent an fMRI scanning session in which participants passively viewed emotional faces. Scanning sessions consisted of 5 runs including: (1) Overt Fear (OF) versus Neutral (N), (2) Covert Fear (CF) versus Covert Neutral (CN), (3) Overt Happy (OH) versus N, (4) Covert Happy (CH) versus CN, and (5) N versus fixation. We compared whole-brain activation between groups for each run. In response to overt fear, BPD patients showed greater activation both in left amygdala and in several frontal cortical regions. There were no significant differences in brain activation in response to overt happy faces. In response to covert fear and covert happy stimuli, the BPD group also showed greater activation than controls in several regions including frontal and temporal cortical regions, as well as cerebellum and thalamus. These findings add to prior reports suggesting increased amygdala activation in BPD, but we found this only in the overt fear versus fixation condition. In this sample, BPD patients showed hyper-activation, rather than hypo-activation, of cortical regulatory regions during overt fear. Enhanced cortical recruitment in response to covert fear and happy faces in BPD could reflect a more extended response system in which stimuli that typically only activate automatic pathways are additionally tapping into cortical regulatory systems. The observation of this pattern both in response to fear and in response to happy presentations suggests that the effect of arousal may be as or more impactful than the effect of emotional valence.

pmid_20494266,Cannabis use and memory brain function in adolescent boys: a cross-sectional multicenter functional magnetic resonance imaging study.,,"Early-onset cannabis use has been associated with later use/abuse, mental health problems (psychosis, depression), and abnormal development of cognition and brain function. During adolescence, ongoing neurodevelopmental maturation and experience shape the neural circuitry underlying complex cognitive functions such as memory and executive control. Prefrontal and temporal regions are critically involved in these functions. Maturational processes leave these brain areas prone to the potentially harmful effects of cannabis use. We performed a two-site (United States and The Netherlands; pooled data) functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study with a cross-sectional design, investigating the effects of adolescent cannabis use on working memory (WM) and associative memory (AM) brain function in 21 abstinent but frequent cannabis-using boys (13-19) years of age and compared them with 24 nonusing peers. Brain activity during WM was assessed before and after rule-based learning (automatization). AM was assessed using a pictorial hippocampal-dependent memory task. Cannabis users performed normally on both memory tasks. During WM assessment, cannabis users showed excessive activity in prefrontal regions when a task was novel, whereas automatization of the task reduced activity to the same level in users and controls. No effect of cannabis use on AM-related brain function was found. In adolescent cannabis users, the WM system was overactive during a novel task, suggesting functional compensation. Inefficient WM recruitment was not related to a failure in automatization but became evident when processing continuously changing information. The results seem to confirm the vulnerability of still developing frontal lobe functioning for early-onset cannabis use. ",

The at-risk youth were unaffected, in that they had no history of mood disorder. Amygdala activity was examined in 101 unrelated participants, 8 to 18 years old. Age, gender, and IQ-matched groups included BD (N = 32), unaffected at-risk (N = 13), and HC (N = 56). During functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants attended to emotional and nonemotional aspects of fearful and happy faces. While rating their fear of fearful faces, both BD and unaffected at-risk subjects exhibited amygdala hyperactivity versus HC. There were no between-group differences in amygdala activity in response to happy faces. Post-hoc comparisons revealed that, in at-risk youth, familial risk status (offspring versus sibling), presence of Axis I diagnosis (n = 1 attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], n = 1 social phobia), and history of medication exposure (n = 1) did not influence imaging findings. We found amygdala hyperactivation in both unaffected at-risk and BD youth while rating their fear of fearful faces. These pilot data suggest that both face emotion labeling deficits and amygdala hyperactivity during face processing should receive further study as potential BD endophenotypes. Longitudinal studies should test whether amygdala hyperactivity to fearful faces predicts conversion to BD in at-risk youth. ",
pmid_12727696,Functional disconnection between the prefrontal and parietal cortices during working memory processing in schizophrenia: a[15(O)]H2O PET study.,,"The prefrontal-parietal circuits have been reported to play an important role in working memory. The purpose of this study was to use direct neuroimaging to address whether interregional correlation in the prefrontal-parietal circuits is impaired in schizophrenia. [(15)O]H(2)O positron emission tomography was used to compare regional blood flow changes in 12 schizophrenic and 12 healthy comparison subjects during the n-back sequential-picture working memory task. Interregional correlation was assessed by correlating the regional activation of the lateral prefrontal area with that of other activated areas in each subject group. Dorsolateral prefrontal activation was observed around the right superior frontal sulcus in the healthy subjects, and ventrolateral prefrontal activation below the right inferior frontal sulcus was observed in the schizophrenic patients. Activation in the right lateral prefrontal cortex was significantly correlated with activation in the bilateral inferior parietal region in the healthy subjects but was not correlated with any regional activation in the patients. The findings suggest prefrontal-parietal functional disconnection, particularly prefrontal dissociation and abnormal prefrontal-parietal interaction, during working memory processing in schizophrenia.

pmid_23643836,Association of callous traits with reduced neural response to others' pain in children with conduct problems.,,"Children with conduct problems (CP) persistently violate others' rights and represent a considerable societal cost. These children also display atypical empathic responses to others' distress, which may partly account for their violent and antisocial behavior. Callous traits index lack of empathy in these children and confer risk for adult psychopathy. Investigating neural responses to others' pain is an ecologically valid method to probe empathic processing, but studies in children with CP have been inconclusive. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we measured neural responses to pictures of others in pain (versus no pain) in a large sample of children with CP and matched controls. Relative to controls, children with CP showed reduced blood oxygen level-dependent responses to others' pain in bilateral anterior insula (AI), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and inferior frontal gyrus, regions associated with empathy for pain in previous studies. In the CP group, callous traits were negatively associated with responses to others' pain in AI and ACC. We conclude that children with CP have atypical neural responses to others' pain. The negative association between callous traits and AI/ACC response could reflect an early neurobiological marker indexing risk for empathic deficits seen in adult psychopathy. ",
pmid_19052540,Patients with schizophrenia have a reduced neural response to both unpredictable and predictable primary reinforcers.,,"One prevalent theory of learning states that dopamine neurons signal mismatches between expected and actual outcomes, called temporal difference errors (TDEs). Evidence indicates that dopamine system dysfunction is involved in negative symptoms of schizophrenia (SZ), including avolition and anhedonia. As such, we predicted that brain responses to TDEs in dopamine midbrain nuclei and target areas would be abnormal in SZ. A total of 18 clinically stable patients with chronic SZ and 18 controls participated in an fMRI study, which used a passive conditioning task. In the task, the delivery of a small amount of juice followed a light stimulus by exactly 6 s on approximately 75% of 78 total trials, and was further delayed by 4-7 s on the remaining trials. The delayed juice delivery was designed to elicit the two types of TDE signals, associated with the recognition that a reward was omitted at the expected time, and delivered at an unexpected time. Main effects of TDE valence and group differences in the positive-negative TDE contrast (unexpected juice deliveries-juice omissions) were assessed through whole-brain and regions of interest (ROI) analyses. Main effects of TDE valence were observed for the entire sample in the midbrain, left putamen, left cerebellum, and primary gustatory cortex, bilaterally. Whole-brain analyses revealed group differences in the positive-negative TDE contrast in the right putamen and left precentral gyrus, whereas ROI analyses revealed additional group differences in the midbrain, insula, and parietal operculum, on the right, the putamen and cerebellum, on the left, and the frontal operculum, bilaterally. Further, these group differences were generally driven by attenuated responses in patients to positive TDEs (unexpected juice deliveries), whereas responses to negative TDEs (unexpected juice omissions) were largely intact. Patients also showed reductions in responses to juice deliveries on standard trials, and more blunted reinforcer responses in the left putamen corresponded to higher ratings of avolition. These results provide evidence that SZ patients show abnormal brain responses associated with the processing of a primary reinforcer, which may be a source of motivational deficits. ",
pmid_17507455,The neural substrate of naming events: effects of processing demands but not of grammatical class.,,"Grammatical class is a fundamental property of language, and all natural languages distinguish between nouns and verbs. Brain activation studies have provided conflicting evidence concerning the neural substrates of noun and verb processing. A major limitation of many previous imaging studies is that they did not disentangle the impact of grammatical class from the differences in semantic correlates. In order to tease apart the role of semantic and grammatical factors, we performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging study presenting Italian speakers with pictures of events and asked them to name them as 1) Infinitive Verb (e.g., mangiare [to eat]); 2) Inflected Verb (e.g., mangia [she/he eats]); and 3) Action Noun (e.g., mangiata [the eating]). We did not find any verb-specific activation. However, reliable left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) activations were found when contrasting the Action Noun with the Infinitive Verb condition. A second-level analysis indicated then that activation in left IFG was greatest for Action Nouns, intermediate for Inflected Verbs, and least for Infinitive Verbs. We conclude that, when all other factors are controlled, nouns and verbs are processed by a common neural system. In the present case, differences in left IFG activation emerge as a consequence of increasing linguistic and/or general processing demands. ",
pmid_19222326,Neurological correlates of reward responding in adolescents with and without externalizing behavior disorders.,,"Opposing theories of striatal hyper- and hypodopaminergic functioning have been suggested in the pathophysiology of externalizing behavior disorders. To test these competing theories, the authors used functional MRI to evaluate neural activity during a simple reward task in 12- to 16-year-old boys with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and/or conduct disorder (n = 19) and in controls with no psychiatric condition (n = 11). The task proceeded in blocks during which participants received either (a) monetary incentives for correct responses or (b) no rewards for correct responses. Controls exhibited striatal activation only during reward, shifting to anterior cingulate activation during nonreward. In contrast, externalizing adolescents exhibited striatal activation during both reward and nonreward. Externalizing psychopathology appears to be characterized by deficits in processing the omission of predicted reward, which may render behaviors that are acquired through environmental contingencies difficult to extinguish when those contingencies change.

Structural brain alterations","Although previous studies found that aberrations in gray matter volume (GMV) and global functional connectivity density (gFCD) are important characteristics of schizophrenia, to the best of our knowledge no study to date has investigated the associations between the spatial distribution patterns of GMV and gFCD alterations. We investigated pattern changes in gFCD and GMV among patients with schizophrenia and their associated spatial distributions. Ninety-five patients with schizophrenia and 93 matched healthy controls underwent structural and resting-state functional MRI scanning to assess gFCD and GMV. We found that gFCD increased in the subcortical regions (caudate, pallidum, putamen, and thalami) and limbic system (left hippocampus and parahippocampus), and decreased in the posterior parieto-occipito-temporal cortices (postcentral gyri, occipital cortex, temporo-occipital conjunction, and inferior parietal lobule), in patients with schizophrenia. By contrast, we found decreased GMV in brain regions including the frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, cingulate cortices, and the insular, striatum, thalamus in these patients. Increased gFCD primarily occurred in subcortical regions including the basal ganglia and some regions of the limbic system. Decreased gFCD appeared primarily in the cortical regions. There were no statistically significant correlations between changes in gFCD and GMV, and their spatial distribution patterns, in different regions. Our findings indicate that gFCD and GMV are both perturbed in multiple brain regions in schizophrenia. gFCD and GMV consistently decreased in the cortical regions, with the exception of the Supplementary Motor Area (SMA). However, in the sub-cortical regions, the alterations of gFCD and GMV showed the opposite pattern, with increased gFCD and decreased GMV simultaneously observed in these regions. Overall, our findings suggest that structural and functional alterations appear to contribute independently to the neurobiology of schizophrenia. ",
pmid_31139470,Repeated Working Memory Training Improves Task Performance and Neural Efficiency in Multiple Sclerosis Patients and Healthy Controls.,,"To explore the effectiveness of a specific working memory (WM) training program in MS patients and healthy controls (HC). 29 MS patients and 29 matched HC were enrolled in the study. MS and HC were randomly split into two groups: nontraining groups (15HC/14 MS) and training groups (14 HC/15 MS). Training groups underwent adaptive n-back training (60 min/day; 4 days). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to monitor brain activity during n-back performance (conditions: 0-back, 2-back, and 3-back) at 3 time points: (1) baseline, (2) post-training (+7days), and (3) follow-up (+35days). In post-training and follow-up fMRI sessions, trained groups (HC and MS patients) exhibited significant reaction time (RT) reductions and increases in Correct Responses (CRs) during 2-back and 3-back performance. This improvement of task performance was accompanied by a decrease in brain activation in the WM frontoparietal network. The two effects were significantly correlated. After WM training, both cognitively preserved MS patients and HC participants showed task performance improvement made possible by neuroplastic processes that enhanced neural efficiency. ",
pmid_25731172,A motor cortex circuit for motor planning and movement.,,"Activity in motor cortex predicts specific movements seconds before they occur, but how this preparatory activity relates to upcoming movements is obscure. We dissected the conversion of preparatory activity to movement within a structured motor cortex circuit. An anterior lateral region of the mouse cortex (a possible homologue of premotor cortex in primates) contains equal proportions of intermingled neurons predicting ipsi- or contralateral movements, yet unilateral inactivation of this cortical region during movement planning disrupts contralateral movements. Using cell-type-specific electrophysiology, cellular imaging and optogenetic perturbation, we show that layer 5 neurons projecting within the cortex have unbiased laterality. Activity with a contralateral population bias arises specifically in layer 5 neurons projecting to the brainstem, and only late during movement planning. These results reveal the transformation of distributed preparatory activity into movement commands within hierarchically organized cortical circuits. ",

Tool
aSMG","The neural bases of haptically guided interactions with tools are largely unknown. Whereas in the visual domain there is clear evidence for left lateralization of the networks underlying the guidance of actions involving tools, comparable evidence in haptic modality is missing. Therefore, we examined whether the temporo-parieto-frontal networks responsive to interactions with tools also support haptically guided functional grasping. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity while, in the absence of vision, 21 right-handed participants performed the following tasks with either their dominant or non-dominant hands: haptic exploration of real 3-D tools or size-matched control objects, subsequent planning of functionally appropriate grasps of tools and most convenient grasps of non-tools, and the resulting grasp execution. As predicted, haptic exploration of tools (vs. non-tools) was associated with significant asymmetrical/left-lateralized increases of activity in temporo-parieto-frontal networks. While grasp planning did not reveal differences between tools and control objects, the execution of functional grasping of tools (as compared to control grasps) re-recruited mainly dorsal cortical regions engaged earlier during the exploration phase. These results demonstrate that haptically guided grasping of tools invokes only subsets of cortical regions typically associated with tool-directed actions. They also call for a re-interpretation of what we assumed would be happening during the exploration phase, as this early stage of processing most likely included preliminary grasp planning. After all, the requisite integration of structural and conceptual tool features, as well as relevant action knowledge mediated at the neuronal level by the temporo-parietal projections in the early stage of processing, is not then critical for the execution of the preprogrammed functional grasp.

pmid_21664605,Methylphenidate normalizes frontocingulate underactivation during error processing in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.,,"Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have deficits in performance monitoring often improved with the indirect catecholamine agonist methylphenidate (MPH). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the effects of single-dose MPH on activation of error processing brain areas in medication-naive boys with ADHD during a stop task that elicits 50% error rates. Twelve medication-naive boys with ADHD were scanned twice, under either a single clinical dose of MPH or placebo, in a randomized, double-blind design while they performed an individually adjusted tracking stop task, designed to elicit 50% failures. Brain activation was compared within patients under either drug condition. To test for potential normalization effects of MPH, brain activation in ADHD patients under either drug condition was compared with that of 13 healthy age-matched boys. During failed inhibition, boys with ADHD under placebo relative to control subjects showed reduced brain activation in performance monitoring areas of dorsomedial and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortices, thalamus, cingulate, and parietal regions. MPH, relative to placebo, upregulated activation in these brain regions within patients and normalized all activation differences between patients and control subjects. During successful inhibition, MPH normalized reduced activation observed in patients under placebo compared with control subjects in parietotemporal and cerebellar regions. MPH normalized brain dysfunction in medication-naive ADHD boys relative to control subjects in typical brain areas of performance monitoring, comprising left ventrolateral and dorsomedial frontal and parietal cortices. This could underlie the amelioration of MPH of attention and academic performance in ADHD. ",
pmid_16275810,Functional neuroanatomical substrates of altered reward processing in major depressive disorder revealed by a dopaminergic probe.,,"The pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) includes disturbances in several neuroanatomical substrates and neurotransmitter systems. The challenge is to elucidate the brain mechanisms of MDD behavioral symptoms, chiefly those of anhedonia. To visualize the neuroanatomical substrates implicated in altered reward processing in MDD, using functional magnetic resonance imaging in combination with a dopaminergic probe (a 30-mg dose of oral dextroamphetamine sulfate) to stimulate the brain reward system; and to test the hypothesis that a hypersensitive response to dextroamphetamine in MDD involves the prefrontal cortex and the striatum. Among subjects with MDD and healthy control subjects, functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected before and after single-blind administration of dextroamphetamine. Subjects were recruited through local newspaper advertisements and by word of mouth. Twelve depressed subjects (mean age, 34.83 years; male-female ratio, 6:6) met criteria for MDD according to the DSM-IV, were not taking antidepressants, and had no comorbid Axis I disorders. Twelve control subjects (mean age, 29.33 years; male-female ratio, 5:7) were healthy volunteers without a history of Axis I disorders. Functional magnetic resonance imaging blood oxygen level-dependent activation was measured during a controlled task, and dextroamphetamine-induced subjective effects were assessed using the Addiction Research Center Inventory. Subjects with MDD had a hypersensitive response to the rewarding effects of dextroamphetamine (2-fold increase; t(21) = 2.74, P = .01), with altered brain activation in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex and the caudate and putamen (F(1,44) = 11.93, P = .001). Dopamine-related neuroanatomical substrates are involved in altered reward processing in MDD, shedding light on the neurobiology of the anhedonic symptoms in MDD and suggesting these substrates as future therapeutic targets.

Cognitively normal older adults were randomly assigned to either the TCC or control (CON) group. Over a 12-week period, the TCC group received three 60-min sessions of Yang-style TCC training weekly, whereas the CON group only received one telephone consultation biweekly and did not alter their life style.

pmid_22198972,A reward prediction error for charitable donations reveals outcome orientation of donators.,,"The motives underlying prosocial behavior, like charitable donations, can be related either to actions or to outcomes. To address the neural basis of outcome orientation in charitable giving, we asked 33 subjects to make choices affecting their own payoffs and payoffs to a charity organization, while being scanned by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We experimentally induced a reward prediction error (RPE) by subsequently discarding some of the chosen outcomes. Co-localized to a nucleus accumbens BOLD signal corresponding to the RPE for the subject's own payoff, we observed an equivalent RPE signal for the charity's payoff in those subjects who were willing to donate. This unique demonstration of a neuronal RPE signal for outcomes exclusively affecting unrelated others indicates common brain processes during outcome evaluation for selfish, individual and nonselfish, social rewards and strongly suggests the effectiveness of outcome-oriented motives in charitable giving.

pmid_19589502,A functional magnetic resonance imaging study of deliberate emotion regulation in resilience and posttraumatic stress disorder.,,"Sexual violence is an important public health problem in the United States, with 13% to 26% of women reporting a history of sexual assault. While unfortunately common, there is substantial individual variability in response to sexual assault. Approximately half of rape victims develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), while others develop no psychopathology (e.g., trauma-exposed non-PTSD). In this project, we examined the neural mechanisms underlying differences in response to sexual violence, focusing specifically on the deliberate modification of emotional responses to negative stimuli. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response, we examined the neural circuitry underlying effortful modification of emotional responses to negative pictures in 42 women: 14 with PTSD after sexual trauma, 14 with no psychiatric diagnosis after sexual trauma, and 14 nontraumatized control subjects. In response to deliberate attempts to downregulate emotional responses, nontraumatized healthy control subjects were more successful than either trauma-exposed group (PTSD or non-PTSD) in downregulating responses to the negative pictures as measured by subjective rating and BOLD response in regions of prefrontal cortex (PFC). In contrast, after deliberate attempts to upregulate emotional responses, regions of PFC were activated by trauma-exposed non-PTSD subjects more than by healthy control subjects or PTSD subjects. Successful downregulation of emotional responses to negative stimuli appears to be impaired by trauma exposure. In contrast, the ability to upregulate emotional responses to negative stimuli may be a protective factor in the face of trauma exposure and associated with resilience. ",

Wnt-10a","Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy is proven to attenuate neuropathic pain in rodents. The goal of the present study was to determine the potential involvement of the Kindlin-1/Wnt-10a signaling pathway during astrocyte activation and inflammation in a rodent model of neuropathic pain. Rats were assigned into sham operation, chronic constriction injury (CCI), and CCI + HBO treatment groups. Neuropathic pain developed in rats following CCI of the sciatic nerve. Rats in the CCI + HBO group received HBO treatment for five consecutive days beginning on postoperative day 1. The mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) and the thermal withdrawal latency (TWL) tests were performed to determine mechanical and heat hypersensitivity of animals, respectively. Kindlin-1, Wnt-10a and β-catenin protein expression was examined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α was also determined by ELISA. Our findings demonstrated that HBO treatment significantly suppressed mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in the CCI neuropathic pain model in rats. HBO therapy significantly reversed the up-regulation of Kindlin-1 in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), spinal cord, and hippocampus of CCI rats. CCI-induced astrocyte activation and increased levels of TNF-α were efficiently reversed by HBO (P < 0.05 vs. CCI). HBO also reversed Wnt-10a up-regulation induced by CCI in the DRG, spinal cord, and hippocampus (P < 0.05 vs. CCI). Our findings demonstrate that HBO attenuated CCI-induced rat neuropathic pain and inflammatory responses, possibly through regulation of the Kindlin-1/Wnt-10a signaling pathway. ",

Twenty-six patients with schizophrenia and 26 age and gender matched healthy controls; 23 unaffected first-degree relatives and 23 matched healthy controls were recruited to complete a Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task and an Affective Incentive Delay (AID) task in a 3-Tesla MRI scanner. Hypoactivation in the dorsal striatum when anticipating monetary incentives were found in patients with schizophrenia and their unaffected first-degree relatives compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, patients with schizophrenia showed hyperactivation in the ventral striatum when receiving both monetary and affective incentives. These findings suggest that disorganized striatal function, regardless of incentive types, may be present in patients with schizophrenia and before the onset of illness in their first-degree unaffected relatives.

Our recent work has shown that visuospatial working-memory capacity predicts the rate of motor sequence learning and the length of motor chunks formed during explicit sequence learning in young adults. In the current study, we evaluate whether age-related deficits in working memory explain the reduced rate of motor sequence learning in older adults. We found that older adults exhibited a correlation between visuospatial working-memory capacity and motor sequence chunk length, as we observed previously in young adults. In addition, older adults exhibited an overall reduction in both working-memory capacity and motor chunk length compared with that of young adults. However, individual variations in visuospatial working-memory capacity did not correlate with the rate of learning in older adults. These results indicate that working memory declines with age at least partially explain age-related differences in explicit motor sequence learning. ",
pmid_25789314,Altered interhemispheric functional coordination in chronic tinnitus patients.,,"Purpose. Recent studies suggest that tinnitus may be due in part to aberrant callosal structure and interhemispheric interaction. To explore this hypothesis we use a novel method, voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC), to examine the resting-state interhemispheric functional connectivity and its relationships with clinical characteristics in chronic tinnitus patients. Materials and Methods. Twenty-eight chronic tinnitus patients with normal hearing thresholds and 30 age-, sex-, education-, and hearing threshold-matched healthy controls were included in this study and underwent the resting-state fMRI scanning. We computed the VMHC to analyze the interhemispheric functional coordination between homotopic points of the brain in both groups. Results. Compared to the controls, tinnitus patients showed significantly increased VMHC in the middle temporal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and superior occipital gyrus. In tinnitus patients, a positive correlation was found between tinnitus duration and VMHC of the uncus. Moreover, correlations between VMHC changes and tinnitus distress were observed in the transverse temporal gyrus, superior temporal pole, precentral gyrus, and calcarine cortex. Conclusions. These results show altered interhemispheric functional connectivity linked with specific tinnitus characteristics in chronic tinnitus patients, which may be implicated in the neuropathophysiology of tinnitus.

However, no microstructural white matter alterations have been found particularly in episodic or chronic migraine patients, and there is limited research focused on the comparison between these two groups of migraine patients. Fifty-one healthy controls, 55 episodic migraine patients and 57 chronic migraine patients were recruited and underwent brain T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI acquisition. Using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS), fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity and axial diffusivity were compared between the different groups. On the one hand, all migraine patients were compared against healthy controls. On the other hand, patients from each migraine group were compared between them and also against healthy controls. Correlation analysis between clinical features (duration of migraine in years, time from onset of chronic migraine in months, where applicable, and headache and migraine frequency, where applicable) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging measures was performed. Fifty healthy controls, 54 episodic migraine and 56 chronic migraine patients were finally included in the analysis. Significant decreased axial diffusivity (p < .05 false discovery rate and by number of contrasts corrected) was found in chronic migraine compared to episodic migraine in 38 white matter regions from the Johns Hopkins University ICBM-DTI-81 White-Matter Atlas. Significant positive correlation was found between time from onset of chronic migraine and mean fractional anisotropy in the bilateral external capsule, and negative correlation between time from onset of chronic migraine and mean radial diffusivity in the bilateral external capsule. These findings suggest global white matter structural differences between episodic migraine and chronic migraine. Patients with chronic migraine could present axonal integrity impairment in the first months of chronic migraine with respect to episodic migraine patients. White matter changes after the onset of chronic migraine might reflect a set of maladaptive plastic changes. ",

We aimed to explore functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) mechanism of acupuncture for aMCI. A randomized, controlled, single-blind research was performed. A total of 46 aMCI patients were randomly assigned into verum and sham acupuncture group, who received a total of 24 times treatments (3 times/week, 8 weeks). Clinical evaluation and fMRI scanning were performed at baseline and after treatment for all aMCI patients. The interaction effects and inter-group effects of regional homogeneity (ReHo) were performed using mixed effect models, and the correlations between clinical improvement and neuroimaging changes before and after verum acupuncture treatment were analyzed using Pearson correlations. As a result, interaction effects showed increased ReHo value in left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), increased functional connectivity between left DLPFC and left precuneus, and decreased functional connectivity between left DLPFC and left inferior temporal gyrus after verum acupuncture but inversely after sham acupuncture in the aMCI. Condition effects showed increased ReHo in right lingual gyrus, and bilateral post-central gyrus after verum and sham acupuncture in the aMCI. In addition, the changed Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores in verum acupuncture group were significantly correlated with changed ReHo values in left DLPFC. Together, our findings further confirmed that acupuncture could be used as a promising complementary therapy for aMCI by modulating function of left DLPFC to improve cognitive symptoms. ",

In the study, the diffusion-tensor imaging and resting-state functional MR imaging were performed in forty-two hemodialysis patients with ESRD and 42 healthy control subjects. Neuropsychological and laboratory tests were performed in all subjects. ALFF, fraction anisotropy (FA), and mean diffusivity (MD) values were compared between the two groups. Correlations between ALFF, FA or MD values, and clinical markers were analyzed. We found that ESRD patients exhibited significantly lower ALFF values in multiple areas, including medial frontal gyrus, limbic lobe, superior frontal gyrus, bilateral lingual gyri, occipital lobe, parahippocampal gyrus, precuneus, while increased ALFF values in medial frontal gyrus than healthy controls. FA values were decreased in medial frontal gyrus, parietal lobe, and left precuneus regions in the ESRD group compared with controls. Importantly, FA for the frontal and parietal lobes was negatively associated with the dialysis duration of ESRD patients, ALFF z-scores for the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) were positively correlated with the dialysis duration of ESRD patients and Serum calcium of ESRD patients negatively correlated with FA values in the frontal and parietal lobes ( Our study revealed that both impaired brain structure and function in ESRD patients with routine hemodialysis distributed mainly in the parietal, temporal, and frontal lobes. ESRD patients have cognitive impairment and declined memory ability. Serum calcium and dialysis duration might be associated with the impairment of brain structure and function in patients with ESRD.

pmid_23029492,Neural substrates for semantic memory of familiar songs: is there an interface between lyrics and melodies?,,"Findings on song perception and song production have increasingly suggested that common but partially distinct neural networks exist for processing lyrics and melody. However, the neural substrates of song recognition remain to be investigated. The purpose of this study was to examine the neural substrates involved in the accessing ""song lexicon"" as corresponding to a representational system that might provide links between the musical and phonological lexicons using positron emission tomography (PET). We exposed participants to auditory stimuli consisting of familiar and unfamiliar songs presented in three ways: sung lyrics (song), sung lyrics on a single pitch (lyrics), and the sung syllable 'la' on original pitches (melody). The auditory stimuli were designed to have equivalent familiarity to participants, and they were recorded at exactly the same tempo. Eleven right-handed nonmusicians participated in four conditions: three familiarity decision tasks using song, lyrics, and melody and a sound type decision task (control) that was designed to engage perceptual and prelexical processing but not lexical processing. The contrasts (familiarity decision tasks versus control) showed no common areas of activation between lyrics and melody. This result indicates that essentially separate neural networks exist in semantic memory for the verbal and melodic processing of familiar songs. Verbal lexical processing recruited the left fusiform gyrus and the left inferior occipital gyrus, whereas melodic lexical processing engaged the right middle temporal sulcus and the bilateral temporo-occipital cortices. Moreover, we found that song specifically activated the left posterior inferior temporal cortex, which may serve as an interface between verbal and musical representations in order to facilitate song recognition.

pain","Psychopathic traits are associated with increases in antisocial behaviors such as aggression and are characterized by reduced empathy for others' distress. This suggests that psychopathic traits may also impair empathic pain sensitivity. However, whether psychopathic traits affect responses to the pain of others versus the self has not been previously assessed. We used whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure neural activation in 14 adolescents with oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder and psychopathic traits, as well as 21 healthy controls matched on age, gender, and intelligence. Activation in structures associated with empathic pain perception was assessed as adolescents viewed photographs of pain-inducing injuries. Adolescents imagined either that the body in each photograph was their own or that it belonged to another person. Behavioral and neuroimaging data were analyzed using random-effects analysis of variance. Youths with psychopathic traits showed reduced activity within regions associated with empathic pain as the depicted pain increased. These regions included rostral anterior cingulate cortex, ventral striatum (putamen), and amygdala. Reductions in amygdala activity particularly occurred when the injury was perceived as occurring to another. Empathic pain responses within both amygdala and rostral anterior cingulate cortex were negatively correlated with the severity of psychopathic traits as indexed by PCL:YV scores. Youths with psychopathic traits show less responsiveness in regions implicated in the affective response to another's pain as the perceived intensity of this pain increases. Moreover, this reduced responsiveness appears to predict symptom severity. ",

Diabetic vitreous hemorrhage

Regional homogeneity
Resting state","Diabetic vitreous hemorrhage (DVH) is a common complication of diabetes. While the diagnostic methods nowadays only concentrate on the eye injury in DVH patients, whether DVH leads to abnormalities of other visual systems, including the eye, the visual cortex, and other brain regions, remains unknown. To explore the potential changes of brain activity in DVH using regional homogeneity (ReHo) and their relationships with clinical features. Thirty-one DVH patients and 31 matched healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. All subjects were examined by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The neural homogeneity in the brain region was estimated by ReHo method. Pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationships between average ReHo values and clinical manifestations in DVH patients. Compared with HCs, the ReHo values in the bilateral cerebellar posterior lobes, right superior (RS)/middle occipital gyrus (MOG), and bilateral superior frontal gyrus were significantly increased. In contrast, in the right insula, bilateral medial frontal gyri, and right middle frontal gyrus, the ReHo values were significantly decreased. Furthermore, we found that best-corrected visual acuity of the contralateral eye in patients with DVH presented a positive correlation with the mean ReHo value of the RS/MOG. We also found that depression score of the DVH group presented a negative correlation with the mean ReHo values of the right insula, bilateral medial frontal gyrus, and right middle frontal gyrus. We found that DVH may cause dysfunction in multiple brain areas, which may benefit the exploration of pathologic mechanisms in DVH patients. ",
pmid_25102926,Improving fluid intelligence with training on working memory: a meta-analysis.,,"Working memory (WM), the ability to store and manipulate information for short periods of time, is an important predictor of scholastic aptitude and a critical bottleneck underlying higher-order cognitive processes, including controlled attention and reasoning. Recent interventions targeting WM have suggested plasticity of the WM system by demonstrating improvements in both trained and untrained WM tasks. However, evidence on transfer of improved WM into more general cognitive domains such as fluid intelligence (Gf) has been more equivocal. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis focusing on one specific training program, n-back. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for all n-back training studies with Gf outcome measures, a control group, and healthy participants between 18 and 50 years of age. In total, we included 20 studies in our analyses that met our criteria and found a small but significant positive effect of n-back training on improving Gf. Several factors that moderate this transfer are identified and discussed. We conclude that short-term cognitive training on the order of weeks can result in beneficial effects in important cognitive functions as measured by laboratory tests. ",

Sustained attention","The aim of this study was to investigate the neural basis of sustained attention, executive processing, and cognitive control in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to compare brain activation of 28 medication-naïve children with ADHD aged 7-12 years and 31 healthy controls during a cued continuous performance task (AX-CPT) in three stimulus context conditions (Go, NoGo, Lure). The children with ADHD showed increased activation in the left middle frontal gyrus, bilateral middle temporal gyrus, left precuneus and right cerebellum posterior lobe under the Lure condition compared to the controls. In the Lure condition, in contrast to the NoGo condition, an increased activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus, right medial frontal gyrus and right inferior parietal gyrus was observed in ADHD children. The results demonstrate that medication-naïve ADHD children show spatial and temporal abnormalities in neural activities involved in sustained attention and executive control. These findings show that there are distinct alternations in neural circuits related to sustained attention and executive control in children with ADHD, and further improve our understanding of the neural substrates of cognitive impairment in children with ADHD.

WM, white matter","Response inhibition is one of the executive functions impaired in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Increasing evidence indicates that altered functional and structural neural connectivity are part of the neurobiological basis of ADHD. Here, we investigated if adolescents with ADHD show altered functional connectivity during response inhibition compared to their unaffected siblings and healthy controls. Response inhibition was assessed using the stop signal paradigm. Functional connectivity was assessed using psycho-physiological interaction analyses applied to BOLD time courses from seed regions within inferior- and superior frontal nodes of the response inhibition network. Resulting networks were compared between adolescents with ADHD (N = 185), their unaffected siblings (N = 111), and controls (N = 125). Control subjects showed stronger functional connectivity than the other two groups within the response inhibition network, while subjects with ADHD showed relatively stronger connectivity between default mode network (DMN) nodes. Stronger connectivity within the response inhibition network was correlated with lower ADHD severity, while stronger connectivity with the DMN was correlated with increased ADHD severity. Siblings showed connectivity patterns similar to controls during successful inhibition and to ADHD subjects during failed inhibition. Additionally, siblings showed decreased connectivity with the primary motor areas as compared to both participants with ADHD and controls. Subjects with ADHD fail to integrate activation within the response inhibition network and to inhibit connectivity with task-irrelevant regions. Unaffected siblings show similar alterations only during failed stop trials, as well as unique suppression of motor areas, suggesting compensatory strategies. These findings support the role of altered functional connectivity in understanding the neurobiology and familial transmission of ADHD. ",
pmid_20360963,Subthalamic nucleus stimulation affects theory of mind network: a PET study in Parkinson's disease.,,"There appears to be an overlap between the limbic system, which is modulated by subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD), and the brain network that mediates theory of mind (ToM). Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of STN DBS on ToM of PD patients and to correlate ToM modifications with changes in glucose metabolism. To this end, we conducted (18)FDG-PET scans in 13 PD patients in pre- and post-STN DBS conditions and correlated changes in their glucose metabolism with modified performances on the Eyes test, a visual ToM task requiring them to describe thoughts or feelings conveyed by photographs of the eye region. Postoperative PD performances on this emotion recognition task were significantly worse than either preoperative PD performances or those of healthy controls (HC), whereas there was no significant difference between preoperative PD and HC. Conversely, PD patients in the postoperative condition performed within the normal range on the gender attribution task included in the Eyes test. As far as the metabolic results are concerned, there were correlations between decreased cerebral glucose metabolism and impaired ToM in several cortical areas: the bilateral cingulate gyrus (BA 31), right middle frontal gyrus (BA 8, 9 and 10), left middle frontal gyrus (BA 6), temporal lobe (fusiform gyrus, BA 20), bilateral parietal lobe (right BA 3 and right and left BA 7) and bilateral occipital lobe (BA 19). There were also correlations between increased cerebral glucose metabolism and impaired ToM in the left superior temporal gyrus (BA 22), left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 13 and BA 47) and right inferior frontal gyrus (BA 47). All these structures overlap with the brain network that mediates ToM. These results seem to confirm that STN DBS hinders the ability to infer the mental states of others and modulates a distributed network known to subtend ToM. ",
pmid_12556909,The Multi-Source Interference Task: validation study with fMRI in individual subjects.,,"Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) plays critical roles in cognitive processing, but group-averaging techniques have generally been required to obtain significant dACC activation in functional neuroimaging studies. Development of a task that reliably and robustly activates dACC within individuals is needed to improve imaging studies of neuropsychiatric disorders and localization of dACC in normal volunteers. By combining sources of cognitive interference (Stroop, Eriksen and Simon) with factors known to increase dACC activity, the Multi-Source Interference Task (MSIT) maximally taxes dACC, making it possible to reliably activate dACC within individuals using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In this study, eight normal adult volunteers performed the MSIT during fMRI. We compared fMRI responses and performance data between interference and control trials. Significant dACC activation (P < 1.7 x 10(-4)) was observed in all eight individuals and in the group-averaged fMRI data. In addition to dACC activation, group data also showed activation of presumably networked regions including dorsolateral prefrontal, premotor, and parietal cortices. The MSIT's reaction time interference effect (overall mean 312 +/- 61 ms) was up to 10 times greater than that of its component predecessors and temporally stable over hundreds of trials. The robustness, reliability and stability of the neuroimaging and performance data should make the MSIT a useful task with which to study normal human cognition and psychiatric pathophysiology. ",
pmid_17996854,Neural correlates associated with intermanual transfer of sensorimotor adaptation.,,"Investigations of intermanual transfer of learning have demonstrated that individuals can transfer acquired motor skills from one hand to the other. The purpose of the current study was to use fMRI to investigate the potential overlap of neural regions engaged during learning and at transfer of learning from the dominant arm to the non-dominant arm during sensorimotor adaptation. Participants performed a visuomotor adaptation joystick task where they adapted manual aiming movements to a 30 degrees rotation of the visual feedback display. They performed eleven blocks (24 trials/block) of right-hand adaptation before performing the task with their left hand (transfer). Participants showed a selective transfer of learning effect: prior right-hand practice led to reduced endpoint errors but not trajectory errors for the left hand. This is consistent with work showing that the right arm is specialized for trajectory control while the left is specialized for endpoint control [Sainburg, R.L., 2005. Handedness, Differential specializations for control of trajectory and position. Exerc Sport Sci Rev 33, 206-213.]. Early adaptation processes were associated with activation in frontal and parietal regions, including bilateral dorsal premotor cortex. At transfer, activation was seen in the temporal cortex as well as the right medial frontal gyrus and the middle occipital gyrus. These regions have been observed in other studies during the late phases of sensorimotor adaptation. Integrating these data with the existing literature, we suggest that the left dorsal premotor cortex contributes to trajectory control, while the left visual and temporal cortices contribute to endpoint control.

pmid_22840553,Abnormal amygdala and prefrontal cortex activation to facial expressions in pediatric bipolar disorder.,,"Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in pediatric bipolar disorder (BD) have reported greater amygdala and less dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activation to facial expressions compared to healthy controls. The current study investigates whether these differences are associated with the early or late phase of activation, suggesting different temporal characteristics of brain responses. A total of 20 euthymic adolescents with familial BD (14 male) and 21 healthy control subjects (13 male) underwent fMRI scanning during presentation of happy, sad, and neutral facial expressions. Whole-brain voxelwise analyses were conducted in SPM5, using a three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with factors group (BD and healthy control [HC]), facial expression (happy, sad, and neutral versus scrambled), and phase (early and late, corresponding to the first and second half of each block of faces). There were no significant group differences in task performance, age, gender, or IQ. Significant activation from the main effect of group included greater DLPFC activation in the HC group, and greater amygdala/hippocampal activation in the BD group. The interaction of Group × Phase identified clusters in the superior temporal sulcus/insula and visual cortex, where activation increased from the early to late phase of the block for the BD but not the HC group. These findings are consistent with previous studies that suggest deficient prefrontal cortex regulation of heightened amygdala response to emotional stimuli in pediatric BD. Increasing activation over time in superior temporal and visual cortices suggests difficulty processing or disengaging attention from emotional faces in BD. ",
pmid_19815780,The visual perception of motion by observers with autism spectrum disorders: a review and synthesis.,,"Traditionally, psychological research on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has focused on social and cognitive abilities. Vision provides an important input channel to both of these processes, and, increasingly, researchers are investigating whether observers with ASD differ from typical observers in their visual percepts. Recently, significant controversies have arisen over whether observers with ASD differ from typical observers in their visual analyses of movement. Initial studies suggested that observers with ASD experience significant deficits in their visual sensitivity to coherent motion in random dot displays but not to point-light displays of human motion. More recent evidence suggests exactly the opposite: that observers with ASD do not differ from typical observers in their visual sensitivity to coherent motion in random dot displays, but do differ from typical observers in their visual sensitivity to human motion. This review examines these apparently conflicting results, notes gaps in previous findings, suggests a potentially unifying hypothesis, and identifies areas ripe for future research. ",
pmid_12615646,Hyperfamiliarity for unknown faces after left lateral temporo-occipital venous infarction: a double dissociation with prosopagnosia.,,"Right hemisphere dominance in face processing is well established and unilateral right inferior temporo-occipital damage can result in prosopagnosia. Here, we describe a 21-year-old right-handed woman with acute impairment in face recognition that selectively concerned unfamiliar faces, following a focal left lateral temporo-occipital venous infarct. She was severely impaired in discerning that unknown people seen in everyday life were unfamiliar, although she had no difficulty recognizing familiar people. Thus, she had no prosopagnosia, but abnormal 'hyperfamiliarity' for unknown faces. Her difficulty was not accompanied by delusions or deficits in discrimination, identification or memory for faces. Standard neuropsychological testing showed that her recognition of familiar faces was entirely normal. By contrast, her sense of personally knowing faces was severely impaired when unknown faces evoked weak signals of familiarity based on spurious cues, to the extent that she would misattribute fame to faces that were unknown but to which she had been incidentally exposed on a prior occasion. Priming experiments also revealed that, unlike normal subjects, she made familiarity judgements without accessing semantic identity representations. Moreover, in face recognition tests, she generally showed bias in that she relied more on right-hemisphere strategies to identify global traits and less on left-hemisphere processes compared with healthy subjects. This case provides novel evidence for a differential contribution of the two hemispheres to face recognition. Hyperfamiliarity for unknown faces might arise from an imbalance between reciprocal hemispheric functions in face recognition, with relative hypoactivation of left hemisphere processes but hyperactivation of right-hemisphere processes for retrieving stored associations about people, linking seen faces to representations of affective and personal relevance. Hence, abnormal bias in attributing some personal meaning to unknown faces could be evoked by spurious signals of familiarity based on irrelevant affective associations in the right hemisphere. ",
pmid_11034857,Prolonged reaction time to a verbal working memory task predicts increased power of posterior parietal cortical activation.,,"We used multislice functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the association between behavioral and neurophysiological measures of working memory task performance in 20 right-handed male healthy volunteers. Images were acquired over a 5-min period at 1.5 Tesla. We used a periodic design, alternating 30-s blocks of the ""n-back"" working memory task with 30-s blocks of a sensorimotor control task to activate verbal working memory systems. The power of functional response to the task was estimated by sinusoidal regression at each voxel. The relationship between power of fMRI response and mean reaction time over all 11 working memory trials was explored by multiple regression, with age and mean reaction time to the control task as covariates, at voxel and regional levels of analysis. All subjects were able to perform the n-back task accurately. A spatially distributed network was activated, including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, lateral premotor cortex, and supplementary motor area (SMA) in the frontal lobes. More posteriorly, there were major foci of activation in parietal and occipitoparietal cortex, precuneus, lingual, and fusiform gyri of the ventral occipital lobe, inferior temporal gyrus, and cerebellum. The power of functional response was positively correlated with reaction time in bilateral posterior parietal cortex (Talairach coordinates in x, y, z (mm) 35, -44, 37 and -32, -56, 42), indicating that subjects who found the task difficult, and responded with a slower reaction time, tended to activate these regions more powerfully. One interpretation of this regionally specific relationship between prolonged reaction time and increased power of posterior parietal activation is consistent with prior studies identifying similar areas of parietal cortex as the site of the phonological storage function in verbal working memory.

hyperscanning
neuroeconomics","Groups of humans routinely misassign value to complex future events, especially in settings involving the exchange of resources. If properly structured, experimental markets can act as excellent probes of human group-level valuation mechanisms during pathological overvaluations--price bubbles. The connection between the behavioral and neural underpinnings of such phenomena has been absent, in part due to a lack of enabling technology. We used a multisubject functional MRI paradigm to measure neural activity in human subjects participating in experimental asset markets in which endogenous price bubbles formed and crashed. Although many ideas exist about how and why such bubbles may form and how to identify them, our experiment provided a window on the connection between neural responses and behavioral acts (buying and selling) that created the bubbles. We show that aggregate neural activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) tracks the price bubble and that NAcc activity aggregated within a market predicts future price changes and crashes. Furthermore, the lowest-earning subjects express a stronger tendency to buy as a function of measured NAcc activity. Conversely, we report a signal in the anterior insular cortex in the highest earners that precedes the impending price peak, is associated with a higher propensity to sell in high earners, and that may represent a neural early warning signal in these subjects. Such markets could be a model system to understand neural and behavior mechanisms in other settings where emergent group-level activity exhibits mistaken belief or valuation. ",
pmid_20661837,Spontaneous and intentional trait inferences recruit a common mentalizing network to a different degree: spontaneous inferences activate only its core areas.,,"This fMRI study analyzes inferences on other persons' traits, whereby half of the participants were given spontaneous (""read"") instructions while the other half were given intentional (""infer the person's trait"") instructions. Several sentences described the behavior of a target person from which a strong trait could be inferred (trait diagnostic) or not (trait nondiagnostic). A direct contrast between spontaneous and intentional instructions revealed no significant differences, indicating that the same social mentalizing network was recruited. There was, however, a difference with respect to different brain areas that passed the significance threshold, suggesting that this common network was recruited to a different degree. Specifically, spontaneous inferences significantly recruited only core mentalizing areas, including the temporo-parietal junction and medial prefrontal cortex, whereas intentional inferences additionally recruited other brain areas, including the (pre)cuneus, superior temporal sulcus, temporal poles, and parts of the premotor and parietal cortex. These results suggest that intentional instructions invite observers to think more about the material they read, and consider it in many ways besides its social impact. Future research on the neurological underpinnings of trait inference might profit from the use of spontaneous instructions to get purer results that involve only the core brain areas in social judgment.

pmid_17548160,Differential engagement of anterior cingulate and adjacent medial frontal cortex in adept meditators and non-meditators.,,"This study investigated differences in brain activation during meditation between meditators and non-meditators. Fifteen Vipassana meditators (mean practice: 7.9 years, 2h daily) and fifteen non-meditators, matched for sex, age, education, and handedness, participated in a block-design fMRI study that included mindfulness of breathing and mental arithmetic conditions. For the meditation condition (contrasted to arithmetic), meditators showed stronger activations in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex bilaterally, compared to controls. Greater rostral anterior cingulate cortex activation in meditators may reflect stronger processing of distracting events. The increased activation in the medial prefrontal cortex may reflect that meditators are stronger engaged in emotional processing. ",
pmid_21195392,Neuronal correlates of cognitive reappraisal in borderline patients with affective instability.,,"Borderline personality disorder has been characterized by enhanced emotional reactivity and deficient emotion regulation in behavioral and functional imaging studies. We aimed to validate patients' difficulties in the cognitive regulation of negative emotions and investigated if emotion regulation deficits are restricted to the decrease of negative emotions. A cognitive reappraisal paradigm was used and hence a regulation strategy that is typically applied in cognitive-behavioral therapy. Fifteen unmedicated female borderline patients with affective instability and 15 healthy female control subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during a delayed reappraisal paradigm. Hemodynamic responses were measured in response to aversive pictures in an initial viewing phase and a subsequent reappraisal phase with three different conditions: decreasing, increasing, and maintaining the initial emotional reaction. Patients demonstrated enhanced activation of left amygdala and right insula during the initial viewing of aversive stimuli. During attempting to decrease the initial emotional reaction, patients showed attenuated activation of the left orbitofrontal cortex and increased activation of the bilateral insula. The attempt to increase negative emotions resulted in enhanced activity in amygdala and insula, whereas no group differences were found. The results point to the role of two distinguishable processes of emotional difficulties in borderline personality disorder: enhanced emotional reactivity as well as deficits of voluntarily decreasing aversive emotions by means of cognitive reappraisal. The results suggest the neuronal substrate of deficits in explicit emotion regulation in the orbitofrontal cortex, which is in line with previous findings of a dysfunctional prefrontal network in borderline personality disorder.

pmid_17476000,Cortical plasticity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: motor imagery and function.,,"Cortical networks underlying motor imagery are functionally close to motor performance networks and can be activated by patients with severe motor disabilities. The aim of the study was to examine the longitudinal effect of progressive motoneuron degeneration on cortical representation of motor imagery and function in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The authors studied 14 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients and 15 healthy controls and a subgroup of 11 patients and 14 controls after 6 months with a grip force paradigm comprising imagery and execution tasks using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Motor imagery activated similar neural networks as motor execution in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients and healthy subjects in the primary motor (BA 4), premotor, and supplementary motor (BA 6) cortex. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients presented a stronger response within premotor and primary motor areas for imagery and execution compared to controls. After 6 months, these differences persisted with additional activity in the precentral gyrus in patients as well as in a frontoparietal network for motor imagery, in which activity increased with impairment. The findings suggest an ongoing compensatory process within the higher order motor-processing system of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients, probably to overcome loss of function in primary motor and motor imagery-specific networks. The increased activity in precentral and frontoparietal networks in motor imagery might be used to control brain-computer interfaces to drive communication and limb prosthetic devices in patients with loss of motor control such as severely disabled amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients in a locked-in-like state.

pmid_18400791,"Activity in face-responsive brain regions is modulated by invisible, attended faces: evidence from masked priming.",,"It is often assumed that neural activity in face-responsive regions of primate cortex correlates with conscious perception of faces. However, whether such activity occurs without awareness is still debated. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in conjunction with a novel masked face priming paradigm, we observed neural modulations that could not be attributed to perceptual awareness. More specifically, we found reduced activity in several classic face-processing regions, including the ""fusiform face area,"" ""occipital face area,"" and superior temporal sulcus, when a face was preceded by a briefly flashed image of the same face, relative to a different face, even when 2 images of the same face differed. Importantly, unlike most previous studies, which have minimized awareness by using conditions of inattention, the present results occurred when the stimuli (the primes) were attended. By contrast, when primes were perceived consciously, in a long-lag priming paradigm, we found repetition-related activity increases in additional frontal and parietal regions. These data not only demonstrate that fMRI activity in face-responsive regions can be modulated independently of perceptual awareness, but also document where such subliminal face-processing occurs (i.e., restricted to face-responsive regions of occipital and temporal cortex) and to what extent (i.e., independent of the specific image).

pmid_19847067,Training of the executive component of working memory: subcortical areas mediate transfer effects.,,"Several recent studies show that training can improve working memory (WM) performance. In this review, many issues related to WM training, such as neural basis, transfer effects, and age-related changes are addressed. We focus on our own studies investigating training on tasks taxing the executive updating function and discuss our findings in relation to results from other studies investigating training of the executive component of WM. The review confirms positive behavioral effects of training on working memory. The most common neural pattern following training is fronto-parietal activity decreases. Increases in sub-cortical areas are also frequently reported after training, and we suggest that such increases indicate changes in the underlying skill following training. Transfer effects are in general difficult to demonstrate. Some studies show that older adults increase their performance after WM training. However, transfer effects are small or nonexistent in old age. The main finding in this review is that sub-cortical areas seem to have a critical role in mediating transfer effects to untrained tasks after at least some forms of working memory training (such as updating).

We sought to examine the effects of divalproex on the structure, chemistry, and function of specific brain regions in children at high-risk for BD. A total of 24 children with mood dysregulation but not full BD, all offspring of a parent with BD, were treated with divalproex monotherapy for 12 weeks. A subset of 11 subjects and 6 healthy controls were scanned with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopy [MRS], and functional MRI [fMRI]) at baseline and after 12 weeks. There were no significant changes in amygdalar or cortical volume found over 12 weeks. Furthermore, no changes in neurometabolite ratios were found. However, we found the degree of decrease in prefrontal brain activation to correlate with degree of decrease in depressive symptom severity. Bipolar offspring at high risk for BD did not show gross morphometric, neurometabolite, or functional changes after 12 weeks of treatment with divalproex. Potential reasons include small sample size, short exposure to medications, or lack of significant neurobiological impact of divalproex in this particular population. ",

ultra-high-field neuroimaging","Musical memory is considered to be partly independent from other memory systems. In Alzheimer's disease and different types of dementia, musical memory is surprisingly robust, and likewise for brain lesions affecting other kinds of memory. However, the mechanisms and neural substrates of musical memory remain poorly understood. In a group of 32 normal young human subjects (16 male and 16 female, mean age of 28.0 ± 2.2 years), we performed a 7 T functional magnetic resonance imaging study of brain responses to music excerpts that were unknown, recently known (heard an hour before scanning), and long-known. We used multivariate pattern classification to identify brain regions that encode long-term musical memory. The results showed a crucial role for the caudal anterior cingulate and the ventral pre-supplementary motor area in the neural encoding of long-known as compared with recently known and unknown music. In the second part of the study, we analysed data of three essential Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in a region of interest derived from our musical memory findings (caudal anterior cingulate cortex and ventral pre-supplementary motor area) in 20 patients with Alzheimer's disease (10 male and 10 female, mean age of 68.9 ± 9.0 years) and 34 healthy control subjects (14 male and 20 female, mean age of 68.1 ± 7.2 years). Interestingly, the regions identified to encode musical memory corresponded to areas that showed substantially minimal cortical atrophy (as measured with magnetic resonance imaging), and minimal disruption of glucose-metabolism (as measured with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography), as compared to the rest of the brain. However, amyloid-β deposition (as measured with (18)F-flobetapir positron emission tomography) within the currently observed regions of interest was not substantially less than in the rest of the brain, which suggests that the regions of interest were still in a very early stage of the expected course of biomarker development in these regions (amyloid accumulation → hypometabolism → cortical atrophy) and therefore relatively well preserved. Given the observed overlap of musical memory regions with areas that are relatively spared in Alzheimer's disease, the current findings may thus explain the surprising preservation of musical memory in this neurodegenerative disease.

pmid_23122880,Alterations in the cortical thickness and the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder.,,"The core neuropsychological processes underlying post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have yet to be elucidated, and the association between anatomical and functional deficits in PTSD remains largely unknown. The aim of our study was to investigate the alterations in cortical thickness and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in PTSD patients resulting from motor vehicle accidents (MVCs), and to explore the association of cortical thickness and ALFF with the severity of PTSD symptoms. A total of 20 PTSD patients and 20 healthy controls were recruited and examined by high-resolution structural MRI combined with resting-state fMRI. The results showed significant decrease in cortical thickness in the left BA10, BA32 and BA45 and the right superior temporal gyrus in PTSD patients. The ALFF value in PTSD patients increased significantly in the left BA10 and BA32 and the right cerebellum. Linear regression revealed that decreased cortical thickness and increased ALFF in the BA10 were associated with the increased PTSD scores. These findings suggest that the structural integrity and resting-state function in the BA10 play an important role in the pathogenesis of PTSD. ",

social decision-making","Cocaine dependence frequently co-occurs with personality disorders, leading to increased interpersonal problems and greater burden of disease. Personality disorders are characterised by patterns of thinking and feeling that divert from social expectations. However, the comorbidity between cocaine dependence and personality disorders has not been substantiated by measures of brain activation during social decision-making. We applied functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare brain activations evoked by a social decision-making task-the Ultimatum Game-in 24 cocaine dependents with personality disorders (CDPD), 19 cocaine dependents without comorbidities and 19 healthy controls. In the Ultimatum Game participants had to accept or reject bids made by another player to split monetary stakes. Offers varied in fairness (in fair offers the proposer shares ~50 percent of the money; in unfair offers the proposer shares <30 percent of the money), and participants were told that if they accept both players get the money, and if they reject both players lose it. We contrasted brain activations during unfair versus fair offers and accept versus reject choices. During evaluation of unfair offers CDPD displayed lower activation in the insula and the anterior cingulate cortex and higher activation in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and superior frontal and temporal gyri. Frontal activations negatively correlated with emotion recognition. During rejection of offers CDPD displayed lower activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, striatum and midbrain. Dual diagnosis is linked to hypo-activation of the insula and anterior cingulate cortex and hyper-activation of frontal-temporal regions during social decision-making, which associates with poorer emotion recognition.

pmid_20128672,Working memory deficit in dyslexia: behavioral and FMRI evidence.,,"Dyslexia is a condition characterized by difficulty of reading given adequate intelligence and educational opportunities, primarily associated with a phonological processing deficit. In this study we show that dyslexic children also show a deficit in working memory compared to a control group, measured with fMRI. A working memory n-back task with three load levels was used. Behavioral data showed that the dyslexics had poorer performance compared to the controls. fMRI data showed that the dyslexics had reduced activation in the prefrontal and parietal cortices and the cerebellum compared with the controls. These results imply a working memory deficit in dyslexia. ",
pmid_12499414,Detecting residual cognitive function in persistent vegetative state.,,"Despite converging agreement about the definition of persistent vegetative state, recent reports have raised concerns about the accuracy of diagnosis in some patients, and the extent to which, in a selection of cases, residual cognitive functions may remain undetected. Objective assessment of residual cognitive function can be extremely difficult as motor responses may be minimal, inconsistent, and difficult to document in many patients, or may be undetectable in others because no cognitive output is possible. Here we describe strategies for using H(2)(15)O positron emission tomography activation studies to study covert cognitive processing in patients with a clinical diagnosis of persistent vegetative state. Three cases are described in detail. Of these, two exhibited clear and predicted regional cerebral blood flow responses during well-documented activation paradigms (face recognition and speech perception) which have been shown to produce specific, robust and reproducible activation patterns in normal volunteers. Some months after scanning, both patients made a significant recovery. In a third case, blood flow data were acquired during a speech perception task, although methodological difficulties precluded any systematic interpretation of the results. In spite of the multiple logistic and procedural problems involved, these results have major clinical and scientific implications and provide a strong basis for the systematic study of possible residual cognitive function in patients diagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative state.

Vision
Visuomotor control","Humans are more efficient when performing actions towards objects presented in the lower visual field (VF) than in the upper VF. The present study used slow event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine whether human brain areas implicated in action would show such VF preferences. Participants were asked to fixate one of four different positions allowing objects to be presented in the upper left, upper right, lower left or lower right VF. In some trials they reached to grasp the object with the right hand while in others they passively viewed the object. Crucially, by manipulating the fixation position, rather than the position of the objects, the biomechanics of the movements did not differ across conditions. The superior parieto-occipital cortex (SPOC) and the left precuneus, brain areas implicated in the control of reaching, were significantly more activated when participants grasped objects presented in the lower VF relative to the upper VF. Importantly, no such VF preferences were observed in these regions during passive viewing. This finding fits well with evidence from the macaque neurophysiology that neurons within visuomotor regions over-represent the lower VF relative to the upper VF and indicate that the neural responses within these regions may reflect a functional lower VF advantage during visually-guided actions.

pmid_21376543,The interacting role of media violence exposure and aggressive-disruptive behavior in adolescent brain activation during an emotional Stroop task.,,"Only recently have investigations of the relationship between media violence exposure (MVE) and aggressive behavior focused on brain functioning. In this study, we examined the relationship between brain activation and history of media violence exposure in adolescents, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Samples of adolescents with no psychiatric diagnosis or with disruptive behavior disorder (DBD) with aggression were compared to investigate whether the association of MVE history and brain activation is moderated by aggressive behavior/personality. Twenty-two adolescents with a history of aggressive behavior and diagnosis of either conduct disorder or oppositional-defiant disorder (DBD sample) and 22 controls completed an emotional Stroop task during fMRI. Primary imaging results indicated that controls with a history of low MVE demonstrated greater activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus and rostral anterior cingulate during the violent word condition. In contrast, in adolescents with DBD, those with high MVE exhibited decreased activation in the right amygdala, compared with those with low MVE. These findings are consistent with research demonstrating the importance of fronto-limbic structures for processing emotional stimuli, and with research suggesting that media violence may affect individuals in different ways depending on the presence of aggressive traits.

resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging","Previous studies have implied a key role for the prefrontal cortex in the antidepressive effect of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). However, there is still ubiquitous inconsistency across these studies, partly due to several confounding effects induced by the use of different samples. Studies with independent samples are necessary for validations to minimize confounding effects. In the current study, resting-state magnetic resonance imaging of 84 participants was collected using two scanners and two types of scanning parameters. One sample consisted of 28 patients and 23 healthy controls, and the other sample consisted of 33 patients. The local activity (indexed by the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations) and functional connectivity were used to examine functional plasticity in the two independent samples before and after ECT. Both samples showed increased local activity of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and enhanced connectivity of the DMPFC with the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) following ECT. The enhanced connectivity between the DMPFC and PCC was positively associated with clinical improvement for both samples. These findings provide relatively strong evidence to support the functional plasticity of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and reorganization by ECT. The functional plasticity of the DMPFC-PCC may underlie the antidepressive effect of ECT. ",

However, detailed cerebral morphological changes remain unclear in youths with IGD. In the current study, our aim was to investigate cortical morphology and further explore the relationship between the cortical morphology and symptom severity in male youths with IGD. Forty-eight male youths with IGD and 32 age- and education-matched normal controls received magnetic resonance imaging scans. We employed a recently proposed surface-based morphometric approach for the measurement of cortical thickness (CT). We found that youths with IGD showed increased CT in the bilateral insulae and the right inferior temporal gyrus. Moreover, significantly decreased CT were found in several brain areas in youths with IGD, including the bilateral banks of the superior temporal sulci, the right inferior parietal cortex, the right precuneus, the right precentral gyrus, and the left middle temporal gyrus. Additionally, youths with IGD demonstrated a significantly positive correlation between the left insular CT and symptom severity. Our data provide evidence for the finding of abnormal CT in distributed cerebral areas and support the notion that altered structural abnormalities observed in substance addiction are also manifested in IGD. Such information extends current knowledge about IGD-related brain reorganization and could help future efforts in identifying the role of insula in the disorder. ",

reappraisal","Effective regulation of negative affective states has been associated with mental health. Impaired regulation of negative affect represents a risk factor for dysfunctional coping mechanisms such as drug use and thus could contribute to the initiation and development of problematic substance use. This study investigated behavioral and neural indices of emotion regulation in regular marijuana users (n = 23) and demographically matched nonusing controls (n = 20) by means of an fMRI cognitive emotion regulation (reappraisal) paradigm. Relative to nonusing controls, marijuana users demonstrated increased neural activity in a bilateral frontal network comprising precentral, middle cingulate, and supplementary motor regions during reappraisal of negative affect (P < 0.05, FWE) and impaired emotion regulation success on the behavioral level (P < 0.05). Amygdala-focused analyses further revealed impaired amygdala downregulation in the context of decreased amygdala-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex functional connectivity (P < 0.05, FWE) during reappraisal in marijuana users relative to controls. Together, the present findings could reflect an unsuccessful attempt of compensatory recruitment of additional neural resources in the context of disrupted amygdala-prefrontal interaction during volitional emotion regulation in marijuana users. As such, impaired volitional regulation of negative affect might represent a consequence of, or risk factor for, regular marijuana use.

However, changes on the amplitudes of these LFOs remain largely unknown. Twenty-two medication-naive, first-episode patients with MDD and 19 age-, sex-, education-matched healthy controls were recruited. Resting-state fMRI was obtained by using an echo-planar imaging sequence and the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) was calculated to investigate the amplitude of LFOs in the resting state. Compared with control subjects, patients with MDD showed significantly decreased fALFF in right cerebellum posterior lobe, left parahippocampal gyrus and right middle frontal gyrus and increased fALFF in left superior occipital gyrus/cuneus (p<0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons). Further receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) analyses suggested that the alterations of fALFF in these regions might be used as markers to classify patients with MDD from healthy controls. These findings indicated LFOs abnormalities in MDD and the fALFF analysis might be a potential approach in further exploration of this disorder. ",

The network connectivity of auditory and non-auditory brain structures associated with emotion, memory and attention are functionally altered in debilitating tinnitus. Current studies suggest that tinnitus results from neuroplastic changes in the frontal and limbic temporal regions. The objective of this study was to use Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) to evaluate changes in the cerebral blood flow in tinnitus patients with normal hearing compared with healthy controls. Twenty tinnitus patients with normal hearing and 17 healthy controls, matched for sex, age and years of education, were subjected to Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography using the radiotracer ethylenedicysteine diethyl ester, labeled with Technetium 99 m (99 mTc-ECD SPECT). The severity of tinnitus was assessed using the ""Tinnitus Handicap Inventory"" (THI). The images were processed and analyzed using ""Statistical Parametric Mapping"" (SPM8). A significant increase in cerebral perfusion in the left parahippocampal gyrus (pFWE <0.05) was observed in patients with tinnitus compared with healthy controls. The average total THI score was 50.8+18.24, classified as moderate tinnitus. It was possible to identify significant changes in the limbic system of the brain perfusion in tinnitus patients with normal hearing, suggesting that central mechanisms, not specific to the auditory pathway, are involved in the pathophysiology of symptoms, even in the absence of clinically diagnosed peripheral changes.

pmid_16275141,fMRI activity in the medial temporal lobe during famous face processing.,,"The current event-related fMRI study examined the relative involvement of different parts of the medial temporal lobe (MTL), particularly the contribution of hippocampus and perirhinal cortex, in either intentional or incidental recognition of famous faces in contrast to unfamiliar faces. Our intention was to further explore the controversial contribution of MTL in the processing of semantic memory tasks. Subjects viewed a sequence of famous and unfamiliar faces. Two tasks were used encouraging attention to either fame or gender. In the fame task, the subjects were requested to identify the person when seeing his/her face and also to try to generate the name of this person. In the gender task, the subjects were asked to conduct a judgement of a person's gender when seeing his/her face. The visual processing was hence directed to gender and thereby expected to diminish attention to semantic information leading only to a ""passive"" registration of famous and non-familiar faces. Recognition of famous faces, in both contrasts, produced significant activations in the MTL. First, during the intentional recognition (the person identification task) increased activity was observed in the anterolateral part of left hippocampus, in proximity to amygdala. Second, during the incidental recognition of famous faces (the gender classification task), there was increased activity in the left posterior MTL with focus in the perirhinal cortex. Our results suggest that the hippocampus may be centrally involved in the intentional retrieval of semantic memories while the perirhinal cortex is associated with the incidental recognition of semantic information.

pmid_11378311,Cerebral gray and white matter reductions and clinical correlates in patients with early onset schizophrenia.,,"Few magnetic resonance imaging studies of schizophrenia have investigated brain tissue volumes and their relation to clinical symptoms in patients with an early age at illness onset. The twofold purpose of the study was to investigate both gray and white matter volumes in schizophrenic men with an early age at illness onset, and to determine whether clinical features correlated with tissue volume changes, using an automated voxel-by-voxel image analysis procedure. Twenty male patients with DSM-IV diagnoses of schizophrenia, and an early age at onset (m+/-SD=19+/-2) were compared with 20 age-matched health men. Magnetic resonance (1.5-T) scans were obtained with an Inversion-Recovery prepared fast gradient echo sequence enhancing gray and white matter contrast. Statistical Parametric Mapping was used for image segmentation and comparison. Patients had significant gray matter reductions in medial frontal gyri, left insula, left parahippocampus, and left fusiform gyrus; bilateral white matter reductions in frontal lobes, and increased total cerebrospinal fluid volume were also observed. Negative symptom scores were negatively related to white matter volumes in cingulate regions, and in the right internal capsule. These findings emphasize a pattern of left-hemisphere gray matter abnormalities, and suggest that fronto-paralimbic connectivity may be altered in men with early onset schizophrenia. ",
pmid_27897678,A Tale of Two Temporal Coding Strategies: Common and Dissociable Brain Regions Involved in Recency versus Associative Temporal Order Retrieval Strategies.,,"Numerous studies indicate the importance of the hippocampus to temporal order retrieval. However, behavioral studies suggest that there are different ways to retrieve temporal order information from encoded sequences, one involving an associative strategy (retrieving associations using neighboring items in a list) and another involving a recency strategy (determining which of two items came first). It remains unresolved, however, whether both strategies recruit the hippocampus or only associative strategies, consistent with the hippocampus's role in relational processing. To address this, we developed a paradigm in which we dissociated associative versus recency-based retrieval, involving the same stimulus presentation during retrieval. Associative retrieval involved an increase in RT (and decrease in performance) with greater distances between intervals, consistent with the need to retrieve intervening associations. Recency-based retrieval involved an increase in RT (and decrease in performance) with shorter distances between intervals, suggesting the use of a strength-based coding mechanism to retrieve information. We employed fMRI to determine the neural basis of the different strategies. Both strategies showed significant levels of hippocampal activation and connectivity that did not differ between tasks. In contrast, both univariate and connectivity pattern analyses revealed differences in extrahippocampal areas such as parietal and frontal cortices. A covariate analysis suggested that differences could not be explained by task difficulty alone. Together, these findings suggest that the hippocampus plays a role in both forms of temporal order retrieval, with neocortical networks mediating the different cognitive demands for associative versus recency-based temporal order retrieval.

Type 2 diabetes","Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with cognitive dysfunction and dementia. Brain imaging may provide important clues about underlying processes. This review focuses on the relationship between T2DM and brain abnormalities assessed with different imaging techniques: both structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including diffusion tensor imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, as well as positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography. Compared to people without diabetes, people with T2DM show slightly more global brain atrophy, which increases gradually over time compared with normal aging. Moreover, vascular lesions are seen more often, particularly lacunar infarcts. The association between T2DM and white matter hyperintensities and microbleeds is less clear. T2DM has been related to diminished cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity, particularly in more advanced disease. Diffusion tensor imaging is a promising technique with respect to subtle white matter involvement. Thus, brain imaging studies show that T2DM is associated with both degenerative and vascular brain damage, which develops slowly over the course of many years. The challenge for future studies will be to further unravel the etiology of brain damage in T2DM, and to identify subgroups of patients that will develop distinct progressive brain damage and cognitive decline.

pmid_17488207,Cortical regions involved in the generation of musical structures during improvisation in pianists.,,"Studies on simple pseudorandom motor and cognitive tasks have shown that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and rostral premotor areas are involved in free response selection. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate whether these brain regions are also involved in free generation of responses in a more complex creative behavior: musical improvisation. Eleven professional pianists participated in the study. In one condition, Improvise, the pianist improvised on the basis of a visually displayed melody. In the control condition, Reproduce, the participant reproduced his previous improvisation from memory. Participants were able to reproduce their improvisations with a high level of accuracy, and the contrast Improvise versus Reproduce was thus essentially matched in terms of motor output and sensory feedback. However, the Improvise condition required storage in memory of the improvisation. We therefore also included a condition FreeImp, where the pianist improvised but was instructed not to memorize his performance. To locate brain regions involved in musical creation, we investigated the activations in the Improvise-Reproduce contrast that were also present in FreeImp contrasted with a baseline rest condition. Activated brain regions included the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the presupplementary motor area, the rostral portion of the dorsal premotor cortex, and the left posterior part of the superior temporal gyrus. We suggest that these regions are part of a network involved in musical creation, and discuss their possible functional roles. ",

However, the manifestation of symptoms in dyslexia also includes impaired working memory (WM). The aim of this study was to investigate cortical activation related to verbal WM in dyslexic and normal readers aged around 13 years, controlling for phonological awareness processing. We used a modified WM n-back task where the participants remembered the first or last speech segment (phonemes) of the names of common objects shown as pictures. Dyslexic readers were impaired compared with the control group. Compared with the dyslexic readers, controls showed increased fMRI activation in the left superior parietal lobule and the right inferior prefrontal gyrus. Unlike controls, dyslexics did not show a significant increase in activation in WM areas with increased memory load. These findings provide support for a specific working memory deficit in dyslexic individuals. ",

We aimed to identify the neural substrates associated with emotional lability that were distinct from impairments in cognitive control and to assess the effects that stimulants have on those substrates. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess neural activity in adolescents with (N=15) and without (N=15) ADHD while they performed cognitive and emotional versions of the Stroop task that engage cognitive control and emotional processing, respectively. The participants with ADHD were scanned both on and off stimulant medication in a counterbalanced fashion. Controlling for differences in cognitive control, we found that during the emotional Stroop task, adolescents with ADHD as compared with controls demonstrated atypical activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Stimulants attenuated activity in the mPFC to levels comparable with controls. ",

There are many causes for low back pain, one being herniation of the discs of the lumbar spine. Treatment options are very limited. Why patients develop chronic pain especially when there is no known organic cause or when the offending painful stimulus has been removed remains poorly understood. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a technique that allows researchers to image which regions of the brain that are activated during motor, cognitive, and sensory experiences. Using fMRI to study pain has revealed new information about how the brain responds to painful stimuli and what regions of the brain are activated during pain. However, many of the paradigms used do not replicate the subject's pain or use painful stimuli in volunteers without pain. Also, following patients from their acute phase of pain to the chronic phase with serial fMRI has not been performed. In this study we developed a paradigm that would allow studying patients with low back pain and leg pain including lumbar radiculopathy to better mimic a clinical pain syndrome and to have a method of following patients with this type of pain over time.

We investigated this question using functional magnetic resonance imaging while subjects made donations to different charities. We found that the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal in ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) correlated with the subjective value of voluntary donations. Furthermore, the region of the VMPFC identified showed considerable overlap with regions that have been shown to encode for the value of basic rewards at the time of choice, suggesting that it might serve as a common valuation system during decision making. In addition, functional connectivity analyses indicated that the value signal in VMPFC might integrate inputs from networks, including the anterior insula and posterior superior temporal cortex, that are thought to be involved in social cognition.

In order to better understand potential differences in neurocognitive functioning among adolescents who use drugs, the current study aimed to identify the neural substrates of risky decision making that differ among adolescents who are primary users of alcohol or marijuana, primary users of both alcohol and marijuana, and controls who report primary use of neither drug. Participants completed the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Comparison of brain activation during risky decisions versus non-risky decisions across all subjects revealed greater response to risky decisions in dorsal anterior cinguate cortex (dACC), anterior insula, ventral striatum, and lateral prefrontal cortex. Group comparisons across non-using controls, primary marijuana, primary alcohol, and alcohol and marijuana users revealed several notable differences in the recruitment of brain regions. Adolescents who use both alcohol and marijauna show decreased response during risky decision making compared to controls in insula, striatum, and thalamus, and reduced differentiation of increasing risk in dACC, insula, striatum, and superior parietal lobe compared to controls. These results provide evidence of differential engagement of risky decision making circuits among adolescents with varying levels of alcohol and marijuana use, and may provide useful targets for longitudinal studies that explicitly address causality of these differences.

Whilst controlled experiments using functional brain imaging can give insightful snapshots of neuronal responses to relatively simplified stimuli, they cannot hope to mirror the challenges faced by the brain in the real world. However, trying to study the brain mechanisms supporting daily living represents a huge challenge. By combining functional neuroimaging, an accurate interactive virtual simulation of a bustling central London (UK), and a novel means of 'reading' participants' thoughts whilst they moved around the city, we ascertained the online neural correlates underpinning navigation in this real-world context. A complex choreography of neural dynamics was revealed comprising focal and distributed, transient and sustained brain activity. Our results provide new insights into the specific roles of individual brain areas, in particular the hippocampus, retrosplenial, and frontal cortices, as well as offering clues about how functional specialisations operate within dynamic brain systems.

pmid_18817740,Prefrontal-subcortical pathways mediating successful emotion regulation.,,"Although prefrontal cortex has been implicated in the cognitive regulation of emotion, the cortical-subcortical interactions that mediate this ability remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we identified a right ventrolateral prefrontal region (vlPFC) whose activity correlated with reduced negative emotional experience during cognitive reappraisal of aversive images. We then applied a pathway-mapping analysis on subcortical regions to locate mediators of the association between vlPFC activity and reappraisal success (i.e., reductions in reported emotion). Results identified two separable pathways that together explained approximately 50% of the reported variance in self-reported emotion: (1) a path through nucleus accumbens that predicted greater reappraisal success, and (2) a path through ventral amygdala that predicted reduced reappraisal success (i.e., more negative emotion). These results provide direct evidence that vlPFC is involved in both the generation and regulation of emotion through different subcortical pathways, suggesting a general role for this region in appraisal processes.

pmid_17331220,Differential cortical activity for precision and whole-hand visually guided grasping in humans.,,"Effective grasping involves the remarkable ability to implement multiple grasp configurations such as precision grip (PG; opposition between the index finger and thumb) and whole-hand grasp (WHG), depending on the properties of the object grasped (e.g. size, shape and weight). In the monkey brain, different groups of cells in the anterior-lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus (area AIP) are differentially active for various hand configurations during grasping of differently shaped objects. Visually guided grasping studies in humans suggest the anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) as the homologue of macaque area AIP, but leave unresolved the question of whether activity in human aIPS reflects the relationship between object size and grasp configuration, as in macaques. To address this issue, a human fMRI study was conducted in which objects were grasped with the right hand while object size was varied. The results indicated that the left aIPS was active when the subjects naturally adopted a PG to grasp the small object but showed a much weaker response when subjects naturally adopted a WHG to grasp the large object. The primary motor cortex and somatosensory cortices were active for both PG and WHG. Our results suggest that, in humans, the aIPS is centrally involved in determining the type of grasp. ",

However, depressed patients show impairments in this system. The present study investigated the neural correlates of implicit processing of happy facial expressions in depression and identified regions affected by antidepressant therapy. Two groups of subjects participated in a prospective study with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The patients were 19 medication-free subjects (mean age, 43.2 years) with major depression, acute depressive episode, unipolar subtype. The comparison group contained 19 matched healthy volunteers (mean age, 42.8 years). Both groups underwent fMRI scans at baseline (week 0) and at 8 weeks. Following the baseline scan, the patients received treatment with fluoxetine, 20 mg daily. The fMRI task was implicit affect recognition with standard facial stimuli morphed to display varying intensities of happiness. The fMRI data were analyzed to estimate the average activation (overall capacity) and differential response to variable intensity (dynamic range) in brain systems involved in processing facial affect. An attenuated dynamic range of response in limbic-subcortical and extrastriate visual regions was evident in the depressed patients, relative to the comparison subjects. The attenuated extrastriate cortical activation at baseline was increased following antidepressant treatment, and symptomatic improvement was associated with greater overall capacity in the hippocampal and extrastriate regions. Impairments in the neural processing of happy facial expressions in depression were evident in the core regions of affective facial processing, which were reversed following treatment. These data complement the neural effects observed with negative affective stimuli. ",
pmid_16290016,The neural correlates of direct and reflected self-knowledge.,,"Socrates said that in order to lead a balanced life one must, ""know thyself."" In two fMRI experiments, the present study examined the mechanisms mediating two ways in which the self can be known: through direct appraisals (i.e., an individual's own self-beliefs) and reflected appraisals (i.e., an individual's perception of how others view him or her). Experiment 1 examined the common and distinct neural bases of direct appraisals of the self, close others, and normative judgments of trait desirability. All three judgment types activated medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) to a similar degree. Experiment 2 examined the common and distinct neural bases of (1) direct appraisals of self, a close other or a non-close other, and (2) reflected appraisals made from the perspective of a close or a non-close other. Consistent with Experiment 1, all judgment types activated MPFC. Direct appraisals of the self as compared to others more strongly recruited MPFC and right rostrolateral PFC. Direct appraisals as compared to reflected appraisals recruited regions associated with a first-person perspective (posterior cingulate), whereas reflected as compared to direct appraisals recruited regions associated with emotion and memory (insula, orbitofrontal, and temporal cortex). These results support models suggesting that MPFC mediates meta-cognitive processes that may be recruited for direct and reflected self appraisals depending upon the demands of a specific task. ",
pmid_15722208,Learning-related fMRI activation associated with a rotational visuo-motor transformation.,,"The unique ability to learn transformed or altered visuo-motor relationships during motor learning (visuo-motor transformation learning) has engaged researchers for over a century. Compared to other forms of motor learning (e.g., sequence learning), little is known about plasticity in the cortical and/or subcortical systems involved. We used fMRI to isolate region-specific activation changes during the learning of a visuo-motor (joystick) task under a simple transformation (90 degree rotation of visual feedback). Distributed brain systems were engaged in the learning process. In particular, we found evidence of a learning-dependent transition from early activation of the posterior parietal cortex to later distributed cortico-subcortical-cerebellar responses (in the temporal and occipital cortices, basal ganglia, cerebellum and thalamus). The role of the posterior parietal cortex may relate specifically to the acquisition of the transformation, while that of the fusiform and superior temporal gyri may reflect higher level visual and visuo-spatial processing underlying consolidation. Learning-related increases in cerebellar responses are consistent with its proposed role in the acquisition of internal models of the motor apparatus. These learning-related changes suggest a role for interacting neural systems involving the co-operation of cortico-cortico, cortico-cerebellar and cortico-basal ganglia loops during visuo-motor transformation learning.

Based on current neural models of face perception, it was hypothesized that distinct extended networks of brain regions differentiate the perception of (a) novel faces, (b) novel faces associated with person-knowledge, (c) perceptually familiar faces and (d) familiar faces for which person-knowledge was learned. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment during which participants viewed faces experimentally manipulated to represent these different levels of familiarity. Results confirmed that distinct networks of brain regions, particularly the medial prefrontal cortex, underlie the perception of faces for which person-knowledge is available. ",

Behavioural responses (i.e. reaction time, RT; error rate, ER) and brain activity during correct, error and post-error trials, detected by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), were measured. Behaviourally, RT and ER were significantly higher in incongruent than in congruent trials and in switch than in repeat trials. The two groups did not differ in RT during correct trials, but adolescents had a significantly higher ER than adults. In line with similar RTs, brain responses during correct trials did not differ between groups, indicating that adolescents and adults engage the same cognitive control network to successfully overcome S-R interference or task switches. Interestingly, adolescents with stronger brain activation in the bilateral insulae during error trials and in fronto-parietal regions of the cognitive control network during post-error trials did have lower ERs. This indicates that those mid-adolescents who commit fewer errors are better at monitoring their performance, and after detecting errors are more capable of flexibly allocating further cognitive control resources. Although we did not detect a convincing neural correlate of the observed behavioural differences between adolescents and adults, the revealed interindividual differences in adolescents might at least in part be due to brain development.

pmid_21471559,Separating intra-modal and across-modal training effects in visual working memory: an fMRI investigation.,,"Working memory training is a useful tool to examine dissociations between specific working memory processes. Although current models propose a distinction between modality-specific working memory processes, to our knowledge no study has directly examined the effects of visual versus auditory working memory training. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate whether visual working memory processes can be trained specifically and whether those effects can be separated from across-modal training effects. We found decidedly larger training gains after visual working memory training compared with auditory or no training on a visual 2-back task. These effects were accompanied by specific training-related decreases in the right middle frontal gyrus arising from visual training only. Likewise, visual and auditory training led to decreased activations in the superior portion of the right middle frontal gyrus and the right posterior parietal lobule. We infer that the combination of effects resulted from increased neural efficiency of intra-modal (visual) processes on the one hand and of across-modal (general control) processes on the other hand. Therefore, visual processes of working memory can be trained specifically, and these effects can be functionally dissociated from alterations in general control processes common to both working memory trainings.

pmid_21430161,Anterior hippocampus and goal-directed spatial decision making.,,"Planning spatial paths through our environment is an important part of everyday life and is supported by a neural system including the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Here we investigated the precise functional roles of the components of this system in humans by using fMRI as participants performed a simple goal-directed route-planning task. Participants had to choose the shorter of two routes to a goal in a visual scene that might contain a barrier blocking the most direct route, requiring a detour, or might be obscured by a curtain, requiring memory for the scene. The participant's start position was varied to parametrically manipulate their proximity to the goal and the difference in length of the two routes. Activity in medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and left posterior parietal cortex was associated with detour planning, regardless of difficulty, whereas activity in parahippocampal gyrus was associated with remembering the spatial layout of the visual scene. Activity in bilateral anterior hippocampal formation showed a strong increase the closer the start position was to the goal, together with medial prefrontal, medial and posterior parietal cortices. Our results are consistent with computational models in which goal proximity is used to guide subsequent navigation and with the association of anterior hippocampal areas with nonspatial functions such as arousal and reward expectancy. They illustrate how spatial and nonspatial functions combine within the anterior hippocampus, and how these functions interact with parahippocampal, parietal, and prefrontal areas in decision making and mnemonic function.

Voxel based morphometry","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling illness with onset generally in childhood. OCD-youths differ from OCD-adults with regard to gender distribution, comorbidity patterns and treatment options. However, little is known about the neural correlate differences underpin those two populations. The current meta-analysis summarizes voxel based morphometry findings to elucidate whether differences of neural correlates exist between these two populations. Both OCD-youths and OCD-adults demonstrated greater striatal volume and smaller prefrontal grey matter volume (GMV). However, smaller GMV in left visual cortex was observed in OCD-youths only, while smaller GMV in anterior cingulate gyrus and greater GMV in cerebellum were demonstrated only in OCD-adults. Meta-regression showed greater GMV in left putamen was most prominent in samples with higher percentages of medicated OCD-adults. Our findings confirmed the most consistent GMV alterations in OCD were in prefrontal-striatal circuitry. Besides, other regions may involve at different developmental stages including deficits of visual cortex in OCD-youths and abnormalities of limbic-cerebellar circuit in OCD-adults. Medication effect may be more pronounced in the striatum, especially the putamen. ",
pmid_33658191,Durable memories and efficient neural coding through mnemonic training using the method of loci.,,"Mnemonic techniques, such as the method of loci, can powerfully boost memory. We compared memory athletes ranked among the world's top 50 in memory sports to mnemonics-naïve controls. In a second study, participants completed a 6-week memory training, working memory training, or no intervention. Behaviorally, memory training enhanced durable, longer-lasting memories. Functional magnetic resonance imaging during encoding and recognition revealed task-based activation decreases in lateral prefrontal, as well as in parahippocampal and retrosplenial cortices in both memory athletes and participants after memory training, partly associated with better performance after 4 months. This was complemented by hippocampal-neocortical coupling during consolidation, which was stronger the more durable memories participants formed. Our findings advance knowledge on how mnemonic training boosts durable memory formation through decreased task-based activation and increased consolidation thereafter. This is in line with conceptual accounts of neural efficiency and highlights a complex interplay of neural processes critical for extraordinary memory. ",

Such inferences violate rational norms and are part of the reasoning fallacy literature that provides interesting tasks to explore cognitive and neural basis of reasoning. To explore the functional neuroanatomy of the inclusion fallacy, we used a 2 × 2 factorial design, with factors for quantification (explicit and implicit) and response (fallacious and non-fallacious). It was found that a left fronto-temporal system, along with a superior medial frontal system, was specifically activated in response to fallacious responses consistent with a semantic biasing of judgment explanation. A right fronto-parietal system was specifically recruited in response to detecting conflict associated with the heightened fallacy condition. These results are largely consistent with previous studies of reasoning fallacy and support a multiple systems model of reasoning. ",
pmid_28775285,Lateral prefrontal activity as a compensatory strategy for deficits of cortical processing in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.,,"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most common neuropsychiatric disorder in childhood and is characterized by a delay of cortical maturation in frontal regions. In order to investigate interference control, which is a key function of frontal areas, a functional MRI study was conducted on 17 ADHD boys and 17 typically developing (TD) boys, while solving the multi source interference task (MSIT). This task consists of two conditions, a ""congruent condition"" and an ""incongruent condition"". The latter requires to inhibit information that interferes with task-relevant stimuli. Behavioral results showed that ADHD subjects committed more errors than TD children. In addition, TD children presented a larger MSIT effect -a greater difference in reaction times between the incongruent and the congruent conditions- than ADHD children. Associated to the MSIT effect, neuroimaging results showed a significant enhancement in the activation of the right lateral prefrontal cortex (rlPFC) in ADHD than in TD subjects. Finally, ADHD subjects presented greater functional connectivity between rlPFC and bilateral orbitofrontal cortex than the TD group. This difference in connectivity correlated with worse performance in both groups. Our results could reflect a compensatory strategy of ADHD children resulting from their effort to maintain an adequate performance during MSIT. ",
pmid_17210143,Resting-state functional connectivity in major depression: abnormally increased contributions from subgenual cingulate cortex and thalamus.,,"Positron emission tomography (PET) studies of major depression have revealed resting-state abnormalities in the prefrontal and cingulate cortices. Recently, fMRI has been adapted to examine connectivity within a specific resting-state neural network--the default-mode network--that includes medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices. The goal of this study was to examine resting-state, default-mode network functional connectivity in subjects with major depression and in healthy controls. Twenty-eight subjects with major depression and 20 healthy controls underwent 5-min fMRI scans while resting quietly. Independent component analysis was used to isolate the default-mode network in each subject. Group maps of the default-mode network were compared. A within-group analysis was performed in the depressed group to explore effects of depression refractoriness on functional connectivity. Resting-state subgenual cingulate and thalamic functional connectivity with the default-mode network were significantly greater in the depressed subjects. Within the depressed group, the length of the current depressive episode correlated positively with functional connectivity in the subgenual cingulate. This is the first study to explore default-mode functional connectivity in major depression. The findings provide cross-modality confirmation of PET studies demonstrating increased thalamic and subgenual cingulate activity in major depression. Further, the within-subject connectivity analysis employed here brings these previously isolated regions of hypermetabolism into the context of a disordered neural network. The correlation between refractoriness and subgenual cingulate functional connectivity within the network suggests that a quantitative, resting-state fMRI measure could be used to guide therapy in individual subjects. ",
pmid_23587692,Subregions of the human superior frontal gyrus and their connections.,,"The superior frontal gyrus (SFG) is located at the superior part of the prefrontal cortex and is involved in a variety of functions, suggesting the existence of functional subregions. However, parcellation schemes of the human SFG and the connection patterns of each subregion remain unclear. We firstly parcellated the human SFG into the anteromedial (SFGam), dorsolateral (SFGdl), and posterior (SFGp) subregions based on diffusion tensor tractography. The SFGam was anatomically connected with the anterior and mid-cingulate cortices, which are critical nodes of the cognitive control network and the default mode network (DMN). The SFGdl was connected with the middle and inferior frontal gyri, which are involved in the cognitive execution network. The SFGp was connected with the precentral gyrus, caudate, thalamus, and frontal operculum, which are nodes of the motor control network. Resting-state functional connectivity analysis further revealed that the SFGam was mainly correlated with the cognitive control network and the DMN; the SFGdl was correlated with the cognitive execution network and the DMN; and the SFGp was correlated with the sensorimotor-related brain regions. The SFGam and SFGdl were further parcellated into three and two subclusters that are well corresponding to Brodmann areas. These findings suggest that the human SFG consists of multiple dissociable subregions that have distinct connection patterns and that these subregions are involved in different functional networks and serve different functions. These results may improve our understanding on the functional complexity of the SFG and provide us an approach to investigate the SFG at the subregional level. ",
pmid_21854855,Evaluative and generative modes of thought during the creative process.,,"Psychological theories have suggested that creativity involves a twofold process characterized by a generative component facilitating the production of novel ideas and an evaluative component enabling the assessment of their usefulness. The present study employed a novel fMRI paradigm designed to distinguish between these two components at the neural level. Participants designed book cover illustrations while alternating between the generation and evaluation of ideas. The use of an fMRI-compatible drawing tablet allowed for a more natural drawing and creative environment. Creative generation was associated with preferential recruitment of medial temporal lobe regions, while creative evaluation was associated with joint recruitment of executive and default network regions and activation of the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex, insula, and temporopolar cortex. Executive and default regions showed positive functional connectivity throughout task performance. These findings suggest that the medial temporal lobe may be central to the generation of novel ideas and creative evaluation may extend beyond deliberate analytical processes supported by executive brain regions to include more spontaneous affective and visceroceptive evaluative processes supported by default and limbic regions. Thus, creative thinking appears to recruit a unique configuration of neural processes not typically used together during traditional problem solving tasks. ",

hippocampal subregions","Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), an effective antidepressive treatment, is frequently accompanied by cognitive impairment (predominantly memory), usually transient and self-limited. The hippocampus is a key region involved in memory and emotion processing, and in particular, the anterior-posterior hippocampal subregions has been shown to be associated with emotion and memory. However, less is known about the relationship between hippocampal-subregion alterations following ECT and antidepressant effects or cognitive impairments. Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) based on the seeds of hippocampal subregions were investigated in 45 pre- and post-ECT depressed patients. Structural connectivity between hippocampal subregions and corresponding functionally abnormal regions was also conducted using probabilistic tractography. Antidepressant effects and cognitive impairments were measured by the Hamilton Depressive Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Category Verbal Fluency Test (CVFT), respectively. Their relationships with hippocampal-subregions alterations were examined. After ECT, patients showed increased RSFC in the hippocampal emotional subregion (HIPe) with the left middle occipital gyrus (LMOG) and right medial temporal gyrus (RMTG). Decreased HDRS was associated with increased HIPe-RMTG RSFC (r = -0.316, p = 0.035) significantly and increased HIPe-LMOG RSFC at trend level (r = -0.283, p = 0.060). In contrast, the hippocampal cognitive subregion showed decreased RSFC with the bilateral angular gyrus, and was correlated with decreased CVFT (r = 0.418, p = 0.015 for left; r = 0.356, p = 0.042 for right). No significant changes were found in structural connectivity. The hippocampal-subregions functional alterations may be specially associated with the antidepressant and cognitive effects of ECT. ",
pmid_17728454,"Differential recruitment of the hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, and the human motion complex during path integration in humans.",,"Path integration, the ability to sense self-motion for keeping track of changes in orientation and position, constitutes a fundamental mechanism of spatial navigation and a keystone for the development of cognitive maps. Whereas animal path integration is predominantly supported by the head-direction, grid, and place cell systems, the neural foundations are not well understood in humans. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a virtual rendition of a triangle completion paradigm to test whether human path integration recruits a cortical system similar to that of rodents and nonhuman primates. Participants traveled along two legs of a triangle before pointing toward the starting location. In accordance with animal models, stronger right hippocampal activation predicted more accurate updating of the starting location on a trial-by-trial basis. Moreover, between-subjects fluctuations in response consistency were negatively correlated with bilateral hippocampal and medial prefrontal activation, and bilateral recruitment of the human motion complex (hMT+) covaried with individual path integration capability. Given that these effects were absent in a perceptual control task, the present study provides the first evidence that visual path integration is related to the dynamic interplay of self-motion processing in hMT+, higher-level spatial processes in the hippocampus, and spatial working memory in medial prefrontal cortex.

Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) studies analyze patterns of temporally coherent intrinsic brain activity in ""resting-state networks"" (RSNs). The default-mode network (DMN) has been of particular interest to depression research; however, a single RSN is unlikely to capture MDD pathophysiology in its entirety, and the DMN itself can be characterized by multiple RSNs. This, coupled with conflicting previous results, underscores the need for further research. Here, we measured RSFC in MDD by targeting RSNs overlapping with corticolimbic regions and further determined whether altered patterns of RSFC were restored with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). MDD patients exhibited hyperconnectivity between ventral striatum (VS) and the ventral default-mode network (vDMN), while simultaneously demonstrating hypoconnectivity with the anterior DMN (aDMN). ECT influenced this pattern: VS-vDMN hyperconnectivity was significantly reduced while VS-aDMN hypoconnectivity only modestly improved. RSFC between the salience RSN and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex was also reduced in MDD, but was not affected by ECT. Taken together, our results support a model of ventral/dorsal imbalance in MDD and further suggest that the VS is a key structure contributing to this desynchronization. ",
pmid_20381625,A neural wayfinding mechanism adjusts for ambiguous landmark information.,,"Objects along a route can serve as crucial landmarks that facilitate successful navigation. Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) evidence indicated that the human parahippocampal gyrus automatically distinguishes between objects placed at navigationally relevant (decision points) and irrelevant locations (non-decision points). This storage of relevant objects can provide a neural mechanism underlying successful navigation. However, only objects that actually support wayfinding need to be stored. Objects can also provide misleading information if similar objects appear at different locations along a route. An efficient mechanism needs to specifically adjust for ambiguous landmark information. We investigated this by placing identical objects twice in a virtual labyrinth at places with the same as well as with a different navigational relevance. Twenty right-handed volunteers moved through a virtual maze. They viewed the same object either at two different decision points, at two different non-decision points, or at a decision as well as at a non-decision point. Afterwards, event-related fMRI data were acquired during object recognition. Participants decided whether they had seen the objects in the maze or not. The results showed that activity in the parahippocampal gyrus was increased for objects placed at a decision and at a non-decision point as compared to objects placed at two non-decision points. However, ambiguous information resulting from the same object placed at two different decision points revealed increased activity in the right middle frontal gyrus. These findings suggest a neural wayfinding mechanism that differentiates between helpful and misleading information. ",
pmid_20630656,NMDA-receptor antagonist and morphine decrease CRPS-pain and cerebral pain representation.,,"A combination therapy of morphine with an NMDA-receptor antagonist might be more effective than morphine without a NMDA-receptor antagonist for the relief of neuropathic pain in patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). In order to test the efficacy of this combination therapy we performed a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study on patients suffering from CRPS of the upper extremity. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging during movement of the affected and unaffected upper hand before and after a treatment regimen of 49 days that contrasted morphine and an NMDA-receptor antagonist with morphine and placebo. We postulated superior pain relief for the combination therapy and concomitant changes in brain areas associated with nociceptive processing. Only the combination therapy reduced pain at rest and during movement, and disability. After treatment, activation in the contralateral primary somatosensory (cS1) and anterior cingulate cortex was significantly reduced when the affected hand was moved. Pain relief during therapy was related to decreased activation in cS1 and secondary somatosensory cortex (S2). Our data suggest that the combination of morphine with an NMDA-receptor antagonist significantly affects the cerebral processing of nociceptive information in CRPS. The correlation of pain relief and decrease in cortical activity in cS1 and S2 is in accordance with the expected impact of the NMDA-receptor antagonist on cerebral pain processing with emphasis on sensory-discriminative aspects of pain.

This trend is evident in and applicable to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment research given the high nonresponse rate of individuals with PTSD who undergo cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Functional connectivity analyses investigating disrupted brain networks across mental disorders have been employed to understand both mental disorder symptoms and therapeutic mechanisms. However, few studies have examined pre-post CBT brain changes in PTSD using functional connectivity analyses. The current study investigated a) whether brain networks commonly implicated in psychopathology (e.g., default mode network [DMN], central executive network [CEN], and salience network [SN]) changed following Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) for PTSD and b) whether change in these networks was associated with PTSD and/or transdiagnostic symptom change. Independent components analysis was implemented to investigate resting-state functional connectivity in DMN, CEN, and SN in 42 women with PTSD and 18 trauma-exposed controls (TEC). Results indicated decreased CEN-cerebellum connectivity in PTSD participants versus TEC prior to CPT and decreased DMN connectivity in PTSD participants after CPT. Additionally, DMN and SN connectivity was related to change in positive and negative affectivity, while exploratory analyses at a cluster threshold of pFDR < .10 indicated DMN and SN connectivity was also related to change in PTSD symptoms and rumination. These findings provide evidence for normalization of CEN connectivity with treatment and implicate the DMN and SN in clinical symptom change following CPT. ",
pmid_19170662,Altered impulse control in alcohol dependence: neural measures of stop signal performance.,,"Altered impulse control has been implicated in the shaping of habitual alcohol use and eventual alcohol dependence. We sought to identify the neural correlates of altered impulse control in 24 abstinent patients with alcohol dependence (PAD), as compared to 24 demographics matched healthy control subjects (HC). In particular, we examined the processes of risk taking and cognitive control as the neural endophenotypes of alcohol dependence. To this end, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was conducted during a stop signal task (SST), in which a procedure was used to elicit errors in the participants. The paradigm allowed trial-by-trial evaluation of response inhibition, error processing, and post-error behavioral adjustment. Furthermore, by imposing on the subjects to be both fast and accurate, the SST also introduced a distinct element of risk, which participants may or may not avert during the task. Brain imaging data were analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping in covariance analyses accounting for group disparity in general performance. The results showed that, compared to HC, PAD demonstrated longer go trial reaction time (RT) and higher stop success rate (SS%). HC and PAD were indistinguishable in stop signal reaction time (SSRT) and post-error slowing (PES). In a covariance analysis accounting for go trial RT and SS%, HC showed greater activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex than PAD, when subjects with short and long SSRT were contrasted. By comparing PAD and HC directly during stop errors (SE), as contrasted with SS, we observed greater activity in PAD in bilateral visual and frontal cortices. Compared to HC, PAD showed less activation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during PES, an index of post-error behavioral adjustment. Furthermore, PAD who showed higher alcohol urge at the time of the fMRI were particularly impaired in dorsolateral prefrontal activation, as compared to those with lower alcohol urge. Finally, compared to HC subjects, PAD showed less activity in cortical and subcortical structures including putamen, insula, and amygdala during risk-taking decisions in the SST. These preliminary results provided evidence for altered neural processing during impulse control in PAD. These findings may provide a useful neural signature in the evaluation of treatment outcomes and development of novel pharmacotherapy for alcohol dependence. ",
pmid_18620789,Brain activation and deactivation during location and color working memory tasks in 11-13-year-old children.,,"Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and n-back tasks we investigated whether, in 11-13-year-old children, spatial (location) and nonspatial (color) information is differentially processed during visual attention (0-back) and working memory (WM) (2-back) tasks and whether such cognitive task performance, compared to a resting state, results in regional deactivation. The location 0-back task, compared to the color 0-back task, activated segregated areas in the frontal, parietal and occipital cortices whereas no differentially activated voxels were obtained when location and color 2-back tasks were directly contrasted. Several midline cortical areas were less active during 0- and 2-back task performance than resting state. The task-induced deactivation increased with task difficulty as demonstrated by larger deactivation during 2-back than 0-back tasks. The results suggest that, in 11-13-year-old children, the visual attentional network is differently recruited by spatial and nonspatial information processing, but the functional organization of cortical activation in WM in this age group is not based on the type of information processed. Furthermore, 11-13-year-old children exhibited a similar pattern of cortical deactivation that has been reported in adults during cognitive task performance compared to a resting state. ",
pmid_32413079,Direct comparison of activation maps during galvanic vestibular stimulation: A hybrid H2[15 O] PET-BOLD MRI activation study.,,"Previous unimodal PET and fMRI studies in humans revealed a reproducible vestibular brain activation pattern, but with variations in its weighting and expansiveness. Hybrid studies minimizing methodological variations at baseline conditions are rare and still lacking for task-based designs. Thus, we applied for the first time hybrid 3T PET-MRI scanning (Siemens mMR) in healthy volunteers using galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) in healthy volunteers in order to directly compare H215O-PET and BOLD MRI responses. List mode PET acquisition started with the injection of 750 MBq H215O simultaneously to MRI EPI sequences. Group-level statistical parametric maps were generated for GVS vs. rest contrasts of PET, MR-onset (event-related), and MR-block. All contrasts showed a similar bilateral vestibular activation pattern with remarkable proximity of activation foci. Both BOLD contrasts gave more bilateral wide-spread activation clusters than PET; no area showed contradictory signal responses. PET still confirmed the right-hemispheric lateralization of the vestibular system, whereas BOLD-onset revealed only a tendency. The reciprocal inhibitory visual-vestibular interaction concept was confirmed by PET signal decreases in primary and secondary visual cortices, and BOLD-block decreases in secondary visual areas. In conclusion, MRI activation maps contained a mixture of CBF measured using H215O-PET and additional non-CBF effects, and the activation-deactivation pattern of the BOLD-block appears to be more similar to the H215O-PET than the BOLD-onset.

Individual variation in neural structure has also been associated with impulsivity, a dimensional construct implicated in addictions. This study combines categorical (diagnosis-based) and dimensional (transdiagnostic) approaches to identify neural structural alterations linked to addiction subtypes and trait impulsivity, respectively, across individuals with gambling disorder (n = 35), individuals with cocaine-use disorder (n = 37) and healthy comparison individuals (n = 37). High-resolution T1-weighted data were analyzed using modulated voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Statistical analyses were conducted using whole-brain general-linear models, corrected for family-wise error (pFWE < .05). Categorical analyses indicated a main effect of diagnostic group on prefrontal (dorsal anterior cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortex) gray matter volumes (GMVs), involving decreased GMVs among cocaine-use disorder participants only. Dimensional analyses indicated a negative association between trait impulsivity and cortical (insula) and subcortical (amygdala and hippocampus) GMVs across all participants. Conjunction analysis indicated little anatomical overlap between regions identified as differentiating diagnostic groups and regions covarying with impulsivity. These data provide first evidence of neural structural differences between gambling disorder and an illicit substance-use disorder. They further indicate dissociable effects of diagnostic groupings and trait impulsivity on neural structure among individuals with behavioral and drug addictions. Study findings highlight the importance of considering both categorical and dimensional (e.g. Research Domain Criteria; RDoC) analysis approaches within the context of addictions research. ",
pmid_22944369,Amygdala responses to masked and low spatial frequency fearful faces: a preliminary fMRI study in panic disorder.,,"Previous studies have demonstrated amygdala activation in response to fearful faces even if presented below the threshold of conscious visual perception. It has also been proposed that subcortical regions are selectively sensitive to low spatial frequency (LSF) information. However, chronic hyperarousal may reduce amygdala activation in panic disorder (PD). Our aim was to establish whether the amygdala is engaged by masked and LSF fearful faces in PD as compared to healthy subjects. Neutral faces were used as the mask stimulus. Thirteen PD patients (seven females, six males; mean age=29.1 (S.D: 5.9)) and 15 healthy volunteers (seven females, eight males; mean age=27.9 (S.D. 4.5)) underwent two passive viewing tasks during a 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as follows: 1) presentation of faces with fearful versus neutral expressions (17ms) using a backward masking procedure and 2) presentation of the same faces whose spatial frequency contents had been manipulated by low-pass filtering. Level of awareness was confirmed by a forced choice fear-detection task. Whereas controls showed bilateral activation to fearful masked faces versus neutral faces, patients failed to show activation within the amygdala. LSF stimuli did not elicit amygdala response in either group, contrary to the view that LSF information plays a crucial role in the processing of facial expressions in the amygdala. Findings suggest maladaptive amygdala responses to potentially threatening visual stimuli in PD patients. ",

However, findings are poorly replicated, and it remains elusive whether distinct diagnoses of addiction are underpinned by shared abnormalities. Our aim was to conduct a quantitative meta-analysis of structural neuroimaging studies investigating GM abnormalities in two main categories of addiction: substance use disorders (SUD) and behavioral addictions (BA). A systematic database search was conducted in several databases from Jan 1, 2010, to Oct 23, 2020, to identify eligible VBM studies. Meta-analysis was performed with the seed-based d mapping software package to compare alternations between individuals with addiction-related disorders and healthy controls (HC). A total of 59 VBM studies including 2096 individuals with addiction-related disorders and 2637 HC met the inclusion criteria. Individuals with addiction-related disorders showed shared GM volume decrease in bilateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral insula, bilateral rolandic operculum, left superior temporal gyrus, and right Heschl gyrus and GM increase in right lingual gyrus and right fusiform gyrus comparing with HC (p < 0.005). Subgroup analysis found heterogeneity between SUD and BA mainly in left inferior occipital gyrus and right striatum (p < 0.005). Meta-regression revealed that GM atrophy in right anterior cingulate (r = 0.541, p = 0.03 (uncorrected)) and left inferior frontal gyrus (r = 0.595, p = 0.015) were positively correlated with higher impulsivity. This meta-analysis identified a concordance across subtypes of addiction in terms of the brain structural changes in prefrontal and insula areas, which may relate to higher impulsivity observed across addiction diagnoses. This concordance provides an organizing model that emphasizes the importance of shared neural substrates in addiction. ",

We therefore examined gray matter (GM) morphology in individuals with ALC, focusing on differences in prefrontal regions that have been associated with self-control. Additionally, we accounted for differences in lifetime alcohol intake regarding self-control measures and cortical structures in ALC patients. With voxel-based morphometry (VBM) focusing on prefrontal a priori defined regions of interest, we assessed a group of 62 detoxified ALC patients and 62 healthy controls (HC). ALC patients were subsequently divided into high (n = 9) and low consumers (n = 53). Self-control was assessed by use of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale and the Sensation Seeking Scale. Compared to HC, ALC had significantly less GM volume in bilateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and right medial prefrontal cortex as well as in the right anterior cingulate. High-consuming ALC showed smaller GM in right orbitofrontal cortex as well as lower sensation seeking scores than low consumers. In low-consuming ALC, right MFG-GM was positively associated with magnitude of sensation seeking; particularly, larger MFG-GM correlated with greater thrill and adventure seeking. Thus, our findings (i) indicate deficient GM volume in prefrontal areas related to self-control and (ii) might accentuate the phenotypic divergence of ALC patients and emphasize the importance of the development of individual treatment options.

pmid_21924367,Reliability analysis of the resting state can sensitively and specifically identify the presence of Parkinson disease.,,"Parkinson disease (PD) is characterized by a number of motor and behavioral abnormalities that could be considered deficits of a ""no task"" or ""resting"" state, including resting motor findings and defects in emerging from a resting state (e.g., resting tremor, elevated resting tone, abulia, akinesia, apathy). PET imaging, and recently, the MRI technique of continuous arterial spin labeling (CASL) have shown evidence of changes in metabolic patterns in individuals with PD. The purpose of this study was to learn if the presence of PD could be ""predicted"" based on resting fluctuations of the BOLD signal. Participants were 15 healthy controls, 14 subjects with PD, and 1 subject who presented as a control but later developed PD. The amplitude of the low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) was used as an index of brain activity level in the resting state. Participants with PD using this index showed a reliable decrease in activity in a number of regions, including the supplementary motor cortex, the mesial prefrontal cortex, the right middle frontal gyrus, and the left cerebellum (lobule VII/VIII) as well as increased activity in the right cerebellum (lobule IV/V). Using a cross validation approach we term ""Reliability Mapping of Regional Differences"" (RMRD) to analyze our sample, we were able to reliably distinguish participants with PD from controls with 92% sensitivity and 87% specificity. Our ""pre-diagnostic"" subject segregated in our analysis with the PD group. These results suggest that resting fMRI should be considered for development as a biomarker and analytical tool for evaluation of PD. ",

Mindfulness
fMRI","Mindfulness practice is beneficial for emotion regulation; however, the neural mechanisms underlying this effect are poorly understood. The current study focuses on effects of attention-to-breath (ATB) as a basic mindfulness practice on aversive emotions at behavioral and brain levels. A key finding across different emotion regulation strategies is the modulation of amygdala and prefrontal activity. It is unclear how ATB relevant brain areas in the prefrontal cortex integrate with amygdala activation during emotional stimulation. We proposed that, during emotional stimulation, ATB down-regulates activation in the amygdala and increases its integration with prefrontal regions. To address this hypothesis, 26 healthy controls were trained in mindfulness-based attention-to-breath meditation for two weeks and then stimulated with aversive pictures during both attention-to-breath and passive viewing while undergoing fMRI. Data were controlled for breathing frequency. Results indicate that (1) ATB was effective in regulating aversive emotions. (2) Left dorso-medial prefrontal cortex was associated with ATB in general. (3) A fronto-parietal network was additionally recruited during emotional stimulation. (4) ATB down regulated amygdala activation and increased amygdala-prefrontal integration, with such increased integration being associated with mindfulness ability. Results suggest amygdala-dorsal prefrontal cortex integration as a potential neural pathway of emotion regulation by mindfulness practice. ",

validity","Although social cognition is frequently identified as a target in clinical trials and psychosocial interventions for adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), these efforts are hampered by a lack of consensus and validation of social cognitive measures. The current study provides psychometric evaluation of 11 frequently used measures encompassing different subdomains of social cognition. Adults with autism (N = 103) and typically developing controls (N = 95) completed 11 commonly used social cognitive tasks spanning the domains of emotion processing, social perception, and mentalizing/theory of mind. We examined each measure's internal reliability and sensitivity to group differences, how performance related to general intellectual ability, and alignment of measures with a proposed two-factor structure of social cognition in ASD. Controls outperformed the ASD group on 8 of the 11 social cognitive tasks, with the largest group differences occurring on two mentalizing measures, The awareness of social inference task (TASIT) and hinting task. In ASD, all tasks demonstrated strong internal consistency and avoided ceiling and floor effects. Social cognitive performance was also related to, but not redundant with, intellectual functioning. We also found support for a two-factor structure of social cognition, with basic social perception and emotional processing aligning into a lower-order social perception factor, while mentalizing tasks aligned into a higher-order social appraisal factor. In sum, eight tasks showed adequate to strong psychometric properties. The psychometric data, effect size estimates, and correlations between measures reported here can be used for study planning for social cognitive interventions in autism. Autism Research 2019, 12: 766-778. © 2019 The Authors. Autism Research published by International Society for Autism Research published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: We examined 11 tasks that measure how adults with autism perceive and interpret social information. Eight of the tasks were reliable and showed lower performance in adults with autism compared to typically-developing controls. Task performance was related to but distinguishable from IQ. These measures evaluated here may be useful in assessing the effectiveness of interventions and treatments to improve social abilities in adults with autism. ",
pmid_18631977,Abnormal connectivity in the posterior cingulate and hippocampus in early Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.,,"Brain imaging studies of early Alzheimer's disease (AD) have shown decreased metabolism predominantly in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), medial temporal lobe, and inferior parietal lobe. This study investigated functional connectivity between these regions, as well as connectivity between these regions and the whole brain. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies were performed in subjects with early AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal controls. The data indicate both decreased fiber connections and disrupted connectivity between the hippocampus and PCC in early AD. The MCI group showed reduced fiber numbers derived from PCC and hippocampus to the whole brain. The fMRI and DTI results confirmed decreased connectivity from both the PCC and hippocampus to the whole brain in MCI and AD and reduction in connectivity between these two regions, which plausibly represents an early imaging biomarker for AD.

fMRI","Exposure-based psychotherapy is a first-line treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but its mechanisms are poorly understood. Functional brain connectivity is a promising metric for identifying treatment mechanisms and biosignatures of therapeutic response. To this end, we assessed amygdala and insula treatment-related connectivity changes and their relationship to PTSD symptom improvements. Individuals with a primary PTSD diagnosis (N = 66) participated in a randomized clinical trial of prolonged exposure therapy (n = 36) versus treatment waiting list (n = 30). Task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging was completed prior to randomization and 1 month following cessation of treatment/waiting list. Whole-brain blood oxygenation level-dependent responses were acquired. Intrinsic connectivity was assessed by subregion in the amygdala and insula, limbic structures key to the disorder pathophysiology. Dynamic causal modeling assessed evidence for effective connectivity changes in select nodes informed by intrinsic connectivity findings. The amygdala and insula displayed widespread patterns of primarily subregion-uniform intrinsic connectivity change, including increased connectivity between the amygdala and insula; increased connectivity of both regions with the ventral prefrontal cortex and frontopolar and sensory cortices; and decreased connectivity of both regions with the left frontoparietal nodes of the executive control network. Larger decreases in amygdala-frontal connectivity and insula-parietal connectivity were associated with larger PTSD symptom reductions. Dynamic causal modeling evidence suggested that treatment decreased left frontal inhibition of the left amygdala, and larger decreases were associated with larger symptom reductions. PTSD psychotherapy adaptively attenuates functional interactions between frontoparietal and limbic brain circuitry at rest, which may reflect a potential mechanism or biosignature of recovery. ",
pmid_21055874,A non-elaborative mental stance and decoupling of executive and pain-related cortices predicts low pain sensitivity in Zen meditators.,,"Concepts originating from ancient Eastern texts are now being explored scientifically, leading to new insights into mind/brain function. Meditative practice, often viewed as an emotion regulation strategy, has been associated with pain reduction, low pain sensitivity, chronic pain improvement, and thickness of pain-related cortices. Zen meditation is unlike previously studied emotion regulation techniques; more akin to 'no appraisal' than 'reappraisal'. This implies the cognitive evaluation of pain may be involved in the pain-related effects observed in meditators. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a thermal pain paradigm we show that practitioners of Zen, compared to controls, reduce activity in executive, evaluative and emotion areas during pain (prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus). Meditators with the most experience showed the largest activation reductions. Simultaneously, meditators more robustly activated primary pain processing regions (anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, insula). Importantly, the lower pain sensitivity in meditators was strongly predicted by reductions in functional connectivity between executive and pain-related cortices. Results suggest a functional decoupling of the cognitive-evaluative and sensory-discriminative dimensions of pain, possibly allowing practitioners to view painful stimuli more neutrally. The activation pattern is remarkably consistent with the mindset described in Zen and the notion of mindfulness. Our findings contrast and challenge current concepts of pain and emotion regulation and cognitive control; commonly thought to manifest through increased activation of frontal executive areas. We suggest it is possible to self-regulate in a more 'passive' manner, by reducing higher-order evaluative processes, as demonstrated here by the disengagement of anterior brain systems in meditators.

pmid_22310505,Altered neural reward representations in pathological gamblers revealed by delay and probability discounting.,,"The neural basis of excessive delay discounting and reduced risk sensitivity of pathological gamblers with a particular focus on subjective neural reward representations has not been previously examined. To examine how pathological gamblers represent subjective reward value at a neural level and how this is affected by gambling severity. Model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging study with patients and control subjects. Department of Systems Neuroscience, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. Participants were recruited from the local community by advertisement and through self-help groups. A sample of 16 pathological gamblers (according to the DSM-IV definition) was matched by age, sex, smoking status, income, educational level, and handedness to 16 healthy controls. Pathological gamblers showed increased discounting of delayed rewards and a trend toward decreased discounting of probabilistic rewards compared with matched controls. At the neural level, a significant group × condition interaction indicated that reward representations in the gamblers were modulated in a condition-specific manner, such that they exhibited increased (delay discounting) and decreased (probability discounting) neural value correlations in the reward system. In addition, throughout the reward system, neuronal value signals for delayed rewards were negatively correlated with gambling severity. The results extend previous reports of a generally hypoactive reward system in pathological gamblers by showing that, even when subjective reward valuation is accounted for, gamblers still show altered reward representations. Furthermore, results point toward a gradual degradation of mesolimbic reward representations for delayed rewards during the course of pathological gambling. ",
pmid_24213861,PET studies of encoding and retrieval: The HERA model.,,"We review positron emission tomography (PET) studies whose results converge on the hemispheric encoding/retrieval asymmetry (HERA) model of the involvement of prefrontal cortical regions in the processes of human memory. The model holds that the left prefrontal cortex is differentially more involved in retrieval of information from semantic memory, and in simultaneously encoding novel aspects of the retrieved information into episodic memory, than is the right prefrontal cortex. The right prefrontal cortex, on the other hand, is differentially more involved in episodic memory retrieval than is the left prefrontal cortex. This general pattern holds for different kinds of information (e.g., verbal materials, pictures, faces) and a variety of conditions of encoding and retrieval. ",

fMRI","The two most commonly used illegal substances by adolescents in the United States are alcohol and cannabis. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and cannabis use disorder (CUD) have been associated with dysfunction in decision-making processes in adolescents. One potential mechanism for these impairments is thought to be related to abnormalities in reward and punishment processing. However, very little work has directly examined potential differential relationships between AUD and CUD symptom severity and neural dysfunction during decision making in adolescents. In the current study, 154 youths participated in a passive avoidance learning task during functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the relationship between relative severity of AUD/CUD and dysfunction in processing reward and punishment feedback. Increasing Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test scores were associated with reduced neural differentiation between reward and punishment feedback within regions of striatum, posterior cingulate cortex, and parietal cortex. However, increasing Cannabis Use Disorder Identification Test scores were not associated with any neural dysfunction during the passive avoidance task. These data expand on emerging literature that relative severity of AUD is associated with reduced responsivity to rewards in adolescents and that there are differential associations between AUD and CUD symptoms and neurocircuitry dysfunction in the developing adolescent brain.

obesity","GLP-1 analogs have recently risen to the forefront as effective medications for lowering weight through actions in the central nervous system (CNS). However, their actions in the CNS have not yet been studied in the human brain after longer-term administration at the highest dose approved for obesity (liraglutide 3.0 mg). A total of 20 participants with obesity were treated with placebo and liraglutide (3.0 mg) in the context of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trial after 5 weeks of dose escalation. Neurocognitive and neuroimaging (fMRI) responses to food cues were examined at the clinical research center of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. While using liraglutide, patients lost more weight (placebo-subtracted -2.7%; P < .001), had decreased fasting glucose (P < .001) and showed improved cholesterol levels. In an uncontrolled analysis, brain activation in response to food images was not altered by liraglutide vs placebo. When controlled for BMI/weight, liraglutide increased activation of the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in response to food cues (P < .016, corrected for multiple comparisons). In contrast to prior studies, we demonstrate for the first time that liraglutide treatment, administered over a longer period at the highest doses approved for obesity, does not alter brain activation in response to food cues. A counter-regulatory increase in reward-related OFC activation in response to food cues can be observed when neuroimaging data are controlled for BMI changes, indicating changes in CNS that could lead to later plateaus of weight loss. These data point to a promising focus for additional interventions which, by contributing to the CNS reward system, could provide tangible benefits in reversing the plateauing phenomenon and promoting further weight loss.

pmid_20836159,Functional neuroimaging at different disease stages reveals distinct phases of neuroplastic changes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,,"Some previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have revealed increased activation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients but longitudinal data on such activation changes are lacking. To assess the time course of changes in fMRI patterns and their potential contribution to the understanding of ALS pathophysiology, we, therefore, investigated a total of 22 patients with ALS and matched control participants while they performed a blocked motor task. Patients were assigned to three groups according to whether they had no (MRC grade 5), mild (MRC 4), or marked (MRC 3) weakness of the examined right hand. Significant activations were seen in primary motor and premotor cortex, somatosensory cortex, supplementary motor area and subcortical areas in all groups. The size of the activated area in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex was increased to a similar degree in all three ALS groups compared to control participants irrespective of weakness on clinical examination. Whereas movement related signal change and beta weights extracted from the activated cluster were unchanged relative to controls in ALS patients with no weakness, a marked decrease of these parameters was seen in patients with weakness. Two distinct stages of neuroplastic changes could be identified in ALS (first: increase of the activated area in contralateral sensorimotor cortex; second: reduction of signal change and beta weights with increasing weakness). We interpret the increase of the activated area as a result of decreased intracortical inhibition and the reduction of movement related signal change and beta weights as a consequence of loss of upper motor neurons.

pmid_24695275,A crucial role for white matter alterations in interference control problems of very preterm children.,,"Attention problems are among the most prominent behavioral deficits reported in very preterm children (below 32 wk of gestation) at school age. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the brain abnormalities underlying attention problems in very preterm children by investigating the role of abnormalities in white and gray brain matter during interference control, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-guided probabilistic diffusion tensor tractography. Twenty-nine very preterm children (mean (SD) age: 8.6 (0.3) y), and 47 term controls (mean (SD) age: 8.7 (0.5) y), performed a fMRI version of the Eriksen Flanker task measuring interference control. Very preterm children showed slower reaction times than term controls when interfering stimuli were presented, indicating poorer interference control. Very preterm children and term controls did not differ in mean activation of the cortical regions involved in interference control. However, impaired fractional anisotropy (FA) was found in very preterm children in specifically those fiber tracts that innervate the cortical regions involved in interference control. Lower FA was related to poorer interference control in very preterm children. White matter alterations have a crucial role in the interference control problems of very preterm children at school age.

pmid_25080518,Prefrontal involvement related to cognitive impairment in progressive muscular atrophy.,,"To examine brain activation patterns during verbal fluency performance in patients with progressive muscular atrophy (PMA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). fMRI was used to examine the blood oxygen level-dependent response during letter and category fluency performance in 18 patients with PMA, 21 patients with ALS, and 17 healthy control subjects, matched for age and education. fMRI results are reported at p<0.05, family-wise error (FWE)-corrected for multiple comparisons. We analyzed effects of performance, age-related white matter changes (ARWMC), and regional brain volumes; all participants underwent neuropsychological investigation. Disease duration of patients with PMA (mean 26.0 months, SD 13.6) and ALS (22.2 months, SD 11.4) was comparable. Patients with PMA and ALS had mild to moderate disease severity and showed impaired letter fluency compared with controls. Between-group analysis showed a main effect of group in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, Brodmann area 45) during letter fluency, which was unaffected by performance, ARWMC, and IFG volume: patients with PMA showed lower activation than controls but higher than that of patients with ALS (ALS<PMA<healthy controls; pFWE=0.035; z score 4.11; cluster size=11). A more caudal region in the IFG showed lower activation in patients with PMA than controls during letter fluency performance (post hoc test; pFWE=0.026). No activation differences were observed during the category fluency task. Prefrontal activation abnormalities are related to an important clinical measure of executive dysfunction in patients with motor neuron disease with and without upper motor neuron signs. ",

expected value","Youth with disruptive behavior disorders (DBD), including conduct disorder (CD) and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), have difficulties in reinforcement-based decision making, the neural basis of which is poorly understood. Studies examining decision making in youth with DBD have revealed reduced reward responses within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex/orbitofrontal cortex (vmPFC/OFC), increased responses to unexpected punishment within the vmPFC and striatum, and reduced use of expected value information in the anterior insula cortex and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex during the avoidance of suboptimal choices. Previous work has used only monetary reinforcement. The current study examined whether dysfunction in youth with DBD during decision making extended to environmental reinforcers. A total of 30 youth (15 healthy youth and 15 youth with DBD) completed a novel reinforcement-learning paradigm using environmental reinforcers (physical threat images, e.g., striking snake image; contamination threat images, e.g., rotting food; appetitive images, e.g., puppies) while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Behaviorally, healthy youth were significantly more likely to avoid physical threat, but not contamination threat, stimuli than youth with DBD. Imaging results revealed that youth with DBD showed significantly reduced use of expected value information in the bilateral caudate, thalamus, and posterior cingulate cortex during the avoidance of suboptimal responses. The current data suggest that youth with DBD show deficits to environmental reinforcers similar to the deficits seen to monetary reinforcers. Importantly, this deficit was unrelated to callous-unemotional (CU) traits, suggesting that caudate impairment may be a common deficit across youth with DBD. ",
pmid_25180885,Functional reorganization of the default mode network across chronic pain conditions.,,"Chronic pain is associated with neuronal plasticity. Here we use resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate functional changes in patients suffering from chronic back pain (CBP), complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and knee osteoarthritis (OA). We isolated five meaningful resting-state networks across the groups, of which only the default mode network (DMN) exhibited deviations from healthy controls. All patient groups showed decreased connectivity of medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) to the posterior constituents of the DMN, and increased connectivity to the insular cortex in proportion to the intensity of pain. Multiple DMN regions, especially the MPFC, exhibited increased high frequency oscillations, conjoined with decreased phase locking with parietal regions involved in processing attention. Both phase and frequency changes correlated to pain duration in OA and CBP patients. Thus chronic pain seems to reorganize the dynamics of the DMN and as such reflect the maladaptive physiology of different types of chronic pain. ",
pmid_17553706,A structural neural deficit in adolescents with conduct disorder and its association with lack of empathy.,,"The goal of this study was to determine whether brain regions implicated in emotion processing show structural alterations in adolescents with conduct disorder (CD). Using an optimized voxel-based morphometry protocol, we compared grey matter volume in 12 patients with CD and 12 age-, sex-, and intelligence-matched control subjects. Grey matter volume in bilateral anterior insular cortex and the left amygdala was significantly reduced in CD patients compared to healthy control subjects. The insular grey matter abnormalities could be attributed to aggressive behaviour. Moreover, bilateral anterior insular grey matter volume in CD patients correlated significantly with empathy scores. These novel findings point at a joint neuroanatomical substrate underpinning aggressive behaviour and impaired capacity of empathy and suggest a critical role for the anterior insula in regulating social behaviour. ",
pmid_19913621,Dissociation of neural networks for anticipation and consumption of monetary and social rewards.,,"Human behaviour is generally guided by the anticipation of potential outcomes that are considered to be rewarding. Reward processing can thus be dissected into a phase of reward anticipation and a phase of reward consumption. A number of brain structures have been suggested to be involved in reward processing. However, it is unclear whether anticipation and consumption are mediated by the same or different neural networks. We examined the neural basis of these processes using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in an incentive delay task offering either money or social approval. In both conditions participants (N=28) were given a cue indicating potential reward. In order to receive reward a target button had to be pushed within a certain time window (adapted for individual reaction time). Cues triggering either monetary or social reward anticipation were presented sessionwise. Imaging was performed on a 1.5-Tesla Philips scanner in an event-related design. Anticipation of both reward types activated brain structures constituting the brain reward system including the ventral striatum. In contrast to the task independent activity in the anticipation phase, reward consumption evoked different patterns of activation for money and social approval, respectively. While social stimuli were mainly associated with amygdala activation, the thalamus was more strongly activated by the presentation of monetary rewards. Our results identify dissociable neural networks for the anticipation and consumption of reward. The findings implicate that the neural mechanisms underlying reward consumption are more modality-specific than those for reward anticipation, and that they are mediated by subjective reward value.

This study aimed to determine the mechanism through which facial expressions influence cognitive control in young adults diagnosed with ADHD in childhood. Fourteen probands with childhood ADHD and 14 comparison subjects with no history of ADHD were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a face emotion go/no-go task. Event-related analyses contrasted activation and functional connectivity for cognitive control collapsed over face valence and tested for variations in activation for response execution and inhibition as a function of face valence. Probands with childhood ADHD made fewer correct responses and inhibitions overall than comparison subjects, but demonstrated comparable effects of face emotion on response execution and inhibition. The two groups showed similar frontotemporal activation for cognitive control collapsed across face valence, but differed in the functional connectivity of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, with fewer interactions with the subgenual cingulate cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, and putamen in probands than in comparison subjects. Further, valence-dependent activation for response execution was seen in the amygdala, ventral striatum, subgenual cingulate cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex in comparison subjects but not in probands. The findings point to functional anomalies in limbic networks for both the valence-dependent biasing of cognitive control and the valence-independent cognitive control of face emotion processing in probands with childhood ADHD. This limbic dysfunction could impact cognitive control in emotional contexts and may contribute to the social and emotional problems associated with ADHD. ",

Brain regions consisting of anterior cingulate, thalamus and occpito-temporal areas may increase the likelihood of becoming a pro-gamer or POGA. Twenty POGA, seventeen pro-gamers, and eighteen healthy comparison subjects (HC) were recruited. All magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on a 1.5 Tesla Espree MRI scanner (SIEMENS, Erlangen, Germany). Voxel-wise comparisons of gray matter volume were performed between the groups using the two-sample t-test with statistical parametric mapping (SPM5). Compared to HC, the POGA group showed increased impulsiveness and perseverative errors, and volume in left thalamus gray matter, but decreased gray matter volume in both inferior temporal gyri, right middle occipital gyrus, and left inferior occipital gyrus, compared with HC. Pro-gamers showed increased gray matter volume in left cingulate gyrus, but decreased gray matter volume in left middle occipital gyrus and right inferior temporal gyrus compared with HC. Additionally, the pro-gamer group showed increased gray matter volume in left cingulate gyrus and decreased left thalamus gray matter volume compared with the POGA group. The current study suggests that increased gray matter volumes of the left cingulate gyrus in pro-gamers and of the left thalamus in POGA may contribute to the different clinical characteristics of pro-gamers and POGA.

pmid_15183385,Cerebral activation related to skills practice in a double serial reaction time task: striatal involvement in random-order sequence learning.,,"We used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to examine the distribution of cerebral activation related to prolonged skill practice. In a bimanual variant of the Serial Reaction Time Task (SRT), simultaneous finger movements of the two hands were made in response to randomly ordered pairs of visual stimuli (Double SRT, DoSRT). Extended practice by a week of daily performance resulted in gradual decrease of reaction times, associated with an increased involvement of the ventral putamen and globus pallidus, reaching statistical significance only on the left side (Statistical Parametric Mapping, SPM99). This increase was complementary to a decrease of cortical activations. The striatal activation after training on random order stimuli indicates that the striatum is not exclusively involved in sequence learning. This extended function implies a role in the acquisition of basic visuomotor skills that includes the specific selection of the appropriate muscles in response to independent stimuli. ",

The perceptual effects of apparent rotation persist while the current is being applied, but there is a subjective decay over the entire stimulation period. Particularly during DC-GVS in a supine position, subjects report a strong vestibular sensation related to the onset and offset of the stimulus, and weaker effects during constant DC-GVS stimulation. In the present study, we analyzed DC-GVS fMRI data from a group of volunteers with two different statistical models. In model I, the effects of GVS were modeled as a single regressor that described the periods during which the current was switched on. In model II, an additional regressor describing the onset and offset of the stimulation was included. The activation pattern found by using model I included only a subset of the activation patterns known to respond to vestibular stimulation from previous imaging studies. Model II revealed two different activation maps: block effects similar to the results obtained in model I and additional transient GVS effects with larger activation clusters and higher t-values. This extended activation pattern resembled the results obtained during AC-GVS, including multisensory vestibular projection areas. We show that the major part of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses elicited by DC-GVS is related to the on- and offset of stimulation currents and reflects the perceptual experience just-described. In addition, the separate modeling of transient and persistent effects of DC-GVS can identify distinct cortical correlates of those effects. ",

Research on the impact of food advertising in adolescents is lacking and no prior research has investigated neural predictors of food intake in adolescents. Neural systems implicated in reward could be key to understanding how food advertising drives food intake. To investigate how neural responses to both unhealthy and healthier FF commercials predict food intake in adolescents. A cross-sectional sample of 171 adolescents (aged 13-16 y) who ranged from normal weight to obese completed an fMRI paradigm where they viewed unhealthy and healthier FF and nonfood commercials. Adolescents then consumed a meal in a simulated FF restaurant where foods of varying nutritional profiles (unhealthy compared with healthier) were available. Greater neural activation in reward-related regions (nucleus accumbens, r = 0.29; caudate nucleus, r = 0.27) to unhealthy FF commercials predicted greater total food intake. Greater responses to healthier FF relative to nonfood commercials in regions associated with reward (i.e., nucleus accumbens, r = 0.24), memory (i.e., hippocampus, r = 0.32), and sensorimotor processes (i.e., anterior cerebellum, r = 0.33) predicted greater total food and unhealthier food intake, but not healthier food intake. Lower activation in neural regions associated with visual attention and salience (e.g., precuneus, r = -0.35) to unhealthy relative to healthier FF commercials predicted healthier food intake. These findings suggest that FF commercials contribute to overeating in adolescents through reward mechanisms. The addition of healthier commercials from FF restaurants is unlikely to encourage healthier food intake, but interventions that reduce the ability of unhealthy FF commercials to capture attention could be beneficial. However, an overall reduction in the amount of FF commercials exposure for adolescents is likely to be the most effective approach. ",

Participants were 13 recent users (two to seven days abstinent), 13 abstinent users (27 to 60 days abstinent), and 18 nonusing controls, all ages 15 to 18. Groups were similar on demographics, had no psychiatric or medical disorders, and user groups were similar on substance histories. Teens performed a two-back SWM task during fMRI. Recent users showed greater fMRI response in medial and left superior prefrontal cortices, as well as bilateral insula. Abstinent users had increased response in the right precentral gyrus (clusters > or = 1328 microl, p < .05). Results suggest that adolescents who recently used marijuana show increased brain activity in regions associated with working memory updating and inhibition. This study preliminarily suggests that (1) recent marijuana use may disrupt neural connections associated with SWM and result in compensatory brain response, and (2) sustained abstinence from marijuana may be associated with improvements in SWM response among adolescents.

Resting-state functional MRI
Type 2 diabetes mellitus","Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with increased risk for dementia. Patients with impaired cognition often show default-mode network disruption. We aimed to investigate the integrity of a default-mode network in diabetic patients by using independent component analysis, and to explore the relationship between network abnormalities, neurocognitive performance and diabetic variables. Forty-two patients with type 2 diabetes and 42 well-matched healthy controls were included and underwent resting-state functional MRI in a 3 Tesla unit. Independent component analysis was adopted to extract the default-mode network, including its anterior and posterior components. Z-maps of both sub-networks were compared between the two groups and correlated with each clinical variable. Patients showed increased connectivity around the medial prefrontal cortex in the anterior sub-network, but decreased connectivity around the posterior cingulate cortex in the posterior sub-network. The decreased connectivity in the posterior part was significantly correlated with the score on Complex Figure Test-delay recall test (r = 0.359, p = 0.020), the time spent on Trail-Making Test-part B (r = -0.346, p = 0.025) and the insulin resistance level (r = -0.404, p = 0.024). Dissociation pattern in the default-mode network was found in diabetic patients, which might provide powerful new insights into the neural mechanisms that underlie the diabetes-related cognitive decline. • Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with impaired cognition • Default- mode network plays a central role in maintaining normal cognition • Network connectivity within the default mode was disrupted in type 2 diabetes patients • Decreased network connectivity was correlated with cognitive performance and insulin resistance level • Disrupted default-mode network might explain the impaired cognition in diabetic population.

pmid_18677746,Neural networks involved in artistic creativity.,,"Creativity has been proposed to be either the result of solely right hemisphere processes or of interhemispheric interactions. Little information is available, however, concerning the neuronal foundations of creativity. In this study, we introduced a new artistic task, designing a new tool (a pen), which let us quantitatively evaluate creativity by three indices of originality. These scores were analyzed in combination with brain activities measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The results were compared between subjects who had been formally trained in design (experts) and novice subjects. In the experts, creativity was quantitatively correlated with the degree of dominance of the right prefrontal cortex over that of the left, but not with that of the right or left prefrontal cortex alone. In contrast, in novice subjects, only a negative correlation with creativity was observed in the bilateral inferior parietal cortex. We introduced structure equation modeling to analyze the interactions among these four brain areas and originality indices. The results predicted that training exerts a direct effect on the left parietal cortex. Additionally, as a result of the indirect effects, the activity of the right prefrontal cortex was facilitated, and the left prefrontal and right parietal cortices were suppressed. Our results supported the hypothesis that training increases creativity via reorganized intercortical interactions. ",
pmid_25420125,Avatar's neurobiological traces in the self-concept of massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) addicts.,,"Psychometric studies suggest that observed self-concept deficits in addicted massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) are compensated through the replacement of their ideal (i.e., how an individual would like to be) by their own avatar (i.e., graphical agent in the virtual world). Neurobiological studies indicate that increased identification with their own avatar in regular MMORPG gamers is possibly reflected by enhanced avatar-referential brain activation in the left angular gyrus (AG). However, the neurobiological correlates reflecting the relations of the avatar to addicted gamers' self and ideal are still unexplored. Therefore, we compare these relations between addicted and nonaddicted MMORPG gamers. A sample of n = 15 addicted and n = 17 nonaddicted players underwent functional MRI (fMRI) while completing a Giessen-Test (GT)-derived paradigm assessing self-, ideal-, and avatar-related self-concept domains. Neurobiological analyses included the comparisons avatar versus self, avatar versus ideal, and avatar versus self, ideal. Psychometrically, addicts showed significantly lower scores on the self-concept subscale of 'social resonance,' that is, social popularity. In all avatar-related contrasts, within-group comparisons showed addicted players to exhibit significantly higher brain activations in the left AG. The between-groups comparisons revealed avatar-related left AG hyperactivations in addicts. Our results may suggest that addicted MMORPG players identify significantly more with their avatar than nonaddicted gamers. The concrete avatar might increasingly replace the rather abstract ideal in the transition from normal- controlled to addictive-compulsive MMORPG usage. ",
pmid_15627588,Load- and practice-dependent increases in cerebro-cerebellar activation in verbal working memory: an fMRI study.,,"Load-dependent and practice-related changes in neocortical and cerebellar structures involved in verbal working memory (VWM) were investigated using functional MRI (fMRI) and a two alternative forced choice Sternberg paradigm. Using working memory loads ranging from 2 to 6 letters, regions exhibiting linear and quadratic trends in load-dependent activations were identified. Behaviorally, reaction time measurements revealed significant linear increases with increasing memory load, and significant decreases with increased task practice. Brain activations indicated a preponderance of linear load-dependent responses in both superior (lobule VI/Crus I) and inferior (lobule VIIB/VIIIA) cerebellar hemispheres, as well as in areas of neocortex including left precentral (BA 6), inferior frontal (BA 47), parahippocampal (BA 35), inferior parietal (BA 40), cingulate (BA 32), and right inferior and middle frontal (BA 46/47) regions. Fewer voxels exhibited quadratic without linear trends with the most prominent of these activations located in left inferior parietal (BA 40), precuneus, and parahippocampal regions. Analysis of load x session interactions revealed that right inferior cerebellar and left inferior parietal activations increased with practice, as did the correlations between activation in each region with reaction time, suggesting that changes in this cerebro-cerebellar network underlie practice-related increases in efficiency of VWM performance. These results replicate and extend our previous findings of fMRI activation in the cerebellum during VWM, and demonstrate predominately linear increases in cerebro-cerebellar activation with increasing memory load as well as changes in network function with increased task proficiency.

pmid_20138482,Neurobiological correlates of problem gambling in a quasi-realistic blackjack scenario as revealed by fMRI.,,"In the present study we obtained functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in occasional gamblers (OG) and problem gamblers (PG) during a quasi-realistic blackjack game. We focused on neuronal correlates of risk assessment and reward processing. Participants had to decide whether to draw or not to draw a card in a high-risk or low-risk blackjack situation. We assumed PG would show differences in prefrontal and ventral striatal brain regions in comparison to OG during risk assessment and due to the winning or losing of money. Although both groups did not differ in behavioral data, blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals in PG and OG significantly differed in thalamic, inferior frontal, and superior temporal regions. Whereas PG demonstrated a consistent signal increase during high-risk situations and a decrease in low-risk situations, OG presented the opposite pattern. During reward processing as derived from contrasting winning vs. losing situations, both PG and OG groups showed an enhancement of ventral striatal and posterior cingulate activity. Furthermore, PG demonstrated a distinct fronto-parietal activation pattern which has been discussed to reflect a cue-induced addiction memory network which was triggered by gambling-related cues. ",
pmid_17679639,Functional and biochemical alterations of the medial frontal cortex in obsessive-compulsive disorder.,,"The medial frontal cortex (MFC), including the dorsal anterior cingulate and the supplementary motor area, is critical for adaptive and inhibitory control of behavior. Abnormally high MFC activity has been a consistent finding in functional neuroimaging studies of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, the precise regions and the neural alterations associated with this abnormality remain unclear. To examine the functional and biochemical properties of the MFC in patients with OCD. Cross-sectional study combining volume-localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and functional magnetic resonance imaging with a task encompassing inhibitory control processes (the Multi-Source Interference Task) designed to activate the MFC. Healthy control participants and OCD patients recruited from the general community. Nineteen OCD patients (10 males and 9 females) and 19 age-, sex-, education-, and intelligence-matched control participants recruited from the general community. Psychometric measures of symptom severity, Multi-Source Interference Task behavioral performance, blood oxygen level-dependent activation, and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy brain metabolite concentrations. Multi-Source Interference Task behavioral performance did not differ between OCD patients and control subjects. Reaction time interference and response errors were correlated with blood oxygen level-dependent activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate region in both groups. Compared with controls, OCD patients had greater relative activation of the supplementary motor area and deactivation of the rostral anterior cingulate during high- vs low-conflict (incongruent > congruent) trials. Patients with OCD also showed reduced levels of neuronal N-acetylaspartate in the dorsal anterior cingulate region, which was negatively correlated with their blood oxygen level-dependent activation of the region. Hyperactivation of the MFC during high- vs low-conflict conditions in patients with OCD may be a compensatory response to a neuronal abnormality in the region. This relationship may partly explain the nature of inhibitory control deficits that are frequently seen in this group and may serve as a focus of future treatment studies. ",
pmid_22819939,Impaired functional but preserved structural connectivity in limbic white matter tracts in youth with conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder plus psychopathic traits.,,"Youths with conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder and psychopathic traits (CD/ODD+PT) are at high risk of adult antisocial behavior and psychopathy. Neuroimaging studies demonstrate functional abnormalities in orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala in both youths and adults with psychopathic traits. Diffusion tensor imaging in psychopathic adults demonstrates disrupted structural connectivity between these regions (uncinate fasiculus). The current study examined whether functional neural abnormalities present in youths with CD/ODD+PT are associated with similar white matter abnormalities. Youths with CD/ODD+PT and comparison participants completed 3.0 T diffusion tensor scans and functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. Diffusion tensor imaging did not reveal disruption in structural connections within the uncinate fasiculus or other white matter tracts in youths with CD/ODD+PT, despite the demonstration of disrupted amygdala-prefrontal functional connectivity in these youths. These results suggest that disrupted amygdala-frontal white matter connectivity as measured by fractional anisotropy is less sensitive than imaging measurements of functional perturbations in youths with psychopathic traits. If white matter tracts are intact in youths with this disorder, childhood may provide a critical window for intervention and treatment, before significant structural brain abnormalities solidify. ",
pmid_19699719,Top-down and bottom-up modulation of brain structures involved in auditory discrimination.,,"Auditory deviancy detection comprises both automatic and voluntary processing. Here, we investigated the neural correlates of different components of the sensory discrimination process using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subliminal auditory processing of deviant events that were not detected led to activation in left superior temporal gyrus. On the other hand, both correct detection of deviancy and false alarms activated a frontoparietal network of attentional processing and response selection, i.e. this network was activated regardless of the physical presence of deviant events. Finally, activation in the putamen, anterior cingulate and middle temporal cortex depended on factual stimulus representations and occurred only during correct deviancy detection. These results indicate that sensory discrimination may rely on dynamic bottom-up and top-down interactions. ",

Neurovascular coupling
Type 2 diabetes mellites (T2DM)","Previous studies presumed that the disturbed neurovascular coupling to be a critical risk factor of cognitive impairments in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but distinct clinical manifestations were lacked. Consequently, we decided to investigate the neurovascular coupling in T2DM patients by exploring the MRI relationship between neuronal activity and the corresponding cerebral blood perfusion. Degree centrality (DC) map and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) map were used to represent neuronal activity. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) map was used to represent cerebral blood perfusion. Correlation coefficients were calculated to reflect the relationship between neuronal activity and cerebral blood perfusion. At the whole gray matter level, the manifestation of neurovascular coupling was investigated by using 4 neurovascular biomarkers. We compared these biomarkers and found no significant changes. However, at the brain region level, neurovascular biomarkers in T2DM patients were significantly decreased in 10 brain regions. ALFF-CBF in left hippocampus and fractional ALFF-CBF in left amygdala were positively associated with the executive function, while ALFF-CBF in right fusiform gyrus was negatively related to the executive function. The disease severity was negatively related to the memory and executive function. The longer duration of T2DM was related to the milder depression, which suggests T2DM-related depression may not be a physiological condition but be a psychological condition. Correlations between neuronal activity and cerebral perfusion maps may be a method for detecting neurovascular coupling abnormalities, which could be used for diagnosis in the future.

Whole-hand grasp","Although the neural underpinnings of visually guided grasping and reaching have been well delineated within lateral and medial fronto-parietal networks (respectively), the contributions of subcomponents of visuomotor actions have not been explored in detail. Using careful subtraction logic, here we investigated which aspects of grasping, reaching, and pointing movements drive activation across key areas within visuomotor networks implicated in hand actions. For grasping tasks, we find activation differences based on the precision required (fine > coarse grip: anterior intraparietal sulcus, aIPS), the requirement to lift the object (grip + lift > grip: aIPS; dorsal premotor cortex, PMd; and supplementary motor area, SMA), and the number of digits employed (3-/5- vs. 2-digit grasps: ventral premotor cortex, PMv; motor cortex, M1, and somatosensory cortex, S1). For reaching/pointing tasks, we find activation differences based on whether the task required arm transport ((reach-to-point with index finger and reach-to-touch with knuckles) vs. point-without-reach; anterior superior parietal lobule, aSPL) and whether it required pointing to the object centre ((point-without-reach and reach-to-point) vs. reach-to-touch: anterior superior parieto-occipital cortex, aSPOC). For point-without-reach, in which the index finger is oriented towards the object centre but from a distance (point-without-reach > (reach-to-point and reach-to-touch)), we find activation differences that may be related to the communicative nature of the task (temporo-parietal junction, TPJ) and the need to precisely locate the target (lateral occipito-temporal cortex, LOTC). The present findings elucidate the different subcomponents of hand actions and the roles of specific brain regions in their computation. ",

However, it is still unclear how feedback (outcomes of decision-making) affects the subsequent risky decision-making in individuals with IGD. In this study, twenty-four adolescents with IGD and 24 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing the balloon analog risk task (BART) to evaluate the effects of prior outcomes on brain activity during subsequent risky decision-making in adolescents with IGD. The covariance between risk level and activation of the bilateral ventral medial prefrontal cortex, left inferior frontal cortex, right ventral striatum (VS), left hippocampus/parahippocampus, right inferior occipital gyrus/fusiform gyrus and right inferior temporal gyrus demonstrated interaction effects of group by outcome ( ",

smoking","Mass media can powerfully affect health decision-making. Pre-testing through focus groups or surveys is a standard, though inconsistent, predictor of effectiveness. Converging evidence demonstrates that activity within brain systems associated with self-related processing can predict individual behavior in response to health messages. Preliminary evidence also suggests that neural activity in small groups can forecast population-level campaign outcomes. Less is known about the psychological processes that link neural activity and population-level outcomes, or how these predictions are affected by message content. We exposed 50 smokers to antismoking messages and used their aggregated neural activity within a 'self-localizer' defined region of medial prefrontal cortex to predict the success of the same campaign messages at the population level (n = 400,000 emails). Results demonstrate that: (i) independently localized neural activity during health message exposure complements existing self-report data in predicting population-level campaign responses (model combined R(2) up to 0.65) and (ii) this relationship depends on message content-self-related neural processing predicts outcomes in response to strong negative arguments against smoking and not in response to compositionally similar neutral images. These data advance understanding of the psychological link between brain and large-scale behavior and may aid the construction of more effective media health campaigns. ",
pmid_29252164,Always on guard: emotion regulation in women with borderline personality disorder compared to nonpatient controls and patients with cluster-C personality disorder.,,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by emotion dysregulation; however, it is unclear whether this is restricted to negative emotional stimuli or to what degree this is specific to BPD. We investigated neural correlates of hypothesized increased emotional sensitivity and impaired emotion regulation in patients with BPD. During functional MRI (fMRI) scanning, patients with BPD, nonpatient controls and patients with cluster-C personality disorder completed an emotion regulation task, including negative, positive and erotic social pictures. We included 55 patients with BPD, 42 nonpatient controls and 24 patients with cluster-C personality disorder in our analyses. Passive viewing of negative stimuli resulted in greater activity in the anterior insula, temporoparietal junction and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in patients with BPD than in nonpatient controls. The increased activity in the anterior insula and temporoparietal junction was also present when patients with BPD viewed positive stimuli. During regulation of negative stimuli compared with passive viewing, nonpatient controls showed greater activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, middle temporal gyrus and bilateral inferior parietal lobule. Patients with BPD did not show this increase in activity. Findings cannot be generalized to men, and patients represented a heterogeneous group regarding comorbid diagnoses and medication. When looking at emotional stimuli, patients with BPD showed a unique pattern of activity, suggesting an increase in brain activity involved in emotion generation. In the case of negative stimuli this is accompanied by increased activity in regulation areas. In contrast, increase of regulation processes seems absent when patients with BPD are explicitly instructed to regulate. Results of diagnosis specificity support a dimensional rather than a dichotomous differentiation between BPD and cluster-C personality disorder regarding emotional sensitivity and emotional regulation of social stimuli.

pmid_23555827,Altered default network resting-state functional connectivity in adolescents with Internet gaming addiction.,,"Excessive use of the Internet has been linked to a variety of negative psychosocial consequences. This study used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate whether functional connectivity is altered in adolescents with Internet gaming addiction (IGA). Seventeen adolescents with IGA and 24 normal control adolescents underwent a 7.3 minute resting-state fMRI scan. Posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) connectivity was determined in all subjects by investigating synchronized low-frequency fMRI signal fluctuations using a temporal correlation method. To assess the relationship between IGA symptom severity and PCC connectivity, contrast images representing areas correlated with PCC connectivity were correlated with the scores of the 17 subjects with IGA on the Chen Internet Addiction Scale (CIAS) and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11) and their hours of Internet use per week. There were no significant differences in the distributions of the age, gender, and years of education between the two groups. The subjects with IGA showed longer Internet use per week (hours) (p<0.0001) and higher CIAS (p<0.0001) and BIS-11 (p = 0.01) scores than the controls. Compared with the control group, subjects with IGA exhibited increased functional connectivity in the bilateral cerebellum posterior lobe and middle temporal gyrus. The bilateral inferior parietal lobule and right inferior temporal gyrus exhibited decreased connectivity. Connectivity with the PCC was positively correlated with CIAS scores in the right precuneus, posterior cingulate gyrus, thalamus, caudate, nucleus accumbens, supplementary motor area, and lingual gyrus. It was negatively correlated with the right cerebellum anterior lobe and left superior parietal lobule. Our results suggest that adolescents with IGA exhibit different resting-state patterns of brain activity. As these alterations are partially consistent with those in patients with substance addiction, they support the hypothesis that IGA as a behavioral addiction that may share similar neurobiological abnormalities with other addictive disorders.

pmid_21957237,Functional dissociation of hippocampal mechanism during implicit learning based on the domain of associations.,,"Traditionally, the medial temporal lobe (MTL) was linked to explicit or declarative memory in associative learning. However, recent studies have reported MTL involvement even when volunteers are not consciously aware of the learned contingencies. Therefore, the mechanism of the MTL-related learning process cannot be described sufficiently by the explicit/implicit distinction, and the underlying process in the MTL for associative learning needs a more functional characterization. A possible feature that would allow a functional specification also for implicit learning is the nature of the material that is learned. Given that implicit memory tasks often comprise a combination of perceptual and motor learning, we hypothesized that implicit learning of the perceptual but not the motor component entails MTL activation in these studies. To directly test this hypothesis, we designed a purely perceptual and a purely motor variant of the serial reaction time task. In two groups of human volunteers, behavioral results clearly showed that both variants were learned without awareness. Neuronal recordings using fMRI revealed that bilateral hippocampal activation was observed only for implicit learning of the perceptual sequence, not for the motor sequence. This dissociation clearly shows that the functional role of the hippocampus for learning is determined by the domain of the learned association and that the function of the medial temporal lobe system is the processing of contingencies between perceptual features regardless of the explicit or implicit nature of the ensuing memory.

pmid_14747300,Increased risk of type 2 diabetes in Alzheimer disease.,,"Alzheimer disease and type 2 diabetes are characterized by increased prevalence with aging, a genetic predisposition, and comparable pathological features in the islet and brain (amyloid derived from amyloid beta protein in the brain in Alzheimer disease and islet amyloid derived from islet amyloid polypeptide in the pancreas in type 2 diabetes). Evidence is growing to link precursors of amyloid deposition in the brain and pancreas with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease and type 2 diabetes, respectively. Given these similarities, we questioned whether there may be a common underlying mechanism predisposing to islet and cerebral amyloid. To address this, we first examined the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in a community-based controlled study, the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer Disease Patient Registry (ADPR), which follows patients with Alzheimer disease versus control subjects without Alzheimer disease. In addition to this clinical study, we performed a pathological study of autopsy cases from this same community to determine whether there is an increased prevalence of islet amyloid in patients with Alzheimer disease and increased prevalence of cerebral amyloid in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients who were enrolled in the ADPR (Alzheimer disease n = 100, non-Alzheimer disease control subjects n = 138) were classified according to fasting glucose concentration (FPG) as nondiabetic (FPG <110 mg/dl), impaired fasting glucose (IFG, FPG 110-125 mg/dl), and type 2 diabetes (FPG >126 mg/dl). The mean slope of FPG over 10 years in each case was also compared between Alzheimer disease and non-Alzheimer disease control subjects. Pancreas and brain were examined from autopsy specimens obtained from 105 humans (first, 28 cases of Alzheimer disease disease vs. 21 non-Alzheimer disease control subjects and, second, 35 subjects with type 2 diabetes vs. 21 non-type 2 diabetes control subjects) for the presence of islet and brain amyloid. Both type 2 diabetes (35% vs. 18%; P < 0.05) and IFG (46% vs. 24%; P < 0.01) were more prevalent in Alzheimer disease versus non-Alzheimer disease control subjects, so 81% of cases of Alzheimer disease had either type 2 diabetes or IFG. The slope of increase of FPG with age over 10 years was also greater in Alzheimer disease than non-Alzheimer disease control subjects (P < 0.01). Islet amyloid was more frequent (P < 0.05) and extensive (P < 0.05) in patients with Alzheimer disease than in non-Alzheimer disease control subjects. However, diffuse and neuritic plaques were not more common in type 2 diabetes than in control subjects. In cases of type 2 diabetes when they were present, the duration of type 2 diabetes correlated with the density of diffuse (P < 0.001) and neuritic plaques (P < 0.01). In this community cohort from southeast Minnesota, type 2 diabetes and IFG are more common in patients with Alzheimer disease than in control subjects, as is the pathological hallmark of type 2 diabetes, islet amyloid. However, there was no increase in brain plaque formation in cases of type 2 diabetes, although when it was present, it correlated in extent with duration of diabetes. These data support the hypothesis that patients with Alzheimer disease are more vulnerable to type 2 diabetes and the possibility of linkage between the processes responsible for loss of brain cells and beta-cells in these diseases.

pmid_21154789,Limitation of physical performance in a muscle fatiguing handgrip exercise is mediated by thalamo-insular activity.,,"In this study, we investigated central/supraspinal processes mediating cessation of a muscle fatiguing exercise. Fifteen male subjects performed 39 intermittent, isometric handgrip contractions (13 s on, 5-6 s off) with the dominant right hand while brain activation was assessed by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An adaptive, partly stochastic protocol was designed such that in approximately 50% of the contraction trials the required force could not be held until the end of the trial (task failure trial). Trials performed in compliance with the force requirements (succeeded trial) were compared with task failure trials concerning neural activity during a small time window before task failure occurred. The data revealed significantly increased activation contralaterally in both the mid/anterior insular cortex and the thalamus during the investigated time window in the case of subsequent task failure. In accordance with other studies investigating sensations that alert the organism to urgent homeostatic imbalance such as air hunger, hunger for food, and pain, we assume that an increased thalamo-insular activation in the context of a fatigue-induced handgrip exercise could reflect increased homeostatic disturbance in the exercising muscle and may be of essential importance by mediating task failure to maintain the integrity of the organism.

Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning and cognitive test to measure the differences in functional specialization and cognitive function. Functional specialization was evaluated by voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) method. Lower middle frontal gyrus VMHC in TCC practitioners compared to controls. For TCC practitioners, the longer they practice, the lower their VMHC in precentral and precuneus. TCC practitioners showed better cognition performance. Changed VMHC indicated that TCC practice could enhance functional specialization in the middle frontal cortex of practitioners, which may be associated with higher-order cognitive ability. ",
pmid_17071921,Navigation around London by a taxi driver with bilateral hippocampal lesions.,,"The time-scale of hippocampal involvement in supporting episodic memory remains a keenly debated topic, with disagreement over whether its role is temporary or permanent. Recently, there has been interest in how navigation by hippocampally-compromised patients in environments learned long ago speaks to this issue. However, identifying patients with damage that is primarily hippocampal, control subjects matched for navigation experience, and testing their in situ navigation, present substantial problems. We met these challenges by using a highly accurate and interactive virtual reality simulation of central London (UK) to assess the navigation ability of a licensed London taxi driver who had sustained bilateral hippocampal damage. In this test, patient TT and matched control taxi drivers drove a virtual London taxi along the streets they had first learned 40 years before. We found that the hippocampus is not required for general orientation in the city either in first person or survey perspectives, detailed topographical knowledge of landmarks and their spatial relationships, or even for active navigation along some routes. However, in his navigation TT was very reliant on main artery or 'A' roads, and became lost when navigation depended instead on non-A roads. We conclude that the hippocampus in humans is necessary for facilitating navigation in places learned long ago, particularly where complex large-scale spaces are concerned, and successful navigation requires access to detailed spatial representations.

pmid_19428407,Brain activation during immediate and delayed reaching in optic ataxia.,,"Patients with optic ataxia after lesions of the occipito-parietal cortex demonstrate gross deviations of movements to visual targets in their peripheral visual field. When the same patients point to remembered target locations their accuracy improves considerably. Taking into account opposite findings in a single patient suffering from visual form agnosia due to bilateral occipito-temporal lesions (D.F.), this paradoxical improvement was attributed to brain structures outside the dorsal stream, and supposed to be specifically associated with delayed movement execution. This conclusion was based on the still unverified assumption that the dorsal system is almost completely lacking any localization function in patients with optic ataxia who demonstrate the paradoxical delay effect. We thus investigated brain activity associated with immediately executed and delayed movements in a patient with optic ataxia due to extensive bilateral lesions (I.G.) and in 16 healthy subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Our analysis revealed robust and indistinguishable activation of intact dorsal occipital and parietal areas adjacent to the patient's lesions for both types of movements. In healthy subjects, we found the same visuomotor network activated during immediate and delayed movements as well as additionally higher signal increases for movements to visible targets than for delayed movements in bilateral occipito-parietal and occipito-temporal areas. Our results suggest that in healthy subjects as well as in the optic ataxia patient I.G. dorsal areas are not only involved in immediate but also in delayed reaching. This observation questions the hypothesis that residual visuospatial abilities in patients with optic ataxia could only be mediated by a system outside of the dorsal stream. ",

fMRI","Neuroimaging studies have started to explore the role of food characteristics (e.g., calorie-content) and psychological factors (e.g., restrained eating, craving) for the human appetitive system, motivated by the significant health implications of food-choice, overeating and overweight/obesity. However, one key aspect of modern food environments, food availability, especially of high energy foods, has not been adequately modeled in experimental research. Food that is immediately available for consumption could elicit stronger reward system activity and associated cognitive control than food that is not currently available for consumption and this could vary as a function of energy density. To examine this question, 32 healthy participants (16 women) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while passively viewing available foods - i.e. foods that could be eaten during and after the experiment - and unavailable foods of either high or low-caloric density in a 2 × 2 design. Available compared to unavailable foods elicited higher palatability ratings as well as stronger neural activation in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), amygdala, and left caudate nucleus as well as in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) - and thus structures implicated in reward and appetitive motivation as well as cognitive control, respectively. Availability effects in the caudate were mainly attributable to the high calorie condition (availability × calorie density interaction). These neuroimaging results support the contention that foods are particularly rewarding when immediately available and particularly so when high in caloric density. Thus, our results are consistent with health promoting interventions utilizing a nudging approach, i.e. aiming at decreasing accessibility of high calorie and increasing accessibility of low calorie foods in daily life. Results also imply that controlling/manipulating food availability may be an important methodological aspect in neuroscientific eating research. ",
pmid_23355265,Neural correlates of treatment response in depressed bipolar adolescents during emotion processing.,,"Depressive mood in adolescents with bipolar disorder (BDd) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, but we have limited information about neural correlates of depression and treatment response in BDd. Ten adolescents with BDd (8 females, mean age = 15.6 ± 0.9) completed two (fearful and happy) face gender labeling fMRI experiments at baseline and after 6-weeks of open treatment. Whole-brain analysis was used at baseline to compare their neural activity with those of 10 age and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). For comparisons of the neural activity at baseline and after treatment of youth with BDd, region of interest analysis for dorsal/ventral prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and amygdala activity, and significant regions identified by wholebrain analysis between BDd and HC were analyzed. There was significant improvement in depression scores (mean percentage change on the Child Depression Rating Scale-Revised 57 % ± 28). Neural activity after treatment was decreased in left occipital cortex in the intense fearful experiment, but increased in left insula, left cerebellum, and right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in the intense happy experiment. Greater improvement in depression was associated with baseline higher activity in ventral ACC to mild happy faces. Study sample size was relatively small for subgroup analysis and consisted of mainly female adolescents that were predominantly on psychotropic medications during scanning. Our results of reduced negative emotion processing versus increased positive emotion processing after treatment of depression (improvement of cognitive bias to negative and away from positive) are consistent with the improvement of depression according to Beck's cognitive theory.

pmid_23032389,Amygdala response to preattentive masked fear in children with conduct problems: the role of callous-unemotional traits.,,"In children with conduct problems, high levels of callous-unemotional traits are associated with amygdala hypoactivity to consciously perceived fear, while low levels of callous-unemotional traits may be associated with amygdala hyperactivity. Behavioral data suggest that fear processing deficits in children with high callous-unemotional traits may extend to stimuli presented below conscious awareness (preattentively). The authors investigated the neural basis of this effect. Amygdala involvement was predicted on the basis of its role in preattentive affective processing in healthy adults and its dysfunction in previous studies of conduct problems. Functional MRI was used to measure neural responses to fearful and calm faces presented preattentively (for 17 ms followed by backward masking) in boys with conduct problems and high callous-unemotional traits (N=15), conduct problems and low callous-unemotional traits (N=15), and typically developing comparison boys (N=16). Amygdala response to fearful and calm faces was predicted to differentiate groups, with the greatest response in boys with conduct problems and low callous-unemotional traits and the lowest in boys with conduct problems and high callous-unemotional traits. In the right amygdala, a greater amygdala response was seen in boys with conduct problems and low callous-unemotional traits than in those with high callous-unemotional traits. The findings were not explained by symptom levels of conduct disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, or depression. These data demonstrate differential amygdala activity to preattentively presented fear in children with conduct problems grouped by callous-unemotional traits, with high levels associated with lower amygdala reactivity. The study's findings complement increasing evidence suggesting that callous-unemotional traits are an important specifier in the classification of children with conduct problems. ",

response inhibition
stop-signal task","Drug addiction is characterized by impaired response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA), where the salience of drug cues is postulated to overpower that of other reinforcers with a concomitant decrease in self-control. However, the neural underpinnings of the interaction between the salience of drug cues and inhibitory control in drug addiction remain unclear. We developed a novel stop-signal functional magnetic resonance imaging task where the stop-signal reaction time (SSRT-a classical inhibitory control measure) was tested under different salience conditions (modulated by drug, food, threat, or neutral words) in individuals with cocaine use disorder (CUD; n = 26) versus demographically matched healthy control participants (n = 26). Despite similarities in drug cue-related SSRT and valence and arousal word ratings between groups, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) activity was diminished during the successful inhibition of drug versus food cues in CUD and was correlated with lower frequency of recent use, lower craving, and longer abstinence (Z > 3.1, P < 0.05 corrected). Results suggest altered involvement of cognitive control regions (e.g. dlPFC) during inhibitory control under a drug context, relative to an alternative reinforcer, in CUD. Supporting the iRISA model, these results elucidate the direct impact of drug-related cue reactivity on the neural signature of inhibitory control in drug addiction. ",

prefrontal cortex","Mindfulness--an attentive non-judgmental focus on present experiences--is increasingly incorporated in psychotherapeutic treatments as a skill fostering emotion regulation. Neurobiological mechanisms of actively induced emotion regulation are associated with prefrontally mediated down-regulation of, for instance, the amygdala. We were interested in neurobiological correlates of a short mindfulness instruction during emotional arousal. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated effects of a short mindfulness intervention during the cued expectation and perception of negative and potentially negative pictures (50% probability) in 24 healthy individuals compared to 22 controls. The mindfulness intervention was associated with increased activations in prefrontal regions during the expectation of negative and potentially negative pictures compared to controls. During the perception of negative stimuli, reduced activation was identified in regions involved in emotion processing (amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus). Prefrontal and right insular activations when expecting negative pictures correlated negatively with trait mindfulness, suggesting that more mindful individuals required less regulatory resources to attenuate emotional arousal. Our findings suggest emotion regulatory effects of a short mindfulness intervention on a neurobiological level. ",
pmid_23262175,Regulation of brain activity in the fusiform face and parahippocampal place areas in 7-11-year-old children.,,"Developmental studies have demonstrated that cognitive processes such as attention, suppression of interference and memory develop throughout childhood and adolescence. However, little is currently known about the development of top-down control mechanisms and their influence on cognitive performance. In the present study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate modulation of activity in the ventral visual cortex in healthy 7-11-year-old children and young adults. The participants performed tasks that required attention to either face (Fs task) or scene (Sf task) images while trying to ignore distracting scene or face images, respectively. A face-selective area in the fusiform gyrus (fusiform face area, FFA) and an area responding preferentially to scene images in the parahippocampal gyrus (parahippocampal place area, PPA) were defined using functional localizers. Children responded slower and less accurately in the tasks than adults. In children, the right FFA was less selective to face images and regulation of activity between the Fs and Sf tasks was weaker compared to adults. In the PPA, selectivity to scenes and regulation of activity, there according to the task demands were comparable between children and adults. During the tasks, children activated prefrontal cortical areas including the middle (MFG) and superior (SFG) frontal gyrus more than adults. Functional connectivity between the right FFA and left MFG was stronger in adults than children in the Fs task. Children, on the other hand, had stronger functional connectivity than adults in the Sf task between the right FFA and right PPA and between right MFG and medial SFG. There were no group differences in the functional connectivity between the PPA and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Together the results suggest that, in 7-11-year-old children, the FFA is still immature, whereas the selectivity to scenes and regulation of activity in the PPA is comparable to adults. The results also indicated functional immaturity of the PFC in children compared to adults and weaker connectivity between the PFC and the rFFA, explaining the weaker regulation of activity in the rFFA between the Fs and Sf tasks.

pmid_11848693,The role of the basal forebrain in episodic memory retrieval: a positron emission tomography study.,,"Human lesion data indicate that the basal forebrain or orbitofrontal cortex, or both, as well as medial temporal and diencephalic structures, is important for normal memory and that its disruption causes the pure amnesic syndrome, in which episodic memory is grossly impaired while other kinds of memory remain preserved. Among these critical areas, functional imaging studies have so far failed to detect activation of the basal forebrain, although activation in the nearby orbitofrontal cortex has been reported during episodic memory retrieval. We employed positron emission tomography to elucidate the neural basis of episodic memory recall utilizing two types of time cues and successfully detected activity in the basal forebrain for the first time. Specifically, recall of previously memorized words from temporal cues was associated with activity in the basal forebrain, right middle frontal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, and posterior cingulate gyrus, whereas their recall from person cues was associated with activity in the left insula, right middle frontal gyrus, and posterior cingulate gyrus. Furthermore, percentage increases of regional blood flow in the basal forebrain were correlated with behavioral data of successful recall. Our results provide clear evidence that the human basal forebrain has a specific role in episodic memory recall, especially that from time-contextual information. ",
pmid_22617632,Cognitive Behavioral Therapy increases pain-evoked activation of the prefrontal cortex in patients with fibromyalgia.,,"Interventions based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) are widely used to treat chronic pain, but the brain mechanisms responsible for these treatment effects are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to validate the relevance of the cortical control theory in response to an exposure-based form of CBT, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, in patients with chronic pain. Forty-three female patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia syndrome were enrolled in a randomized, 12-week, waiting-list controlled clinical trial (CBT n=25; controls n=18). CBT was administered in groups of six patients during 12 weekly sessions. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during pressure-evoked pain was assessed before and after treatment or the 12-week period. Self-report questionnaires of depression and anxiety were administered pre- and posttreatment as well as 3 months following end of treatment. Patients treated with CBT reported larger improvement of fibromyalgia on the Patient Global Impression of Change measure, and improved depression and anxiety symptoms, compared to the waiting-list controls. However, there were no effects on clinical pain or pain sensitivity measures. An analysis of fMRI scans revealed that CBT led to increased activations in the ventrolateral prefrontal/lateral orbitofrontal cortex; regions associated with executive cognitive control. We suggest that CBT changes the brain's processing of pain through an altered cerebral loop between pain signals, emotions, and cognitions; leading to increased access to executive regions for reappraisal of pain. Our data thereby support our hypothesis about the activation of a cortical control mechanism in response to CBT treatment in chronic pain. ",
pmid_22114078,Mindful attention reduces neural and self-reported cue-induced craving in smokers.,,"An emerging body of research suggests that mindfulness-based interventions may be beneficial for smoking cessation and the treatment of other addictive disorders. One way that mindfulness may facilitate smoking cessation is through the reduction of craving to smoking cues. The present work considers whether mindful attention can reduce self-reported and neural markers of cue-induced craving in treatment seeking smokers. Forty-seven (n = 47) meditation-naïve treatment-seeking smokers (12-h abstinent from smoking) viewed and made ratings of smoking and neutral images while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants were trained and instructed to view these images passively or with mindful attention. Results indicated that mindful attention reduced self-reported craving to smoking images, and reduced neural activity in a craving-related region of subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC). Moreover, a psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed that mindful attention reduced functional connectivity between sgACC and other craving-related regions compared to passively viewing smoking images, suggesting that mindfulness may decouple craving neurocircuitry when viewing smoking cues. These results provide an initial indication that mindful attention may describe a 'bottom-up' attention to one's present moment experience in ways that can help reduce subjective and neural reactivity to smoking cues in smokers.

pmid_18445735,Recognition of biological motion in children with autistic spectrum disorders.,,"It is widely accepted that autistic children experience difficulties in processing and recognizing emotions. Most relevant studies have explored the perception of faces. However, context and bodily gestures are also sources from which we derive emotional meanings. We tested 23 autistic children and 23 typically developing control children on their ability to recognize point-light displays of a person's actions, subjective states and emotions. In a control task, children had to recognize point-light displays of everyday objects. The children with autism only differed from the control children in their ability to name the emotional point-light displays. This suggests that children with autism can extract complex meanings from bodily movements but may be less sensitive to higher-order emotional information conveyed by human movement. The results are discussed in the context of a specific deficit in emotion perception in children with autism. ",
pmid_21078708,Aberrant brain activation during a working memory task in psychotic major depression.,,"The authors sought to better understand the neural circuitry associated with working memory deficits in psychotic major depression by examining brain function during an N-back task. Study subjects were 16 patients with psychotic major depression, 15 patients with nonpsychotic major depression, and 19 healthy comparison subjects. Functional MRI data were collected while participants responded to letter stimuli that were repeated from the previous trial (1-back) or the one before that (2-back). Relative to the healthy comparison group, both the psychotic and nonpsychotic major depression groups had significantly greater activation in the right parahippocampal gyrus during the 2-back task, and the psychotic major depression group showed this overactivation during the 1-back task as well. The nonpsychotic major depression group showed significantly lower activation than other groups in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and greater activation than the healthy comparison group in the superior occipital cortex. The psychotic major depression group was unique in showing greater activation than both other groups in the right temporoparietal junction, a cluster that also demonstrated connectivity with activation in the left prefrontal cortex. The psychotic major depression group showed aberrant parahippocampal activation at a lower demand level than observed in nonpsychotic major depression. While the nonpsychotic major depression group showed abnormalities in frontal executive regions, the psychotic major depression group showed abnormalities in temporoparietal regions associated with orienting to unexpected stimuli. Considering the functional connectivity of this cluster with left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex regions, these findings may reflect neural compensation for sensory gating deficits in psychotic major depression.

pmid_17073983,Deficient orthographic and phonological representations in children with dyslexia revealed by brain activation patterns.,,"The current study examined the neuro-cognitive network of visual word rhyming judgment in 14 children with dyslexia and 14 age-matched control children (8- to 14-year-olds) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In order to manipulate the difficulty of mapping orthography to phonology, we used conflicting and non-conflicting trials. The words in conflicting trials either had similar orthography but different phonology (e.g., pint-mint) or similar phonology but different orthography (e.g., jazz-has). The words in non-conflicting trials had similar orthography and phonology (e.g., gate-hate) or different orthography and phonology (e.g., press-list). There were no differences in brain activation between the controls and children with dyslexia in the easier non-conflicting trials. However, the children with dyslexia showed less activation than the controls in left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 45/44/47/9), left inferior parietal lobule (BA 40), left inferior temporal gyrus/fusiform gyrus (BA 20/37) and left middle temporal gyrus (BA 21) for the more difficult conflicting trials. For the direct comparison of conflicting minus non-conflicting trials, controls showed greater activation than children with dyslexia in left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 9/45/46) and medial frontal gyrus (BA 8). Children with dyslexia did not show greater activation than controls for any comparison. Reduced activation in these regions suggests that children with dyslexia have deficient orthographic representations in ventral temporal cortex as well as deficits in mapping between orthographic and phonological representations in inferior parietal cortex. The greater activation for the controls in inferior frontal gyrus could reflect more effective top-down modulation of posterior representations. ",

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging","Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) has been considered for development as a biomarker and analytical tool for evaluation of Parkinson's disease (PD). Here we utilized analysis of the amplitude low-frequency ﬂuctuations (ALFF) to determine changes in intrinsic neural oscillations in 72 patients with PD. Two different frequency bands (slow-5: 0.01-0.027 Hz; slow-4: 0.027-0.073 Hz) were analyzed. In the slow-5 band, PD patients compared with controls had increased ALFF values mainly in the caudate and several temporal regions, as well as decreased ALFF values in the cerebellum and the parieto-temporo-occipital cortex. Additionally, in the slow-4 band, PD patients relative to controls exhibited reduced ALFF value in the thalamus, cerebellum, and several occipital regions. Together, our data demonstrate that PD patients have widespread abnormal intrinsic neural oscillations in the corticostriatal network in line with the pathophysiology of PD, and further suggest that the abnormalities are dependent on speciﬁc frequency bands. Thus, frequency domain analyses of resting state BOLD signals may provide a useful means to study the pathophysiology of PD and the physiology of the brain's dopaminergic pathways. ",

We used seed-based resting fMRI to examine functional connectivity to bilateral pulvinar and MDN in 24 schizophrenic patients (SZ), 24 major depressive disorder patients (MDD), and 24 age-matched healthy controls. SZ had less connectivity than controls between the left pulvinar and precuneus, left ventral-lateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), and superior and medial-frontal regions, between the right pulvinar and right frontal pole, and greater connectivity between the right MDN and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). SZ had less connectivity than MDD between the left pulvinar and ventral anterior cingulate (vACC), left vlPFC, anterior insula, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and right hippocampus, between the right pulvinar and right PCC, and between the right MDN and right dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC). This is the first study to measure the functional connectivity to the higher order nuclei of the thalamus in both SZ and MDD. We observed less connectivity in SZ than MDD between pulvinar and emotional encoding regions, a directed effort region, and a region involved in representation and salience, and between MDN and a directed effort region.

fMRI","Previous research showed that human brain regions involved in reward and cognitive control are responsive to visually presented food stimuli, in particular high-energy foods. However, it is still to be determined whether the preference towards high-energy foods depends on their higher energy density (kcal/gram), or is based on the difference in energy content of the food items (total amount of kcal). Here we report the results of an fMRI study in which normal-weight healthy participants processed food images during a one-back task or were required to inhibit their response towards food stimuli during a Go/No-Go task. High-energy density (HD) and low-energy density (LD) foods were matched for energy content displayed. Food-related kitchen objects (OBJ) were used as control stimuli. The lateral occipital complex and the orbitofrontal cortex showed consistent higher activity in response to HD than LD foods, both during visual processing and response inhibition. This result suggests that images of HD foods, even when the amount of food shown is not associated with a higher energy content, elicit preferential visual processing - possibly involving attentional processes - and trigger a response from the reward system. We conclude that the human brain is able to distinguish food energy densities of food items during both active visual processing and response inhibition. ",
pmid_18422547,Pilot study of response inhibition and error processing in the posterior medial prefrontal cortex in healthy youth.,,"Recent neuroimaging work suggests that inhibitory and error processing in healthy adults share overlapping, but functionally distinct neural circuitries within the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC); however, it remains unknown whether the pMFC is differentially engaged by response inhibition compared to error commission in the developing brain. Developmental neuroimaging studies of response inhibition have found pMFC activation, but the possible contribution of error-related activation during inhibitory processing has not been well studied in youth. To examine the processing of correct response inhibition compared to errors in the developing brain, we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging scans in 11 healthy subjects, ages 8-14 years, during an antisaccade task while performance was monitored. Successful antisaccades activated the pre-supplementary motor area. In contrast, errors on the antisaccade task activated the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. The findings suggest the functional sub-specialization of inhibitory and error processing within the pMFC in this pilot sample of children and adolescents. Future neuroimaging studies of developing inhibitory control should examine both between correct and error trials. ",

Although brain abnormalities in patients with substance use disorders are caused by repetitive drug use and recover partly with drug abstinence, the relationship between brain activity and duration of illness or abstinence of gambling behavior in PG patients remains unclear. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we compared the brain activity of 23 PG patients recruited from a treatment facility with 27 demographically-matched healthy control subjects during reward anticipation, and examined the correlations between brain activity and duration of illness or abstinence in PG patients. During reward anticipation, PG patients showed decreased activity compared to healthy controls in a broad range of the reward system regions, including the insula cortex. In PG patients, activation in the left insula showed a significant negative correlation with illness duration. Our findings suggest that insular activation during reward anticipation may serve as a marker of progression of pathological gambling. ",
pmid_22684084,Brain fMRI study of crave induced by cue pictures in online game addicts (male adolescents).,,"To study crave-related cerebral regions induced by game figure cues in online game addicts. fMRI brain imaging was done when the subjects were shown picture cues of the WoW (World of Warcraft, Version: 4.1.014250) game. 10 male addicts of WoW were selected as addicts' group, and 10 other healthy male non-addicts who were matched by age, were used as non-game addicts' group. All volunteers participated in fMRI paradigms. WoW associated cue pictures and neutral pictures were shown. We examined functional cerebral regions activated by the pictures with 3.0 T Philips MRI. The imaging signals' database was analyzed by SPM5. The correlation between game craving scores and different image results were assessed. When the game addicts watch the pictures, some brain areas show increased signal activity namely: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral temporal cortex, cerebellum, right inferior parietal lobule, right cuneus, right hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, left caudate nucleus. But in these same brain regions we did not observe remarkable activities in the control group. Differential image signal densities of the addict group were subtracted from the health control group, results of which were expressed in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, inferior parietal lobe and inferior temporal gyrus, cerebellum, right insular and the right angular gyrus. The increased imaging signal densities were significant and positively correlated with the craving scale scores in the bilateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and right inferior parietal lobe. Craving of online game addicts was successfully induced by game cue pictures. Crave related brain areas are: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and right inferior parietal lobe. The brain regions are overlapped with cognitive and emotion related processing brain areas. ",

fMRI","Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common disabling psychiatric disorder associated with consistent deficits in error processing, inhibition and regionally decreased grey matter volumes. The diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, interviews and questionnaires, which are to some degree subjective and would benefit from verification through biomarkers. Here, pattern recognition of multiple discriminative functional and structural brain patterns was applied to classify adolescents with ADHD and controls. Functional activation features in a Flanker/NoGo task probing error processing and inhibition along with structural magnetic resonance imaging data served to predict group membership using support vector machines (SVMs). The SVM pattern recognition algorithm correctly classified 77.78% of the subjects with a sensitivity and specificity of 77.78% based on error processing. Predictive regions for controls were mainly detected in core areas for error processing and attention such as the medial and dorsolateral frontal areas reflecting deficient processing in ADHD (Hart et al., in Hum Brain Mapp 35:3083-3094, 2014), and overlapped with decreased activations in patients in conventional group comparisons. Regions more predictive for ADHD patients were identified in the posterior cingulate, temporal and occipital cortex. Interestingly despite pronounced univariate group differences in inhibition-related activation and grey matter volumes the corresponding classifiers failed or only yielded a poor discrimination. The present study corroborates the potential of task-related brain activation for classification shown in previous studies. It remains to be clarified whether error processing, which performed best here, also contributes to the discrimination of useful dimensions and subtypes, different psychiatric disorders, and prediction of treatment success across studies and sites.

pmid_19081385,The neural correlates of third-party punishment.,,"Legal decision-making in criminal contexts includes two essential functions performed by impartial ""third parties:"" assessing responsibility and determining an appropriate punishment. To explore the neural underpinnings of these processes, we scanned subjects with fMRI while they determined the appropriate punishment for crimes that varied in perpetrator responsibility and crime severity. Activity within regions linked to affective processing (amygdala, medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex) predicted punishment magnitude for a range of criminal scenarios. By contrast, activity in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex distinguished between scenarios on the basis of criminal responsibility, suggesting that it plays a key role in third-party punishment. The same prefrontal region has previously been shown to be involved in punishing unfair economic behavior in two-party interactions, raising the possibility that the cognitive processes supporting third-party legal decision-making and second-party economic norm enforcement may be supported by a common neural mechanism in human prefrontal cortex.

However, little is known about the neural substrate underlying the processing of dynamic facial expressions of emotion. We depicted the brain areas by using fMRI with 22 right-handed healthy subjects. The facial expressions are dynamically morphed from neutral to fearful or happy expressions. Two types of control stimuli were presented: (i) static facial expressions, which provided sustained fearful or happy expressions, and (ii) dynamic mosaic images, which provided dynamic information with no facial features. Subjects passively viewed these stimuli. The left amygdala was highly activated in response to dynamic facial expressions relative to both control stimuli in the case of fearful expressions, but not in the case of happy expressions. The broad region of the occipital and temporal cortices, especially in the right hemisphere, which included the activation foci of the inferior occipital gyri, middle temporal gyri, and fusiform gyri, showed higher activation during viewing of the dynamic facial expressions than it did during the viewing of either control stimulus, common to both expressions. In the same manner, the right ventral premotor cortex was also activated. These results identify the neural substrate for enhanced emotional, perceptual/cognitive, and motor processing of dynamic facial expressions of emotion. ",
pmid_22253926,Abnormal white matter integrity in adolescents with internet addiction disorder: a tract-based spatial statistics study.,,"Internet addiction disorder (IAD) is currently becoming a serious mental health issue around the globe. Previous studies regarding IAD were mainly focused on associated psychological examinations. However, there are few studies on brain structure and function about IAD. In this study, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate white matter integrity in adolescents with IAD. Seventeen IAD subjects and sixteen healthy controls without IAD participated in this study. Whole brain voxel-wise analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA) was performed by tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) to localize abnormal white matter regions between groups. TBSS demonstrated that IAD had significantly lower FA than controls throughout the brain, including the orbito-frontal white matter, corpus callosum, cingulum, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and corona radiation, internal and external capsules, while exhibiting no areas of higher FA. Volume-of-interest (VOI) analysis was used to detect changes of diffusivity indices in the regions showing FA abnormalities. In most VOIs, FA reductions were caused by an increase in radial diffusivity while no changes in axial diffusivity. Correlation analysis was performed to assess the relationship between FA and behavioral measures within the IAD group. Significantly negative correlations were found between FA values in the left genu of the corpus callosum and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders, and between FA values in the left external capsule and the Young's Internet addiction scale. Our findings suggest that IAD demonstrated widespread reductions of FA in major white matter pathways and such abnormal white matter structure may be linked to some behavioral impairments. In addition, white matter integrity may serve as a potential new treatment target and FA may be as a qualified biomarker to understand the underlying neural mechanisms of injury or to assess the effectiveness of specific early interventions in IAD.

Despite the wide use of Twitcher mice as experimental model for KD, the ultrastructure of this model is partial and mainly addressing peripheral nerves. More details are requested to elucidate the basis of the motor defects, which are the first to appear during KD onset. Here we use transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to focus on the alterations produced by KD in the lower motor system at postnatal day 15 (P15), a nearly asymptomatic stage, and in the juvenile P30 mouse. We find mild effects on motorneuron soma, severe ones on sciatic nerves and very severe effects on nerve terminals and neuromuscular junctions at P30, with peripheral damage being already detectable at P15. Finally, we find that the gastrocnemius muscle undergoes atrophy and structural changes that are independent of denervation at P15. Our data further characterize the ultrastructural analysis of the KD mouse model, and support recent theories of a dying-back mechanism for neuronal degeneration, which is independent of demyelination.

pmid_18439410,Both the hippocampus and striatum are involved in consolidation of motor sequence memory.,,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate the cerebral correlates of motor sequence memory consolidation. Participants were scanned while training on an implicit oculomotor sequence learning task and during a single testing session taking place 30 min, 5 hr, or 24 hr later. During training, responses observed in hippocampus and striatum were linearly related to the gain in performance observed overnight, but not over the day. Responses in both structures were significantly larger at 24 hr than at 30 min or 5 hr. Additionally, the competitive interaction observed between these structures during training became cooperative overnight. These results stress the importance of both hippocampus and striatum in procedural memory consolidation. Responses in these areas during training seem to condition the overnight memory processing that is associated with a change in their functional interactions. These results show that both structures interact during motor sequence consolidation to optimize subsequent behavior. ",

Little is known about the neural correlates of conflict detection and resolution in early childhood. In the current study, we investigated age-related change in neural recruitment during a blocked spatial-incompatibility task (Simon task) in children ages 5-10 years using fMRI. Cortical thickness was measured using structural MRI. Across all children, there was greater activation in right prefrontal and bilateral parietal cortices for incompatible than compatible conditions. In older children, compared with younger children, there was decreased activation and decreased gray matter thickness in the medial PFC. Thickness and activation changes across age were associated within participants, such that thinner cortex was associated with less activation in the rostral ACC. These findings suggest that developmental change in medial PFC activation supports performance on cognitive control tasks in early childhood. ",

This study examined the neural correlates of motor inhibition in a sample of symptom-free youths at familial risk for BD. 19 euthymic youths with BD, 13 asymptomatic youths with a first-degree relative with BD, and 21 healthy comparison children completed the stop signal task in a 3 T scanner. Children at familial risk for BD exhibited increased putamen activation during unsuccessful inhibition that distinguished them from both healthy and BD children. Youths with BD exhibited reduced activation of the right nucleus accumbens during unsuccessful inhibition as compared to the other participant groups. Striatal activation patterns differ between youths at risk for BD and healthy comparison children during a motor inhibition task. ",
pmid_19086201,Nouns and verbs in the brain: grammatical class and task specific effects as revealed by fMRI.,,"The wide variety of techniques and tasks used to study the neural correlates of noun and verb processing has resulted in a body of inconsistent evidence. We performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment to detect grammatical class effects that generalize across tasks. A total of 12 participants undertook a grammatical-class switching task (GCST), in which they were presented with a noun (or a verb) and were asked to retrieve the corresponding verb (or noun), and a classical picture naming task (PNT) widely used in the previous aphasiological and imaging literature. The GCST was explicitly designed to ensure control over confounding variables, such as stimulus complexity or imageability. Conjunction analyses of the haemodynamic responses measured in the two tasks indicated a shared verb-related activation of a dorsal premotor and posterior parietal network, pointing to a strong relationship between verb representation and action-oriented (visuo-)spatial knowledge. On the other hand, no brain area was consistently associated with nouns in both tasks. Moreover, there were task-dependent differences between noun and verb retrieval both at behavioural and at physiological level; the grammatical class that elicited the longest reaction times in both tasks (i.e., verbs in the PNT and nouns in the GCST) triggered a greater activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus. Therefore, we suggest that this area reflects a general increase in task demand rather than verb processing per se. ",
pmid_19201515,Differences in feedback- and inhibition-related neural activity in adult ADHD.,,"The objective of this study was to examine response inhibition- and feedback-related neural activity in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) using event-related functional MRI. Sixteen male adults with ADHD and 13 healthy/normal controls participated in this study and performed a modified Go/NoGo task. Behaviourally, attention and inhibition problems in the ADHD group were observed; no feedback-related differences between the groups were detected. The neuroimaging data showed that the ADHD group displayed more activation in the inferior frontal gyrus and putamen during response inhibition. During feedback-related processes, the ADHD group displayed less activation in the inferior frontal/orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus/nucleus accumbens, and caudate nucleus, but more activity in the inferior frontal gyrus. These results indicate that at least two distinguishable underlying brain networks related to response inhibition and feedback are altered in adults with ADHD. ",

Voxel-based morphometry","Different patterns of gray matter volume (GMV) abnormalities have been reported between chronic patients with deficit schizophrenia (DS), relative to nondeficit schizophrenia (NDS) patients. However, it is not clear whether these differences are characteristic to the pathophysiology of DS or due to the effects of medications or illness durations. To address this issue, GMV in 88 first-episode, drug-naive patients with schizophrenia (44 DS and 44 NDS), 67 of their first-degree relatives and 84 healthy controls were assessed using voxel- based morphometry (VBM) and compared between groups. Correlations between GMV and clinical symptoms in patients were also assessed. Compared to controls, DS patients displayed more severe GMV reduction in the cerebellar culmen than NDS patients. GMV reduction in culmen was also observed in the first-degree relatives of DS (but not NDS) patients, suggesting possible different genetic risk in DS and NDS. The left insula was significantly smaller in DS patients than both NDS patients and controls, and smaller GMV of this region was associated with more severe negative symptoms in patients. Our results collectively indicate that DS might represent a distinct subtype of schizophrenia from NDS and the GMV change in left insula may be a morphological signature of DS. ",

ventral striatum","Classical learning theories predict extinction after the discontinuation of reinforcement through prediction errors. However, placebo hypoalgesia, although mediated by associative learning, has been shown to be resistant to extinction. We tested the hypothesis that this is mediated by the suppression of prediction error processing through the prefrontal cortex (PFC). We compared pain modulation through treatment cues (placebo hypoalgesia, treatment context) with pain modulation through stimulus intensity cues (stimulus context) during functional magnetic resonance imaging in 48 male and female healthy volunteers. During acquisition, our data show that expectations are correctly learned and that this is associated with prediction error signals in the ventral striatum (VS) in both contexts. However, in the nonreinforced test phase, pain modulation and expectations of pain relief persisted to a larger degree in the treatment context, indicating that the expectations were not correctly updated in the treatment context. Consistently, we observed significantly stronger neural prediction error signals in the VS in the stimulus context compared with the treatment context. A connectivity analysis revealed negative coupling between the anterior PFC and the VS in the treatment context, suggesting that the PFC can suppress the expression of prediction errors in the VS. Consistent with this, a participant's conceptual views and beliefs about treatments influenced the pain modulation only in the treatment context. Our results indicate that in placebo hypoalgesia contextual treatment information engages prefrontal conceptual processes, which can suppress prediction error processing in the VS and lead to reduced updating of treatment expectancies, resulting in less extinction of placebo hypoalgesia.

The investigation of longer-term administration is necessary to determine whether benefits persist, whether they are similar to benefits provided by regular insulin, and whether either form of insulin therapy affects AD biomarkers. The present study aimed to determine whether four months of treatment with intranasal insulin detemir or regular insulin improves cognition, daily functioning, and AD biomarkers for adults with MCI or AD. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included an intent-to-treat sample consisting of 36 adults diagnosed with MCI or mild to moderate AD. Participants received placebo (n = 12), 40 IU of insulin detemir (n = 12), or 40 IU of regular insulin (n = 12) daily for four months, administered with a nasal delivery device. A cognitive battery was administered at baseline and after two and four months of treatment. MRI was administered for all participants and lumbar puncture for a subset (n = 20) at baseline and four months. The primary outcome was change from baseline to four months on a memory composite (sum of Z scores for delayed list and story recall). Secondary outcomes included: global cognition (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognition), daily functioning (Dementia Severity Rating Scale), MRI volume changes in AD-related regions of interest, and cerebrospinal fluid AD markers. The regular insulin treated group had better memory after two and four months compared with placebo (p < 0.03). No significant effects were observed for the detemir-assigned group compared with the placebo group, or for daily functioning for either group. Regular insulin treatment was associated with preserved volume on MRI. Regular insulin treatment was also associated with reduction in the tau-P181/Aβ42 ratio. Future research is warranted to examine the mechanistic basis of treatment differences, and to further assess the efficacy and safety of intranasal insulin. ",
pmid_29196699,Altered resting-state brain activity in Parkinson's disease patients with freezing of gait.,,"Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common and debilitating symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). The current study investigated alterations of resting-state spontaneous brain activity in PD patients with FOG. A total of 29 patients with FOG, 28 patients without FOG and 31 controls were included. All subjects underwent resting-state functional MRI, and the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) was calculated to measure the spontaneous brain activity. Between-group differences and correlations with FOG severity (both subjective and objective measures) were analyzed. Compared to those without FOG, patients with FOG showed increased ALFF in right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), as well as decreased ALFF in right superior frontal gyrus (SFG), bilateral cerebellum and left thalamus. Correlation analyses demonstrated that ALFF within the right SFG, right ACC and bilateral pallidum were positively correlated with FOG; while ALFF within the thalamus, putamen, cerebellum and sensorimotor regions were negatively correlated. Our results indicate that FOG is associated with dysfunction within frontal-parietal regions, along with increased inhibitory outputs from basal ganglia. Additionally, altered activity of cerebellum implicates its role in the pathophysiology of FOG. These findings provide further insight into the underlying neural mechanisms of FOG in PD patients. ",
pmid_22047967,Distinct neural substrates for semantic knowledge and naming in the temporoparietal network.,,"Patients with anterior temporal lobe (ATL) lesions show semantic and lexical retrieval deficits, and the differential role of this area in the 2 processes is debated. Functional neuroimaging in healthy individuals has not clarified the matter because semantic and lexical processes usually occur simultaneously and automatically. Furthermore, the ATL is a region challenging for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) due to susceptibility artifacts, especially at high fields. In this study, we established an optimized ATL-sensitive fMRI acquisition protocol at 4 T and applied an event-related paradigm to study the identification (i.e., association of semantic biographical information) of celebrities, with and without the ability to retrieve their proper names. While semantic processing reliably activated the ATL, only more posterior areas in the left temporal and temporal-parietal junction were significantly modulated by covert lexical retrieval. These results suggest that within a temporoparietal network, the ATL is relatively more important for semantic processing, and posterior language regions are relatively more important for lexical retrieval.

In this study, we looked at possible changes in gray and white matter and asked whether these changes are correlated to psychological measures. Twentynine players of violent videogames (mean daily playing time 4.7 h) and age matched controls were subjected to a battery of questionnaires assessing aggression, empathy, hostility, internet addiction and psychological well-being. Diffusion tensor and 3D T1-weighted MR images were obtained to examine gray (via voxel-based morphometry) and white (via tract-based spatial statistics) matter changes. Widespread regions of decreased gray matter in the players were found but no region showed increased intensity of gray matter. Density of gray matter showed a negative correlation with the total length of playing in years in the right posterior cingulate gyrus, left pre- and postcentral gyrus, right thalamus, among others. Furthermore, fractional anisotropy, a marker for white matter structure, was decreased in the left and right cingulum in the players. Both, gray and white matter changes correlated with measures of aggression, hostility, self esteem, and the degree of internet addiction. This study thus shows profound changes of brain structure as a function of excessive playing of violent video games. ",

Here we sought to quantitatively summarize the existing neuroimaging literature to investigate a) whether different emotion regulation strategies are based on different or the same neural networks; b) which brain regions in particular support the up- and down-regulation of emotions, respectively; and c) to which degree the neural networks realising emotion regulation depend on the stimulus material used to elicit emotions. The left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), the anterior insula and the supplementary motor area were consistently activated independent of the regulation strategy. VLPFC and posterior cingulate cortex were the main regions consistently found to be recruited during the up-regulation as well as the down-regulation of emotion. The down-regulation compared to the up-regulation of emotions was associated with more right-lateralized activity while up-regulating emotions more strongly modulated activity in the ventral striatum. Finally, the process of emotion regulation appeared to be unaffected by stimulus material. ",
pmid_25139883,Leptin is associated with exaggerated brain reward and emotion responses to food images in adolescent obesity.,,"In the U.S., an astonishing 12.5 million children and adolescents are now obese, predisposing 17% of our nation's youth to metabolic complications of obesity, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D). Adolescent obesity has tripled over the last three decades in the setting of food advertising directed at children. Obese adults exhibit increased brain responses to food images in motivation-reward pathways. These neural alterations may be attributed to obesity-related metabolic changes, which promote food craving and high-calorie food (HCF) consumption. It is not known whether these metabolic changes affect neural responses in the adolescent brain during a crucial period for establishing healthy eating behaviors. Twenty-five obese (BMI 34.4 kg/m2, age 15.7 years) and fifteen lean (BMI 20.96 kg/m2, age 15.5 years) adolescents underwent functional MRI during exposure to HCF, low-calorie food (LCF), and nonfood (NF) visual stimuli 2 h after isocaloric meal consumption. Brain responses to HCF relative to NF cues increased in obese versus lean adolescents in striatal-limbic regions (i.e., putamen/caudate, insula, amygdala) (P < 0.05, family-wise error [FWE]), involved in motivation-reward and emotion processing. Higher endogenous leptin levels correlated with increased neural activation to HCF images in all subjects (P < 0.05, FWE). This significant association between higher circulating leptin and hyperresponsiveness of brain motivation-reward regions to HCF images suggests that dysfunctional leptin signaling may contribute to the risk of overconsumption of these foods, thus further predisposing adolescents to the development of obesity and T2D.

Working memory","To study the neural mechanism for the impact of negative emotional distraction on working memory in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from exposure to motor vehicle accidents. Twenty PTSD patients and 20 healthy subjects were recruited. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate the effects of negative and neutral distractors on a delayed-response working memory task. All experiments were performed on a 3.0T MRI scanner, and the functional imaging data were analyzed using SPM8 software. The PTSD group showed poorer performance than the control group when the negative distractors were presented during the delay phase of working memory. The functional imaging indicated that, in the presence of negative relative to neutral distractors, the PTSD group showed higher activation in the emotion processing regions, including amygdala, precuneus and fusiform gyrus, but lower activation in the inferior frontal cortex, insula and left supramarginal gyrus than the control group. Based on the results that activation in the PTSD patients in the presence of negative distractors increased in the emotion-related brain regions but decreased in the working memory-related brain regions, we may conclude that the neural basis of working memory is impaired by negative emotion in PTSD patients.

Ventral striatum","Human social motivation is characterized by the pursuit of social reward and the avoidance of social punishment. The ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens (VS/Nacc), in particular, has been implicated in the reward component of social motivation, i.e., the 'wanting' of social incentives like approval. However, it is unclear to what extent the VS/Nacc is involved in avoiding social punishment like disapproval, an intrinsically pleasant outcome. Thus, we conducted an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study using a social incentive delay task with dynamic video stimuli instead of static pictures as social incentives in order to examine participants' motivation for social reward gain and social punishment avoidance. As predicted, the anticipation of avoidable social punishment (i.e., disapproval) recruited the VS/Nacc in a manner that was similar to VS/Nacc activation observed during the anticipation of social reward gain (i.e., approval). Stronger VS/Nacc activity was accompanied by faster reaction times of the participants to obtain those desired outcomes. This data support the assumption that dynamic social incentives elicit robust VS/Nacc activity, which likely reflects motivation to obtain social reward and to avoid social punishment. Clinical implications regarding the involvement of the VS/Nacc in social motivation dysfunction in autism and social phobia are discussed. ",
pmid_14741673,Functional association of the amygdala and ventral prefrontal cortex during cognitive evaluation of facial expressions primed by masked angry faces: an event-related fMRI study.,,"The present study examined the functional association of the amygdala and right ventral prefrontal cortex (PFC) during cognitive evaluation of facial expressions. A situation was created where emotional valence of the stimuli was unconsciously manipulated by using subliminal affective priming. Twelve healthy volunteers were asked to evaluate the facial expressions of a target face (500-ms duration) such as ""anger"", ""neutral"", or ""happy"". All target faces expressed relatively weak anger. Just before the presentation of the target face, a prime of three conditions of 35-ms duration, angry face, neutral face, and white blank was presented. The subjects could not consciously identify the primes in this procedure. Activity in the right amygdala was greater with subliminal presentation of the angry prime compared with subliminal presentation of a neutral face or white-blank stimuli. Most importantly, the degree of activation of the right amygdala was negatively correlated with that of the right ventral PFC only with the anger prime. Furthermore, activation of the amygdala was positively correlated with rate of judgment when the subjects recognized anger in the target faces. These results are discussed in terms of the functional association between the right PFC and the amygdala and its influence on cognitive processing. ",
pmid_19335390,Hyperfrontality in patients with schizophrenia during saccade and antisaccade tasks: a study with fMRI.,,"Antisaccadic eye movements, requiring inhibition of a saccade toward a briefly appearing peripheral target, are known to be impaired in schizophrenia. Previous neuroimaging studies have indicated that patients with schizophrenia show diminished activations in the frontal cortex and basal ganglia. These studies used target fixation as a baseline condition. However, if the levels of brain activities at baseline are not compatible between patients and healthy subjects, between-group comparison on antisaccade-related activations is consequently invalidated. One possibility is that patients with schizophrenia may present with greater activation during fixation than healthy subjects. In order to examine this possibility, here we investigated brain activities associated with antisaccade in the two groups without using target fixation at baseline. Functional brain images were acquired during prosaccades and antisaccades in 18 healthy subjects and 18 schizophrenia patients using a box-car functional magnetic resonance imaging design. Eye movements were measured during scanning. In the patient group, the elevated activities in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and thalamus, normally seen in antisaccade tasks relative to saccade tasks, were no longer observed. Moreover, in normal subjects, activities in the DLPFC and thalamus were greater during the antisaccade task than during the saccade task. In patients, no such difference was observed between the two tasks, suggesting that these brain regions are likely to be highly activated even by a simple task such as fixation. In particular, the DLPFC and thalamus in patients were not activated at a level commensurate with the difficulty of the tasks presented. From these results, it is suggested that schizophrenia entails dysfunctions in the fronto-striato-thalamo-cortical network associated with motor function control. ",
pmid_24471371,"Depression, stress, and anhedonia: toward a synthesis and integrated model.",,"Depression is a significant public health problem, but its etiology and pathophysiology remain poorly understood. Such incomplete understanding likely arises from the fact that depression encompasses a heterogeneous set of disorders. To overcome these limitations, renewed interest in intermediate phenotypes (endophenotypes) has resurfaced, and anhedonia has emerged as one of the most promising endophenotypes of depression. Here, a heuristic model is presented postulating that anhedonia arises from dysfunctional interactions between stress and brain reward systems. To this end, we review and integrate three bodies of independent literature investigating the role of (a) anhedonia, (b) dopamine, and (c) stress in depression. In a fourth section, we summarize animal data indicating that stress negatively affects mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic pathways critically implicated in incentive motivation and reinforcement learning. In the last section, we provide a synthesis of these four literatures, present initial evidence consistent with our model, and discuss directions for future research. ",

Using event-related fMRI, we have attempted to contribute to this debate by identifying brain regions associated with the successful recognition of famous faces from two different periods: ""Old"" faces of people who became famous in the 1960s-1970s and ""Recent"" faces of people who became famous in the 1990s. We demonstrate that the hippocampus is involved in the successful recognition of famous faces from both periods and does not appear to distinguish between these two periods. We also highlight a network of brain regions, including the left prefrontal cortex, the retrosplenial cortex, the temporo-parietal junction, the caudate and the right cerebellum, which is activated in association with successful recognition of famous faces. Finally, an analysis of the results obtained during a post hoc episodic recognition task shows the specific involvement of anterior hippocampus in the successful encoding of the unfamiliar faces, which were presented during the fame decision task, suggesting a functional distinction between anterior and posterior parts of the hippocampus, the former being specifically involved in successful episodic encoding and the latter being associated with successful retrieval of semantic information.

pmid_20166792,Neural correlates of response inhibition in pediatric bipolar disorder.,,"Pediatric bipolar disorder is characterized by core deficits in mood and executive function and commonly co-occurs with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We aimed to examine response inhibition in this population, as an element of executive function, which, if aberrant, may interfere with learning and information processing. Children (9-18 years) with bipolar I or II disorder (BD, n = 26) and age, gender, and intelligence quotient (IQ) comparable healthy children (HC, n = 22) without any psychopathology were given a standardized Go/NoGo computerized task measuring response inhibition. A whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) group analysis was performed using statistical parametric mapping software (SPM2) for comparing NoGo to Go epochs. There were no statistically significant group differences between groups in age, gender, or ethnicity. The BD group had high rates of co-morbid disorders, including 81% with ADHD, 62% with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and 46% with anxiety disorders. This BD group had fewer correct responses on Go (84% vs. 96%, T[46] = 3.35, p = 0.002) and overall (85% vs. 94%, T[46] = 4.12, p = 0.0002) trials as compared to the HC group. However, there were no statistically significant group differences in response inhibition on NoGo trials (p = 0.11). In the NoGo-Go contrast, the BD group showed increased neural activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) compared to HC (T[46] = 4.21, p < 0.001). During accurate NoGo but impaired Go trial performance, children with BD showed increased right DLPFC activation versus controls, suggesting increased recruitment of executive control regions for accurate response inhibition. Studies relating these results to mood regulation in pediatric BD are warranted. ",

It is known that visual and vestibular systems must work together to support equilibrium. However, the relationship between these two systems is not fully understood. In this work, we present the results of a study which identify the interaction of brain areas that are involved with concurrent visual and vestibular inputs. The visual and the vestibular systems were individually and simultaneously stimulated, using flickering checkerboard (without movement stimulus) and galvanic current, during experiments of functional magnetic resonance imaging. Twenty-four right-handed and non-symptomatic subjects participated in this study. Single visual stimulation shows positive blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses (PBR) in the primary and associative visual cortices. Single vestibular stimulation shows PBR in the parieto-insular vestibular cortex, inferior parietal lobe, superior temporal gyrus, precentral gyrus and lobules V and VI of the cerebellar hemisphere. Simultaneous stimulation shows PBR in the middle and inferior frontal gyri and in the precentral gyrus. Vestibular- and somatosensory-related areas show negative BOLD responses (NBR) during simultaneous stimulation. NBR areas were also observed in the calcarine gyrus, lingual gyrus, cuneus and precuneus during simultaneous and single visual stimulations. For static visual and galvanic vestibular simultaneous stimulation, the reciprocal inhibitory visual-vestibular interaction pattern is observed in our results. The experimental results revealed interactions in frontal areas during concurrent visual-vestibular stimuli, which are affected by intermodal association areas in occipital, parietal, and temporal lobes.

pmid_18486456,Naming dynamic and static actions: neuropsychological evidence.,,"There has been considerable interest in identifying the neural correlates of action naming, but the bulk of previous work on this topic has utilized static stimuli. Recent research comparing the visual processing of dynamic versus static actions suggests that these two types of stimuli engage largely overlapping neural systems, raising the possibility that the higher-order processing requirements for naming dynamic and static actions might not be very different. To explore this issue in greater depth, we developed the Dynamic Action Naming Test (DANT), which consists of 158 video clips 3-5s in length, for each of which the participant is asked to produce the most appropriate verb. We administered the DANT to 78 brain-damaged patients drawn from our Patient Registry, and to a demographically matched group of 50 normal participants. Out of the 16 patients who performed defectively on the DANT, nearly all (15/16) had damage in the left hemisphere. Lesion analysis indicated that the frontal operculum was the most frequent area of damage in the 15 patients; also, damage to the posterolateral temporal-occipital sector (in and near MT) was specifically related to defective dynamic action naming. Most of the brain-damaged participants (n=71) also received our Static Action Naming Test (SANT), and we found that performances on verb items that were common across the DANT and SANT were highly correlated (R=.91). Moreover, patients who failed the DANT almost invariably also failed the SANT. These findings lend further support to the hypothesis that there is considerable commonality in the neural systems underlying the use of verbs to orally name dynamic and static actions, a conclusion that is in turn compatible with the concept of ""representational momentum"". Our results also contribute more generally to the rapidly growing field of research on embodied cognition. ",

The goal of this study was to determine whether neural tissue density was also impaired in individuals abstinent from cocaine and whether any observed changes were associated with cognitive performance. A total of 73 participants were included: 24 active cocaine users, 24 abstainers (abstinent for at least 1 month), and 25 nondrug-abusing controls rigorously matched for age, gender, and IQ. All participants performed a cognitive assessment battery and received an MRI which was analyzed using voxel-based morphometry. The abstainers had significantly higher gray matter density than the current cocaine users in neocortical areas including the frontal and temporal cortex. In contrast to the users, there was no difference in white matter density in the abstainers relative to the controls. The abstainers performed better than current users on several behavioral tasks. Within users and abstainers, cortical density was correlated with performance on memory and reaction time tasks. Subcortical gray matter density was lower in both the users and abstainers relative to the controls. Within abstainers, subcortical tissue density was correlated with the ability to set-shift. These data suggest that individuals able to remain abstinent from cocaine for at least 1 month have elevated neocortical tissue density and perform better on multiple cognitive tests, relative to current cocaine users. Larger, longitudinal studies are needed to address this interaction between abstinence, cognition, and cortical tissue density directly. ",

The purpose of this article is to identify consistent patterns of anatomical alterations associated with migraine. First, 19 migraineurs without aura and 19 healthy participants were included in a brain imaging study. T1-weighted MRIs and DTI sequences were acquired and analyzed using VBM, SBM and tract-based spatial statistics. No significant alterations of gray matter (GM) volume, cortical thickness, cortical gyrification, sulcus depth and white-matter tract integrity could be observed. However, migraineurs displayed decreased white matter (WM) volume in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus. Second, a systematic review of the literature employing VBM, SBM and DTI was conducted to investigate brain anatomy in migraine. Meta-analysis was performed using Seed-based d Mapping via permutation of subject images (SDM-PSI) on GM volume, WM volume and cortical thickness data. Alterations of GM volume, WM volume, cortical thickness or white-matter tract integrity were reported in 72%, 50%, 56% and 33% of published studies respectively. Spatial distribution and direction of the disclosed effects were highly inconsistent across studies. The SDM-PSI analysis revealed neither significant decrease nor significant increase of GM volume, WM volume or cortical thickness in migraine. Overall there is to this day no strong evidence of specific brain anatomical alterations reliably associated to migraine. Possible explanations of this conflicting literature are discussed.

Both types of reasoning were characterized by activation of left lateral prefrontal and bilateral dorsal frontal, parietal, and occipital cortices. Neural responses unique to each type of reasoning determined from the Reasoning Type (deduction and induction) by Task (reasoning and baseline) interaction indicated greater involvement of left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 44) in deduction than induction, while left dorsolateral (BA 8/9) prefrontal gyrus showed greater activity during induction than deduction. This pattern suggests a dissociation within prefrontal cortex for deductive and inductive reasoning. ",

Exploring functional connectivity (FC) in drug-free schizophrenia patients before and after antipsychotic treatment can improve the understanding of antipsychotic drug mechanisms. A total of 17 drug-free patients with recurrent schizophrenia and 24 healthy controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. Long- and short-range FC strengths (FCS) were calculated for each participant. Compared with the controls, the patients at baseline exhibited increased long-range positive FCS (lpFCS) in the bilateral inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and decreased lpFCS in the brain regions of the default-mode network (DMN) regions and sensorimotor circuits of the brain. By contrast, increased short-range positive FCS was observed in the right IPL of the patients at baseline compared with the controls. After treatment with olanzapine, increased FC in the DMN and sensorimotor circuits of the brain was noted, whereas decreased FC was observed in the left superior temporal gyrus (STG). Moreover, the alterations of the FCS values and the reductions in symptom severity among the patients after treatment were correlated. The present study provides evidence that olanzapine normalizes the abnormalities of long- and short-range FCs in schizophrenia. FC reductions in the right IPL may be associated with early treatment response, whereas those in the left STG may be related to poor treatment outcome. ",
pmid_22797277,Ventral striatal activation during reward processing in subjects with ultra-high risk for schizophrenia.,,"Early dysfunction of the brain reward system in schizophrenia might be already recognized in the prodromal phase of this illness. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the blood oxygen level-dependent response in the ventral striatum (VS) of subjects with ultra-high risk for psychosis during the presentation of reward-indicating and loss-indicating stimuli. Thirteen prodromal patients (mean age: 25.5 ± 4.6 years) and 13 age-matched healthy volunteers participated in an incentive monetary delay task, in which visual cues predicted that a rapid response to a subsequent target stimulus will gain money, avoid losing money or have no consequence. Compared with the neutral condition, anticipation of reward loss-avoidance elicited significant activation of the VS in both healthy subjects and subjects with ultra-high risk for psychosis, but there was only a statistical tendency for less activation during loss-avoidance anticipation in prodromal compared to healthy subjects. This study provides a first weak hint, as revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging, for impaired activation of a central area of the mesolimbic dopaminergic brain reward system, the VS, already in subjects with ultra-high risk for psychosis, which is in line with results of patients with full-blown schizophrenic psychosis. This pilot study has, however, strong limitations, and its results need to be replicated first before they can be used e.g. for early recognition of patients in the schizophrenic prodrome. ",
pmid_22114193,Meditation experience is associated with differences in default mode network activity and connectivity.,,"Many philosophical and contemplative traditions teach that ""living in the moment"" increases happiness. However, the default mode of humans appears to be that of mind-wandering, which correlates with unhappiness, and with activation in a network of brain areas associated with self-referential processing. We investigated brain activity in experienced meditators and matched meditation-naive controls as they performed several different meditations (Concentration, Loving-Kindness, Choiceless Awareness). We found that the main nodes of the default-mode network (medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices) were relatively deactivated in experienced meditators across all meditation types. Furthermore, functional connectivity analysis revealed stronger coupling in experienced meditators between the posterior cingulate, dorsal anterior cingulate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (regions previously implicated in self-monitoring and cognitive control), both at baseline and during meditation. Our findings demonstrate differences in the default-mode network that are consistent with decreased mind-wandering. As such, these provide a unique understanding of possible neural mechanisms of meditation. ",
pmid_22877840,Functional anatomy of temporal organisation and domain-specificity of episodic memory retrieval.,,"Episodic memory provides information about the ""when"" of events as well as ""what"" and ""where"" they happened. Using functional imaging, we investigated the domain specificity of retrieval-related processes following encoding of complex, naturalistic events. Subjects watched a 42-min TV episode, and 24h later, made discriminative choices of scenes from the clip during fMRI. Subjects were presented with two scenes and required to either choose the scene that happened earlier in the film (Temporal), or the scene with a correct spatial arrangement (Spatial), or the scene that had been shown (Object). We identified a retrieval network comprising the precuneus, lateral and dorsal parietal cortex, middle frontal and medial temporal areas. The precuneus and angular gyrus are associated with temporal retrieval, with precuneal activity correlating negatively with temporal distance between two happenings at encoding. A dorsal fronto-parietal network engages during spatial retrieval, while antero-medial temporal regions activate during object-related retrieval. We propose that access to episodic memory traces involves different processes depending on task requirements. These include memory-searching within an organised knowledge structure in the precuneus (Temporal task), online maintenance of spatial information in dorsal fronto-parietal cortices (Spatial task) and combining scene-related spatial and non-spatial information in the hippocampus (Object task). Our findings support the proposal of process-specific dissociations of retrieval. ",
pmid_16960651,Insight and regional brain volumes in schizophrenia.,,"We have investigated the relationship between insight impairment and regional brain volumes (gray and white matter) in schizophrenia using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Fifty patients with schizophrenia were evaluated using the Scale for Unawareness of Mental Disorders. Magnetic resonance images were acquired, segmented and spatially normalized using optimized VBM routines. No significant inverse correlations were detected between insight impairment and gray or white matter volumes in the prefrontal region (where significant findings had been predicted a priori), or in any other brain areas. Our results do not support previous hypotheses suggesting a relationship between frontal lobe atrophy and impaired insight in patients with schizophrenia. ",
pmid_12598724,Neural response to pleasant stimuli in anhedonia: an fMRI study.,,"The aim of this study was to investigate the neural correlates of affect processing in depressed anhedonic patients and healthy controls. Whole brain functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained from seven females with a diagnosis of chronic unipolar major depression and high levels of anhedonia, and seven healthy females, while they were presented with positive valence and neutral images. Patients, compared to controls, showed decreased activation in medial frontal cortex, and increased activation in inferior frontal cortex, anterior cingulate, thalamus, putamen and insula. Reduced activation in medial frontal cortex may underlie abnormal positive affect processing in patients. Increases in neural activation in putamen and thalamus, previously found in transient sadness, and anterior cingulate could point to an involvement of these structures in anhedonia. ",
pmid_23200830,Regional homogeneity of resting-state brain abnormalities in bipolar and unipolar depression.,,"Bipolar disorder patients experiencing a depressive episode (BD-dep) without an observed history of mania are often misdiagnosed and are consequently treated as having unipolar depression (UD), leading to inadequate treatment and poor outcomes. An essential solution to this problem is to identify objective biological markers that distinguish BD-dep and UD patients at an early stage. However, studies directly comparing the brain dysfunctions associated with BD-dep and UD are rare. More importantly, the specificity of the differences in brain activity between these mental disorders has not been examined. With whole-brain regional homogeneity analysis and region-of-interest (ROI) based receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, we aimed to compare the resting-state brain activity of BD-dep and UD patients. Furthermore, we examined the specific differences and whether these differences were attributed to the brain abnormality caused by BD-dep, UD, or both. Twenty-one bipolar and 21 unipolar depressed patients, as well as 26 healthy subjects matched for gender, age, and educational levels, participated in the study. We compared the differences in the regional homogeneity (ReHo) of the BD-dep and UD groups and further identified their pathophysiological abnormality. In the brain regions showing a difference between the BD-dep and UD groups, we further conducted receptive operation characteristic (ROC) analyses to confirm the effectiveness of the identified difference in classifying the patients. We observed ReHo differences between the BD-dep and UD groups in the right ventrolateral middle frontal gyrus, right dorsal anterior insular, right ventral anterior insular, right cerebellum posterior gyrus, right posterior cingulate cortex, right parahippocampal gyrus, and left cerebellum anterior gyrus. Further ROI comparisons and ROC analysis on these ROIs showed that the right parahippocampal gyrus reflected abnormality specific to the BD-dep group, while the right middle frontal gyrus, the right dorsal anterior insular, the right cerebellum posterior gyrus, and the right posterior cingulate cortex showed abnormality specific to the UD group. We found brain regions showing resting state ReHo differences and examined their sensitivity and specificity, suggesting a potential neuroimaging biomarker to distinguish between BD-dep and UD patients. We further clarified the pathophysiological abnormality of these regions for each of the two patient populations. ",
pmid_21338692,Reduced striatal volume in cocaine-dependent patients.,,"Long-term cocaine consumption is associated with brain structural and functional changes. While the animal literature on cocaine use and dependence has traditionally focused on the striatum, previous human studies using voxel-based morphometry have reported reduced volumes of gray matter in several brain areas, but not in the striatum. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed with 20 cocaine-dependent patients and 16 healthy age-, education- and intelligence-matched control men. The cocaine-dependent group had lower gray matter volumes in the striatum and right supramarginal gyrus compared to controls. Within the cocaine-dependent group, years of cocaine use were inversely associated with the volume of the bilateral middle frontal gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus, parahippocampus, posterior cingulate, amygdala, insula, right middle temporal gyrus and cerebellum. These results show that cocaine dependence is associated with reduced gray matter volumes in the target structures of the dopaminergic system. These findings are the first to suggest reduced gray matter in the striatum by means of voxel-based morphometry in human users, thereby linking human results to animal models of addiction. In addition, the relationship between years of use and gray matter volumes in numerous brain regions are consistent with these volume reductions arising as a consequence of the cocaine use. ",

In this study, we investigated if longitudinal (12-week) Tai Chi Chuan and Baduanjin practice can improve memory function and modulate HPC resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC). Memory function measurements and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) were applied at the beginning and the end of the experiment. The results showed that (1) the memory quotient (MQ) measured by the Wechsler Memory Scale-Chinese Revision significantly increased after Tai Chi Chuan and Baduanjin practice as compared with the control group, and no significant difference was observed in MQ between the Tai Chi Chuan and Baduanjin groups; (2) rs-FC between the bilateral hippocampus and mPFC significantly increased in the Tai Chi Chuan group compared to the control group (also in the Baduanjin group compared to the control group, albeit at a lower threshold), and no significant difference between the Tai Chi Chuan and Baduanjin groups was observed; (3) rs-FC increases between the bilateral hippocampus and mPFC were significantly associated with corresponding memory function improvement across all subjects. Similar results were observed using the left or right hippocampus as seeds. Our results suggest that both Tai Chi Chuan and Baduanjin may be effective exercises to prevent memory decline during aging. ",

tinnitus","Hearing loss often triggers an inescapable buzz (tinnitus) and causes everyday sounds to become intolerably loud (hyperacusis), but exactly where and how this occurs in the brain is unknown. To identify the neural substrate for these debilitating disorders, we induced both tinnitus and hyperacusis with an ototoxic drug (salicylate) and used behavioral, electrophysiological, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques to identify the tinnitus-hyperacusis network. Salicylate depressed the neural output of the cochlea, but vigorously amplified sound-evoked neural responses in the amygdala, medial geniculate, and auditory cortex. Resting-state fMRI revealed hyperactivity in an auditory network composed of inferior colliculus, medial geniculate, and auditory cortex with side branches to cerebellum, amygdala, and reticular formation. Functional connectivity revealed enhanced coupling within the auditory network and segments of the auditory network and cerebellum, reticular formation, amygdala, and hippocampus. A testable model accounting for distress, arousal, and gating of tinnitus and hyperacusis is proposed. ",
pmid_22332246,fMRI reactivity to high-calorie food pictures predicts short- and long-term outcome in a weight-loss program.,,"Behavioral studies have suggested that food cues have stronger motivating effects in obese than in normal-weight individuals, which may be a risk factor underlying obesity. Previous cross-sectional neuroimaging studies have suggested that this difference is mediated by increased reactivity to food cues in parts of the reward system in obese individuals. To date, however, only a few prospective neuroimaging studies have been conducted to examine whether individual differences in brain activation elicited by food cues can predict differences in weight change. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate activation in reward-system as well as other brain regions in response to viewing high-calorie food vs. control pictures in 25 obese individuals before and after a 12-week psychosocial weight-loss treatment and at 9-mo follow-up. In those obese individuals who were least successful in losing weight during the treatment, we found greater pre-treatment activation to high-calorie food vs. control pictures in brain regions implicated in reward-system processes, such as the nucleus accumbens, anterior cingulate, and insula. We found similar correlations with weight loss in brain regions implicated by other studies in vision and attention, such as superior occipital cortex, inferior and superior parietal lobule, and prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, less successful weight maintenance at 9-mo follow-up was predicted by greater post-treatment activation in such brain regions as insula, ventral tegmental area, putamen, and fusiform gyrus. In summary, we found that greater activation in brain regions mediating motivational and attentional salience of food cues in obese individuals at the start of a weight-loss program was predictive of less success in the program and that such activation following the program predicted poorer weight control over a 9-mo follow-up period.

resting-state functional connectivity","Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective and rapid treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the neurobiological underpinnings of ECT are still largely unknown. Recent studies have identified dysregulated brain networks in MDD. Therefore, we hypothesized that ECT may improve MDD symptoms through reorganizing these networks. To test this hypothesis, we used resting-state functional connectivity to investigate changes to the intra- and internetwork architecture of five reproducible resting-state networks: the default mode network (DMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), executive control network (CON), salience network (SAL), and sensory-motor network. Twenty-three MDD patients were assessed before and after ECT, along with 25 sex-, age-, and education-matched healthy controls. At the network level, enhanced intranetwork connectivities were found in the CON in MDD patients after ECT. Furthermore, enhanced internetwork connectivities between the DMN and SAL, and between the CON and DMN, DAN, and SAL were also identified. At the nodal level, the posterior cingulate cortex had increased connections with the left posterior cerebellum, right posterior intraparietal sulcus (rpIPS), and right anterior prefrontal cortex. The rpIPS had increased connections with the medial PFC (mPFC) and left anterior cingulate cortex. The left lateral parietal had increased connections with the dorsal mPFC (dmPFC), left anterior prefrontal cortex, and right anterior cingulate cortex. The dmPFC had increased connection with the left anterolateral prefrontal cortex. Our findings indicate that enhanced interactions in intra- and internetworks may contribute to the ECT response in MDD patients. These findings provide novel and important insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying ECT. ",

Syndrome differentiation of TCM","Patients with major depression (MD) experience a variety of emotional and mental problems accompanied by characteristic clinical symptoms. Based on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) notions, the clinical appearance of MD can be divided into two syndromes, namely a deficiency pattern (DP) and an excess pattern (EP), depending on the patient's clinical symptoms, pulse, and lingual signs. Brain functional neuroimaging has demonstrated cerebral activity abnormalities in MD patients. However, such abnormalities have not been linked to particular symptoms of MD. The objective of this work was to compare functional connectivity of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) across MD patients with DP, MD patients with EP, and normal control (NC) subjects in a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) study. Participants (24 DP patients, 21 EP patients, and 20 NCs) underwent rs-fMRI scans. Whole-brain functional connectivity of a seed in the PCC was then mapped for each subject. Functional connectivity differences among the three studied groups were analyzed statistically. Compared to the NC group, DP patients had decreased functional connectivity of the PCC with the right middle temporal gyrus and bilateral precuneus, as well as increased functional connectivity of the PCC with the bilateral middle frontal gyrus. Meanwhile, compared to the NC group, the EP group had decreased functional connectivity of the PCC with both the middle temporal gyrus and bilateral precuneus, as well as increased functional connectivity of the PCC with the bilateral superior frontal gyrus. Relative to the DP group, the EP group had reduced functional connectivity of the PCC with the bilateral cerebellum and left superior frontal gyrus. Functional connectivity changes differ between MD patients with different TCM syndrome types, suggesting that the TCM clinical syndromes of MD are associated with correlates in cerebral functional activity.

pmid_24773415,Neuroimaging of executive function in survivors of pediatric brain tumors and healthy controls.,,"Research on the long-term sequelae of treatment for pediatric brain tumors has identified significant neurocognitive deficits experienced by many survivors. Despite indications of deficits based on cognitive assessment, the identification of specific neurobiological mechanisms of these deficits using neuroimaging techniques has yet to be considered. This study used norm-referenced standardized assessment and functional MRI (fMRI) to examine attention and executive functioning deficits of survivors of pediatric brain tumors, as compared with healthy children. Survivors of pediatric brain tumors performed more poorly than healthy children on measures of overall cognitive ability, attention, and executive function during testing, as well as on a working memory task during fMRI. Survivors showed lower blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in bilateral frontal regions associated with sustained attention (BA6/8) and greater BOLD signal in left cingulate regions associated with complex problem-solving and performance monitoring (BA32) during working memory task completion. Both group and brain activation accounted for significant variance in neurocognitive functioning. Survivors of pediatric brain tumor and healthy children differed in brain activation during completion of a working memory task, and brain activation was associated with deficits noted in testing. These findings may improve understanding of mechanisms of cognitive deficits and avenues for intervention for children with brain tumors. ",

stop-signal task","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by muscular atrophy, spasticity, and bulbar signs caused by loss of upper and lower motor neurons. Evidence suggests that ALS additionally affects other brain areas including premotor cortex and supplementary motor area. Here, we studied movement execution and inhibition in ALS patients using a stop-signal paradigm and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Seventeen ALS patients and 17 age-matched healthy controls performed a stop-signal task that required responding with a button press to a right- or left-pointing black arrow (go-stimuli). In stop-trials, a red arrow (stop-stimulus) was presented shortly after the black arrow indicating to withhold the prepared movement. Patients had by trend higher reaction times in go-trials but did not differ significantly in their inhibition performance. Patients showed stronger inhibition-related activity in inferior, superior, and middle frontal gyri as well as in putamen and pallidum. Error-related activity, conversely, was found to be stronger in healthy controls, particularly in the insula bilaterally. Patients also showed increased activity in the motor cortex during button presses. The results provide evidence for altered prefrontal and subcortical networks underlying motor execution, motor inhibition, and error monitoring in ALS. ",

The ReHo of the three groups was compared and Pearson correlation analysis was performed between the ReHo values and the clinical symptoms. (1) Significant differences were found in the right hippocampus, right parahippocampal gyrus, right Inferior orbitofrontal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, right inferior temporal gyrus, and right middle occipital gyrus across the three groups. (2) Compared to HC, the ReHo in the right parahippocampal gyrus in UD significantly increased. (3) When compared to HC, the ReHo in the right hippocampus in BD significantly increased. The ReHo in the right middle occipital gyrus decreased. (4) Compared to UD, BD exhibited significantly decreased ReHo in the right inferior temporal gyrus. No correlations were observed between the scores of 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDMD-24), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Young ﻿Mania ﻿Rating ﻿Scale (YMRS), and the ReHo values of altered brain regions between BD and UD. The results suggest that there was a considerable difference in the ReHo of brain among UD, BD, and HCs.

European Americans and Koreans played multiple trials of the Dictator Game with recipients who varied in emotional expression (excited, calm), race (White, Asian) and sex (male, female). Consistent with their culture's valued affect, European Americans trusted and gave more to excited than calm recipients, whereas Koreans trusted and gave more to calm than excited recipients. These findings held regardless of recipient race and sex. We then used fMRI to probe potential affective and mentalizing mechanisms. Increased activity in the nucleus accumbens (associated with reward anticipation) predicted giving, as did decreased activity in the right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ; associated with reduced belief prediction error). Ideal affect match decreased rTPJ activity, suggesting that people may trust and give more to strangers whom they perceive to share their affective values. ",
pmid_20096269,Atypical activation of the mirror neuron system during perception of hand motion in autism.,,"Disorders in the autism spectrum are characterized by deficits in social and communication skills such as imitation, pragmatic language, theory of mind, and empathy.

The between group comparison of the contrast [observation versus rest] provided evidence of a bilateral greater activation of inferior frontal gyrus during observation of human motion than during rest for the ASD group than for the TD group. This hyperactivation of the pars opercularis (belonging to the MNS) during observation of human motion in autistic subjects provides strong support for the hypothesis of atypical activity of the MNS that may be at the core of the social deficits in autism.

Videofluoroscopic swallowing study","To examine the swallowing characteristics in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dysphagia risk and explore brain activity changes using regional homogeneity (ReHo) with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). We included 28 patients with MCI and dysphagia risk and 17 age-matched older adults. All participants underwent neurological, cognitive examinations, and a videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS). We quantitatively analyzed the VFSS temporal and kinetic parameters of the 5- and 10-mL swallows. The participants underwent rs-fMRI, and the ReHo values were calculated. Differences in the swallowing physiology and rs-fMRI findings between participants with MCI and controls were analyzed. Correlation analyses were also conducted. Compared to the control group, patients with MCI and dysphagia risk had lower global cognition scores, longer 10-mL oral transit times (OTTs), and lower executive function scores. ReHo in the bilateral inferior occipital lobes (IOLs) and left prefrontal lobe decreased in patients with MCI and dysphagia risk compared to participants in the control group. In patients with MCI, the 10-mL OTT was negatively correlated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score, and the ReHo values were positive correlated with quantitative temporal swallowing measurements using canonical correlation analysis. Mediation analysis revealed that the ReHo values of the left and right IOL acted as significant mediators between the MoCA score and the 10-mL OTT. We found that individuals with MCI and dysphagia risk, verified by reduced MoCA scores, demonstrated prolonged OTTs when swallowing larger boluses compared with age-matched controls. There was a negative correlation between the MoCA score and 10-mL OTT, which was partially mediated by the left and right IOL ReHo values, suggesting that functional changes in the IOLs and left prefrontal lobe associated with oral swallowing status and cognitive level in individuals with MCI and dysphagia risk.

pmid_18985137,Attending to the present: mindfulness meditation reveals distinct neural modes of self-reference.,,"It has long been theorised that there are two temporally distinct forms of self-reference: extended self-reference linking experiences across time, and momentary self-reference centred on the present. To characterise these two aspects of awareness, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine monitoring of enduring traits ('narrative' focus, NF) or momentary experience ('experiential' focus, EF) in both novice participants and those having attended an 8 week course in mindfulness meditation, a program that trains individuals to develop focused attention on the present. In novices, EF yielded focal reductions in self-referential cortical midline regions (medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC) associated with NF. In trained participants, EF resulted in more marked and pervasive reductions in the mPFC, and increased engagement of a right lateralised network, comprising the lateral PFC and viscerosomatic areas such as the insula, secondary somatosensory cortex and inferior parietal lobule. Functional connectivity analyses further demonstrated a strong coupling between the right insula and the mPFC in novices that was uncoupled in the mindfulness group. These results suggest a fundamental neural dissociation between two distinct forms of self-awareness that are habitually integrated but can be dissociated through attentional training: the self across time and in the present moment.

Interventions that normalize activity in these areas may therefore be effective in treating anxiety disorders. Recently, there has been significant interest in the potential use of oxytocin (OT), as well as vasopressin (AVP) antagonists, as treatments for anxiety disorders. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, pharmaco- fMRI study, 153 men and 151 women were randomized to treatment with either 24 IU intranasal OT, 20 IU intranasal AVP, or placebo and imaged with fMRI as they played the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game with same-sex human and computer partners. In men, OT attenuated the fMRI response to unreciprocated cooperation (CD), a negative social interaction, within the amygdala and anterior insula. This effect was specific to interactions with human partners. In contrast, among women, OT unexpectedly attenuated the amygdala and anterior insula response to unreciprocated cooperation from computer but not human partners. Among women, AVP did not significantly modulate the response to unreciprocated cooperation in either the amygdala or the anterior insula. However, among men, AVP attenuated the BOLD response to CD outcomes with human partners across a relatively large cluster including the amygdala and the anterior insula, which was contrary to expectations. Our results suggest that OT may decrease the stress of negative social interactions among men, whereas these effects were not found in women interacting with human partners. These findings support continued investigation into the possible efficacy of OT as a treatment for anxiety disorders. ",

However, the neural bases that differentiate BED from other eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa (BN), are still under debate. Thirty-nine participants (HC, n=14; BN, n=13; BED, n=12) underwent functional MRI while performing a Stroop-Match-to-Sample task. This pilot study investigated how food images interfered with the behavioral performances and blood-oxygenation-level-dependent neuronal activity. Compared to healthy controls, participants with BN showed lower accuracy indicating impaired cognitive control over interference. Compared to healthy controls, participants with BED demonstrated stronger activations in the ventral striatum in response to food images. By contrast, participants with BN exhibited stronger activations in the premotor cortex and dorsal striatum. These aberrant ventral and dorsal frontostriatal activations in response to food images are associated with increased reward sensitivity and habitual binge-eating/purging behaviors in BED and BN. ",

We present a functional magnetic resonance imaging study of a GO-NOGO task in which successful performance required prepotent behaviors to be inhibited. Significant cingulate, pre-supplementary motor and insula hypoactivity was observed for both successful NOGOs and errors of commission in chronic cocaine users relative to cocaine-naive controls. This attenuated response, in the presence of comparable activation levels in other task-related cortical areas, suggests cortical and psychological specificity in the locus of drug abuse-related cognitive dysfunction. The results suggest that addiction may be accompanied by a disruption of brain structures critical for the higher-order, cognitive control of behavior. ",

Here, we show that 7 days of training on an n-back task led to substantial performance improvements in the trained task; furthermore, the experimental group showed cross-modal transfer, as compared with an active control group. In addition, there were two neural effects that emerged as a function of training: first, increased perfusion during task performance in selected regions, reflecting a neural response to cope with high task demand; second, increased blood flow at rest in regions where training effects were apparent. We also found that perfusion at rest was correlated with task proficiency, probably reflecting an improved neural readiness to perform. Our findings are discussed within the context of the available neuroimaging literature on n-back training. ",

The present study aimed to investigate how the resting state brain activities in healthy subjects were modulated by relatively long-period (30 min) acupuncture, a widely used modality in clinical practice. Transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation (TEAS) or intermittent minimal TEAS (MTEAS) were given for 30 min to 40 subjects. Functional MRI (fMRI) data were collected including the pre-stimulation resting state and the post-stimulation resting state, using dual-echo arterial spin labeling (ASL) techniques, representing both cerebral blood flow (CBF) signals and blood oxygen-dependent level (BOLD) signals simultaneously. Following 30 min TEAS, but not MTEAS, the mean global CBF decreased, and a significant decrease of regional CBF was observed in SI, insula, STG, MOG and IFG. Functional connectivity analysis showed more secure and spatially extended connectivity of both the DMN and SMN after 30 min TEAS. Our results implied that modulation of the regional brain activities and network connectivity induced by thirty minute TEAS may associate with the acupuncture-related therapeutic effects. Furthermore, the resting state regional CBF quantified by ASL perfusion fMRI may serve as a potential biomarker in future acupuncture studies. ",

Twenty patients with schizophrenia with a range of SW underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reward task. The brain activity underlying reward anticipation and outcome in schizophrenia was examined and compared to that of 12 healthy participants using a full factorial analysis. Region of interest (ROI) analyses of areas within the reward network and whole-brain analyses were conducted to reveal neural correlates of SW. Reward-related neural activity in schizophrenia was not significantly different from that of healthy participants; however, the patients with schizophrenia showed significantly diminished SW. Both ROI and whole-brain analyses confirmed that SW scores in the patients correlated significantly with activity, specifically in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), during both reward anticipation and reward outcome. This association was not seen in the healthy participants. In patients with schizophrenia, reduced activation of the dACC during multiple aspects of reward processing is associated with lower SW. As the dACC has been widely linked to coupling of reward and action, and the link to SW is apparent over anticipation and outcome, these findings suggest that SW deficits in schizophrenia may be attributable to reduced integration of environmental rewarding cues, motivated behaviour and reward outcome.

visceral pain","We explored sex differences in the neural mechanisms mediating placebo analgesia in an established visceral pain model involving painful rectal distensions in healthy volunteers. N = 15 men and N = 15 women underwent three consecutive functional magnetic resonance imaging sessions during which cued painful rectal distensions were delivered. After an adaptation session, positive expectations were induced with deceptive instructions regarding administration of an analgesic drug (placebo session). In the other session (control), truthful information about an inert substance was given. Sex differences in placebo-induced modulation of neural activation during anticipation and pain were analyzed along with ratings of expected and perceived pain intensity. Placebo-induced reductions in pain ratings were comparable between men and women. At the level of the brain, group comparisons with respect to differences between the placebo and control conditions revealed greater modulation of the posterior insula (regions-of-interest analysis: pFWE < 0.05) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (whole-brain analysis: p < 0.001, uncorrected) during pain anticipation in women. During pain, placebo-induced down-regulation of the insula was altered in women compared to men (ROI analysis: pFWE < 0.05). Our data provide first evidence supporting sex differences in pain-induced neural modulation during visceral placebo analgesia despite similar placebo-induced reductions in perceived pain intensity. These preliminary findings might contribute to elucidating mechanisms mediating placebo effects in clinical conditions associated with chronic abdominal pain such as in irritable bowel syndrome. ",
pmid_18356764,Morphometric brain abnormalities in boys with conduct disorder.,,"Children with the early-onset type of conduct disorder (CD) are at high risk for developing an antisocial personality disorder. Although there have been several neuroimaging studies on morphometric differences in adults with antisocial personality disorder, little is known about structural brain aberrations in boys with CD. Magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry were used to assess abnormalities in gray matter volumes in 23 boys ages 12 to 17 years with CD (17 comorbid for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) in comparison with age- and IQ-matched controls. Compared with healthy controls, mean gray matter volume was 6% smaller in the clinical group. Compared with controls, reduced gray matter volumes were found in the left orbitofrontal region and bilaterally in the temporal lobes, including the amygdala and hippocampus on the left side in the CD group. Regression analyses in the clinical group indicated an inverse association of hyperactive/impulsive symptoms and widespread gray matter abnormalities in the frontoparietal and temporal cortices. By contrast, CD symptoms correlated primarily with gray matter reductions in limbic brain structures. The data suggest that boys with CD and comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder show brain abnormalities in frontolimbic areas that resemble structural brain deficits, which are typically observed in adults with antisocial behavior.

pmid_16139997,Evaluation of a novel event-related parametric fMRI paradigm investigating prefrontal function.,,"While prefrontal pathology is considered to be a core feature in schizophrenia, evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies using cognitive activation tasks is less reliable in terms of demonstrating 'functional hypofrontality'. Here we present a new event-related fMRI paradigm specifically developed to assess the gradual recruitment of brain areas during verbal working memory (WM) by taking into account theoretical and pragmatic limitations of activation tools used in clinical cognitive neuroscience. We studied 15 healthy subjects during the performance of a WM task that required the manipulation of verbal information. We observed a robust recruitment of frontoparietal areas with increasing load. Comparing the two highest loads, we found further bilateral striatal activation. A median split into good and poor performers revealed significant positive correlations of prefrontal activation in the group of good performers and correlations with striato-thalamic activation in the poor-performance group, thus emphasizing a crucial role of subcortical structures for performance in highly demanding WM tasks. Because it induces a robust bilateral frontoparietal activation pattern along with performance-related effects of cerebral activation, we consider this paradigm to be suitable to test prefrontal function in schizophrenic patients during the manipulation of items held in WM.

Folic acid","Depression is characterized by significant and low mood. Classical antidepressants are still not adequate in treating depression because of undesirable side effects. Folic acid, a member of the vitamin B complex, in considered to be strongly associated with the function and development of the central nervous system. Thus, in this study, we established a model of depression through chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) in rats and assessed the antidepressant effects and mechanisms of folic acid. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: control, chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), CUMS treated with folic acid, and CUMS treated with citalopram. Rats were assessed in terms of weight change, open-field test and sucrose preference. Homocysteine, monoamine neurotransmitters, interleukin-6, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), β-endorphin levels in the serum and brains of rats were analysed. Folic acid exhibited antidepressant-like effects in open-field and sucrose preference tests. Folic acid treatment effectively increased the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters, BDNF and β-endorphin, interleukin-6 and homocysteine levels were also significantly suppressed by folic acid administration. These findings serve as preclinical evidence that folic acid plays an antidepressant-like role in several pathways involving monoamine neurotransmitters. Thus, folic acid may be used as a potential antidepressant. ",

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we undertook this study to investigate changes in brain activity following the administration of naproxen or placebo in patients with pain related to osteoarthritis (OA) of the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint. A placebo-controlled, double-blind, 2-period crossover study was performed in 19 individuals with painful OA of the CMC joint of the right hand. Following placebo or naproxen treatment periods, a functionally relevant task was performed, and behavioral measures of the pain experience were collected in identical fMRI examinations. Voxelwise and a priori region of interest analyses were performed to detect between-period differences in brain activity. Significant reductions in brain activity following treatment with naproxen, compared to placebo, were observed in brain regions commonly associated with pain perception, including the bilateral primary somatosensory cortex, thalamus, and amygdala. Significant relationships between changes in perceived pain intensity and changes in brain activity were also observed in brain regions previously associated with pain intensity. This study demonstrates the sensitivity of fMRI to detect the mechanisms underlying treatments of known efficacy. The data illustrate the enticing potential of fMRI as an adjunct to self-report for detecting early signals of efficacy of novel therapies, both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic, in small numbers of individuals with persistent pain.

Overweight","Prior research has suggested that obesity/overweight may be associated with deficits in executive function. If true, this has important clinical implications. In this review, we synthesize the current literature by conducting a meta-analysis of studies comparing executive functions in overweight/obese individuals to normal weight controls. We identified 72 studies-with 4904 overweight/obese participants-that met our inclusion criteria. Effect sizes were analyzed using the robust variance estimation random effects meta-regression technique. It was found that obese participants showed broad impairments on executive function, including on tasks primarily utilizing inhibition, cognitive flexibility, working memory, decision-making, verbal fluency, and planning; overweight participants only showed significant deficits in inhibition and working memory. The only moderator of effects of obesity to emerge significant was the task used to assess the respective executive function, which moderated effects of obesity on working memory and decision-making. There were not enough studies of overweight individuals to make strong claims about moderating effects in those studies. In sum, current evidence supports the existence of broad executive function deficits in obese individuals, and inhibition and working memory deficits in overweight individuals. ",

Our aim was to examine this phenomenon in the vestibular system using fMRI. Sixteen healthy subjects were asked to remember the feeling of a rotatory chair procedure in contrast to an identical situation at rest. Shortly afterwards they were asked to recall the vestibular experience in a 1.5-T scanner. The resulting activations were then compared with the responses of a galvanic vestibular control experiment and a rest condition. The vestibular recall showed significant bihemispheric activations in the inferior frontal gyri, the anterior operculum, the middle cingulate, the putamen, the globus pallidus, the premotor motor cortex, and the anterior insula. We found activations in regions known to play a role in spatial referencing, motor programs, and attention in the recall of vestibular sensations. But important known relay stations for the cortical processing of vestibular information showed neither relevant activations nor deactivations. ",

In this study, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the underlying neural mechanisms of depression in PD patients. Twenty-one healthy individuals and thirty-three patients with idiopathic PD, seventeen of whom were diagnosed with major depressive disorder, were recruited. An analysis of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) was performed on the whole brain of all subjects. Our results showed that depressed PD patients had significantly decreased ALFF in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) and the rostral anterior cingulated cortex (rACC) compared with non-depressed PD patients. A significant positive correlation was found between Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and ALFF in the DLPFC. The findings of changed ALFF in these brain regions implied depression in PD patients may be associated with abnormal activities of prefrontal-limbic network. ",

Schizophrenia","Heterogeneous findings across studies of structural abnormality in schizophrenia (SZ) have impeded the development a unified theory of white matter pathology. As a cardinal symptom of SZ, auditory verbal hallucination (AVH) has been suspected to be associated with improper communication among several brain regions, which might indicated white matter pathology. Participants comprised 25 first-episode (FE) patients with AVH, 25 patients without AVH and 25 healthy subjects. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures were calculated using the TBSS of FSL. Voxel-based ANOVA tests were performed among the three groups and threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) method correction was used for multiple comparisons. Voxel-based one-way ANOVA showed significant group effects for fractional anisotropy (FA) and radial diffusivity (RD) values. Post-hoc t-tests indicated that schizophrenia patients had lower FA and higher RD values in the internal capsule and anterior corona radiata than control subjects. Post-hoc analyses exhibited more widespread fiber disruptions in AVH patients than non-AVH patients. These results hinted on the important role of projection fiber disruption in schizophrenia patients. In addition, the current study also suggested that direct comparison between studies using patients with different symptom profiles should be interpreted with caution. ",

Although recent neuroimaging studies have reported changes in neural activity during facial emotion processing in males with CD or callous-unemotional (CU) traits, there have been no neuroimaging studies specifically assessing females with CD. We addressed this gap by investigating whether female adolescents with CD show atypical neural activation when processing emotional or neutral faces. We acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 20 female adolescents with CD and 20 female control participants while they viewed angry, sad, and neutral faces. An omnibus group (CD, control) by facial emotion (angry, sad, neutral) analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed main effects of facial emotion in superior temporal cortex, fusiform gyrus, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and insula, and main effects of group in medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and right anterior insula. Female participants with CD showed reduced medial OFC and increased anterior insula responses relative to healthy controls. There were no significant group × facial emotion interactions. Lifetime CD symptoms were negatively correlated with amygdala, superior temporal cortex, fusiform gyrus, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity for the contrast ""all-faces versus fixation."" CU traits were negatively correlated with fusiform gyrus activity for the contrast sad versus neutral faces. Females with CD showed atypical neural activation during the processing of all facial expressions, irrespective of valence. Our results demonstrate that severity of CD symptoms and CU traits is important in explaining abnormal patterns of neural activity. ",

Voxel-based morphometry","Chronic cocaine use is associated with structural brain abnormalities within prefrontal regions implicated in impulsivity. Despite high levels of impulsivity among persons who use cocaine, it is not known how reductions in gray matter volume (GMV) may relate to trait and behavioral measures of impulsivity. The sample included 39 active cocaine users (COC+) and 40 controls with no history of cocaine use (COC-). Participants had a brain scan on a 3 T MRI machine and completed out-of-scanner measures of trait impulsivity and delayed reward discounting. Whole-brain voxel-based morphometry was used to compare GMV between COC+ and COC-. Within regions that differed between groups, voxelwise correlations were conducted to examine the relationship between GMV and impulsivity. In a whole-brain analysis, COC+ had broad reductions in GMV compared to COC- in bilateral frontal, parietal, occipital, and cerebellar regions. Lower GMV correlated with trait impulsivity in lateral prefrontal regions and with delayed reward discounting in medial prefrontal regions, while lower GMV correlated with both measures in the posterior parietal cortex. COC+ demonstrated significantly higher impulsivity than COC- on all measures, but the nature of the correlation with GMV was similar in both groups. Reflecting the multi-faceted nature of impulsivity, these results show that trait and behavioral measures of impulsivity map differentially onto altered brain morphology. While the brain-behavior patterns were similar in COC+ and COC-, suggesting that impulsivity varies on a continuous spectrum, cocaine-related abnormalities in frontal-parietal brain systems may contribute to heightened impulsivity.

Specifically, behavioral studies have demonstrated the long-term efficacy of cognitive training of working memory functions, but the neural basis for this training have been studied only at short-term. Using fMRI, we investigate the cerebral changes produced by brief single n-back training immediately and 5 weeks after finishing the training. We used the data from a sample of 52 participants who were assigned to either an experimental condition (training group) or a no-contact control condition. Both groups completed three fMRI sessions with the same n-back task. Behavioral and brain effects were studied, comparing the conditions and sessions in both groups. Our results showed that n-back training improved performance in terms of accuracy and response speed in the trained group compared to the control group. These behavioral changes in trained participants were associated with decreased activation in various brain areas related to working memory, specifically the frontal superior/middle cortex, inferior parietal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and middle temporal cortex. Five weeks after training, the behavioral and brain changes remained stable. We conclude that cognitive training was associated with an improvement in behavioral performance and decreased brain activation, suggesting better neural efficiency that persists over time. ",

Our objective was to test the following hypothesis: that the salient neural activity associated with naming actions and spatial relations occurs in left frontal operculum and left parietal association cortices, but not in the left inferotemporal cortices (IT) or in the right parietal association cortices. There were two control tasks, one requiring a decision on the orientation of unknown faces (a standard control task in our laboratory) and another requiring the retrieval of words denoting the concrete entities used in the action and spatial relations tasks. In accordance with the hypothesis, both naming actions and spatial relations (using the face orientation task as control activated the left frontal operculum; naming actions also activated the left parietal lobe. However, sectors of the left posterior IT were also engaged in both naming actions and spatial relations. When the naming of concrete entities was subtracted from the naming of actions performed with such entities, area MT in the posterior temporo-occipital region was activated bilaterally. On the other hand, when naming of the concrete entities was subtracted from the naming of spatial relations, left parietal activation was found, and when two tasks of naming spatial relations were contrasted to each other bilateral parietal activation was seen, right when abstract stimuli were used and left when concrete objects were used. The activity in posterior IT is thought to be related to object processing and possibly name retrieval at a subconscious level. ",

A total of 48 drug-naive first-episode AOS as well as 31 sex-, age- and education-matched healthy controls were collected. Data were subjected to GFC, correlation analysis and support vector machine analyses. Compared with healthy controls, the AOS group exhibited increased GFC in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and decreased GFC in the right inferior temporal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus (STG)/precentral gyrus/postcentral gyrus, right posterior cingulate cortex /precuneus and bilateral cuneus. After the Benjamini-Hochberg correction, significantly negative correlations between GFC in the bilateral cuneus and Trail-Making Test: Part A (TMT-A) scores (r=-0.285, p=0.049), between GFC in the left STG/precentral gyrus/postcentral gyrus and TMT-A scores (r=-0.384, p=0.007), and between GFC in the right MFG and the fluency scores (r=-0.335, p=0.020) in the patients. GFC in the left STG/precentral gyrus/postcentral gyrus has a satisfactory accuracy (up to 86.08%) in classifying patients from controls. AOS shows abnormal GFC in the brain areas of multiple networks, which bears cognitive significance. These findings suggest potential abnormalities in processing self-monitoring and sensory prediction, which further elucidate the pathophysiology of AOS. ",

Systematic review","Reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) contributes to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is unclear whether there is a spatial-temporal-specific pattern of changed CBF in AD progression. We systematically screened literature databases for cross-sectional and longitudinal studies reporting resting CBF or CBF velocity (CBFv) among patients with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy controls (HCs). Standardised mean differences (SMDs) for CBF and mean differences (MDs) for CBFv were calculated. Quality assessments, meta-analysis, subgroup analysis, and meta-regression were subsequently performed (PROSPERO: CRD42020207548). Overall, 244 studies comprising 13,644 participants and 60 regions were included. Compared with HCs, AD subjects had decreased resting CBF throughout the brain (SMD range: -1.87 to -0.32), especially within the posterior cingulate and temporal-parietal regions. However, MCI subjects presented decreased CBF in ten regions with modest effects (SMD range: -0.86 to -0.25), especially in the precuneus. We identified the decreased CBF in the temporal, parietal, and hippocampal regions was associated with the lower AD Mini-Mental State Examination scores. Our findings suggest that the spatial-temporal pattern of CBF decreased from the precuneus, posterior cingulate and temporal-parietal regions to broader areas with progression from HC to MCI to AD, supporting the incorporation of CBF into the AD research framework.

pmid_17050709,Neural basis of dyslexia: a comparison between dyslexic and nondyslexic children equated for reading ability.,,"Adults and children with developmental dyslexia exhibit reduced parietotemporal activation in functional neuroimaging studies of phonological processing. These studies used age-matched and/or intelligence quotient-matched control groups whose reading ability and scanner task performance were often superior to that of the dyslexic group. It is unknown, therefore, whether differences in activation reflect simply poorer performance in the scanner, the underlying level of reading ability, or more specific neural correlates of dyslexia. To resolve this uncertainty, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging study, with a rhyme judgment task, in which we compared dyslexic children with two control groups: age-matched children and reading-matched children (younger normal readers equated for reading ability or scanner-performance to the dyslexic children). Dyslexic children exhibited reduced activation relative to both age-matched and reading-matched children in the left parietotemporal cortex and five other regions, including the right parietotemporal cortex. The dyslexic children also exhibited reduced activation bilaterally in the parietotemporal cortex when compared with children equated for task performance during scanning. Nine of the 10 dyslexic children exhibited reduced left parietotemporal activation compared with their individually selected age-matched or reading-matched control children. Additionally, normal reading fifth graders showed more activation in the same bilateral parietotemporal regions than normal-reading third graders. These findings indicate that the activation differences seen in the dyslexic children cannot be accounted for by either current reading level or scanner task performance, but instead represent a distinct developmental atypicality in the neural systems that support learning to read.

Using neuroimaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography, electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), many studies have demonstrated that abnormal functions of the central nervous system are closely associated with tinnitus. In our previous research, we reported using resting-state fMRI that several brain regions, including the rectus gyrus, cingulate gyrus, thalamus, hippocampus, caudate, inferior temporal gyrus, cerebellar hemisphere, and medial superior frontal gyrus, were associated with tinnitus distress and loudness. To reconfirm these results and probe target regions for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), we investigated the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) between younger tinnitus patients (<60 years old) and the age-matched controls using single-photon emission computed tomography and easy Z-score imaging system. Compared with that of controls, the rCBF of tinnitus patients was significantly lower in the bilateral medial superior frontal gyri, left middle occipital gyrus and significantly higher in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres and vermis, bilateral middle temporal gyri, right fusiform gyrus. No clear differences were observed between tinnitus patients with normal and impaired hearing. Regardless of the assessment modality, similar brain regions were identified as characteristic in tinnitus patients. These regions are potentially involved in the pathophysiology of chronic subjective tinnitus. ",

Functional imaging studies indicate regional brain activation abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia when processing facial emotion. However, findings have not been entirely consistent across different studies. Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses were conducted to examine brain activation during facial emotion processing in patients with schizophrenia, controls, and patients compared with controls. Secondary meta-analyses were performed to assess the contribution of task design and illness chronicity to the results reported. When processing facial expressions of emotions, both patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls activated the bilateral amygdala and right fusiform gyri. However, the extent of activation in these regions was generally much more limited in the schizophrenia samples. When directly compared with controls, the extent of activation in bilateral amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus and fusiform gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus, and lentiform nucleus was significantly less in patients. Patients with schizophrenia, but not controls, activated the left insula. A relative failure to recruit the amygdala in patients occurred regardless of whether the task design was explicit or implicit, while differences in fusiform activation were evident in explicit, not implicit, tasks. Restricting the analysis to patients with chronic illness did not substantially change the results. A marked underrecruitment of the amygdala, accompanied by a substantial limitation in activation throughout a ventral temporal-basal ganglia-prefrontal cortex ""social brain"" system may be central to the difficulties patients experience when processing facial emotion.

To investigate behavioral and neural correlates of emotional reactivity and cognitive regulation in patients and controls during processing of social and physical threat stimuli.

Academic psychology department. Fifteen adults with social anxiety disorder and 17 demographically matched healthy controls. Blood oxygen level-dependent signal and negative emotion ratings. Behaviorally, patients reported greater negative emotion than controls during social and physical threat but showed equivalent reduction in negative emotion following cognitive regulation. Neurally, viewing social threat resulted in greater emotion-related neural responses in patients than controls, with social anxiety symptom severity related to activity in a network of emotion- and attention-processing regions in patients only. Viewing physical threat produced no between-group differences. Regulation during social threat resulted in greater cognitive and attention regulation-related brain activation in controls compared with patients. Regulation during physical threat produced greater cognitive control-related response (ie, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) in patients compared with controls. Compared with controls, patients demonstrated exaggerated negative emotion reactivity and reduced cognitive regulation-related neural activation, specifically for social threat stimuli. These findings help to elucidate potential neural mechanisms of emotion regulation that might serve as biomarkers for interventions for social anxiety disorder. ",

However, direct evidence for abnormal dopamine-related subcortical-cortical circuitry disconnectivity is still lacking. The aim of this study was therefore to test dopamine-related substantia nigra (SN)-based striato-thalamo-cortical resting-state functional connectivity (FC) in SCZ. Based on our a priori hypothesis, we analyzed a large sample resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset from first-episode drug-naïve SCZ patients (n = 112) and healthy controls (n = 82) using the SN as the seed region for an investigation of striato-thalamo-cortical FC. This was done in the standard band of slow frequency oscillations and then in its subfrequency bands (Slow4 and Slow5). Results: The analysis showed in SCZ: (1) reciprocal functional hypo-connectivity between SN and striatum, with differential patterns for Slow5 and Slow4; (2) functional hypo-connectivity between striatum and thalamus, as well as functional hyper-connectivity between thalamus and sensorimotor cortical areas, specifically in Slow4; (3) correlation of thalamo-sensorimotor functional hyper-connectivity with psychopathological symptoms. Conclusions: We demonstrate abnormal dopamine-related SN-based striato-thalamo-cortical FC in slow frequency oscillations in first-episode drug-naive SCZ. This suggests that altered dopaminergic function in the SN leads to abnormal neuronal synchronization (as indexed by FC) within subcortical-cortical circuitry, complementing the dopamine hypothesis in SCZ on the regional level of resting-state activity.

Individual rsFC studies, however, vary greatly in their methods and findings. We searched for consistent patterns of network dysfunction in schizophrenia by using a coordinate-based meta-analysis. Fifty-six seed-based voxel-wise rsFC datasets from 52 publications (2115 patients and 2297 healthy controls) were included in this meta-analysis. Then, coordinates of seed regions of interest (ROI) and between-group effects were extracted and coded. Seed ROIs were categorized into seed networks by their location within an a priori template. Multilevel kernel density analysis was used to identify brain networks in which schizophrenia was linked to hyper-connectivity or hypo-connectivity with each a priori network. Our results showed that schizophrenia was characterized by hypo-connectivity within the default network (DN, self-related thought), affective network (AN, emotion processing), ventral attention network (VAN, processing of salience), thalamus network (TN, gating information) and somatosensory network (SS, involved in sensory and auditory perception). Additionally, hypo-connectivity between the VAN and TN, VAN and DN, VAN and frontoparietal network (FN, external goal-directed regulation), FN and TN, and FN and DN were found in schizophrenia. Finally, the only instance of hyper-connectivity in schizophrenia was observed between the AN and VAN. Our meta-analysis motivates an empirical foundation for a disconnected large-scale brain networks model of schizophrenia in which the salience processing network (VAN) plays the core role, and its imbalanced communication with other functional networks may underlie the core difficulty of patients to differentiate self-representation (inner world) and environmental salience processing (outside world).

It has recently been proposed that working memory might better be conceptualized as a limited resource that is distributed flexibly among all items to be maintained in memory. According to this view, the quality rather than the quantity of working memory representations determines performance. Here we consider behavioral and emerging neural evidence for this proposal. ",
pmid_21391761,Perception and conception: temporal lobe activity during complex discriminations of familiar and novel faces and objects.,,"Recent studies indicate that medial-temporal lobe (MTL) damage, either from focal lesions or neurodegenerative disease (e.g., semantic dementia), impairs perception as well as long-term declarative memory. Notably, however, these two patient groups show different performance for meaningful versus unfamiliar stimuli. In amnesics with nonprogressive MTL lesions, the use of meaningful stimuli, compared with unfamiliar items, boosted discrimination performance. In semantic dementia, a condition characterized by progressive deterioration of conceptual knowledge in the context of anterolateral temporal lobe damage, performance for meaningful stimuli was equivalent to that for unfamiliar items. To further investigate these findings, we scanned healthy volunteers while they performed odd-one-out discriminations involving familiar (i.e., meaningful/famous) and unfamiliar (i.e., novel) objects and faces and a baseline task of size oddity. Outside the scanner, volunteers' recognition memory was assessed. We found above baseline activity in the perirhinal cortex and hippocampus for all object and face discriminations and above baseline activity in the temporal pole for all face discriminations. The comparison of meaningful, relative to novel, faces and objects, revealed increased activity in the perirhinal cortex and hippocampus. In the temporal pole, we also found activity related to meaningfulness for faces but not for objects. Importantly, these meaningfulness effects were evident even for discriminations that were not subsequently well remembered, suggesting that the difference between meaningful and novel stimuli reflects perceptual or conceptual processes rather than solely incidental encoding into long-term memory. The results provide further evidence that the MTL is recruited during complex perceptual discrimination and additionally suggest that these structures are recruited in semantic processing of objects and faces.

Risk of bias","Methodological quality (risk of bias) assessment is an important step before study initiation usage. Therefore, accurately judging study type is the first priority, and the choosing proper tool is also important. In this review, we introduced methodological quality assessment tools for randomized controlled trial (including individual and cluster), animal study, non-randomized interventional studies (including follow-up study, controlled before-and-after study, before-after/ pre-post study, uncontrolled longitudinal study, interrupted time series study), cohort study, case-control study, cross-sectional study (including analytical and descriptive), observational case series and case reports, comparative effectiveness research, diagnostic study, health economic evaluation, prediction study (including predictor finding study, prediction model impact study, prognostic prediction model study), qualitative study, outcome measurement instruments (including patient - reported outcome measure development, content validity, structural validity, internal consistency, cross-cultural validity/ measurement invariance, reliability, measurement error, criterion validity, hypotheses testing for construct validity, and responsiveness), systematic review and meta-analysis, and clinical practice guideline. The readers of our review can distinguish the types of medical studies and choose appropriate tools. In one word, comprehensively mastering relevant knowledge and implementing more practices are basic requirements for correctly assessing the methodological quality. ",
pmid_20977554,Development of motion processing in children with autism.,,"Recent findings suggest that children with autism may be impaired in the perception of biological motion from moving point-light displays. Some children with autism also have abnormally high motion coherence thresholds. In the current study we tested a group of children with autism and a group of typically developing children aged 5 to 12 years of age on several motion perception tasks, in order to establish the specificity of the biological motion deficit in relation to other visual discrimination skills. The first task required the recognition of biological from scrambled motion. Three quasi-psychophysical tasks then established individual thresholds for the detection of biological motion in dynamic noise, of motion coherence and of form-from-motion. Lastly, individual thresholds for a task of static perception--contour integration (Gabor displays)--were also obtained. Compared to controls, children with autism were particularly impaired in processing biological motion in relation to any developmental measure (chronological or mental age). In contrast, there was some developmental overlap in ability to process other types of visual motion between typically developing children and the children with autism, and evidence of developmental change in both groups. Finally, Gabor display thresholds appeared to develop typically in children with autism. ",
pmid_23082797,Brain structure abnormalities in adolescent girls with conduct disorder.,,"Conduct disorder (CD) in female adolescents is associated with a range of negative outcomes, including teenage pregnancy and antisocial personality disorder. Although recent studies have documented changes in brain structure and function in male adolescents with CD, there have been no neuroimaging studies of female adolescents with CD. Our primary objective was to investigate whether female adolescents with CD show changes in grey matter volume. Our secondary aim was to assess for sex differences in the relationship between CD and brain structure. Female adolescents with CD (n = 22) and healthy control participants matched in age, performance IQ and handedness (n = 20) underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging. Group comparisons of grey matter volume were performed using voxel-based morphometry. We also tested for sex differences using archive data obtained from male CD and control participants. Female adolescents with CD showed reduced bilateral anterior insula and right striatal grey matter volumes compared with healthy controls. Aggressive CD symptoms were negatively correlated with right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex volume, whereas callous-unemotional traits were positively correlated with bilateral orbitofrontal cortex volume. The sex differences analyses revealed a main effect of diagnosis on right amygdala volume (reflecting reduced amygdala volume in the combined CD group relative to controls) and sex-by-diagnosis interactions in bilateral anterior insula. We observed structural abnormalities in brain regions involved in emotion processing, reward and empathy in female adolescents with CD, which broadly overlap with those reported in previous studies of CD in male adolescents. ",
pmid_21228156,Hypothetical and real choice differentially activate common valuation areas.,,"Hypothetical reports of intended behavior are commonly used to draw conclusions about real choices. A fundamental question in decision neuroscience is whether the same type of valuation and choice computations are performed in hypothetical and real decisions. We investigated this question using functional magnetic resonance imaging while human subjects made real and hypothetical choices about purchases of consumer goods. We found that activity in common areas of the orbitofrontal cortex and the ventral striatum correlated with behavioral measures of the stimulus value of the goods in both types of decision. Furthermore, we found that activity in these regions was stronger in response to the stimulus value signals in the real choice condition. The findings suggest that the difference between real and hypothetical choice is primarily attributable to variations in the value computations of the medial orbitofrontal cortex and the ventral striatum, and not attributable to the use of different valuation systems, or to the computation of stronger stimulus value signals in the hypothetical condition.

pmid_28558000,Working memory training in healthy young adults: Support for the null from a randomized comparison to active and passive control groups.,,"Training of working memory as a method of increasing working memory capacity and fluid intelligence has received much attention in recent years. This burgeoning field remains highly controversial with empirically-backed disagreements at all levels of evidence, including individual studies, systematic reviews, and even meta-analyses. The current study investigated the effect of a randomized six week online working memory intervention on untrained cognitive abilities in a community-recruited sample of healthy young adults, in relation to both a processing speed training active control condition, as well as a no-contact control condition. Results of traditional null hypothesis significance testing, as well as Bayesian factor analyses, revealed support for the null hypothesis across all cognitive tests administered before and after training. Importantly, all three groups were similar at pre-training for a variety of individual variables purported to moderate transfer of training to fluid intelligence, including personality traits, motivation to train, and expectations of cognitive improvement from training. Because these results are consistent with experimental trials of equal or greater methodological rigor, we suggest that future research re-focus on: 1) other promising interventions known to increase memory performance in healthy young adults, and; 2) examining sub-populations or alternative populations in which working memory training may be efficacious.

pmid_11501735,Learning related modulation of functional retrieval networks in man.,,"The medial temporal lobe has been implicated in studies of episodic memory tasks involving spatio-temporal context and object-location conjunctions. We have previously demonstrated that an increased level of practice in a free-recall task parallels a decrease in the functional activity of several brain regions, including the medial temporal lobe, the prefrontal, the anterior cingulate, the anterior insular, and the posterior parietal cortices, that in concert demonstrate a move from elaborate controlled processing towards a higher degree of automaticity. Here we report data from two experiments that extend these initial observations. We used a similar experimental approach but probed for effects of retrieval paradigms and stimulus material. In the first experiment we investigated practice related changes during recognition of object-location conjunctions and in the second during free-recall of pseudo-words. Learning in a neural network is a dynamic consequence of information processing and network plasticity. The present and previous PET results indicate that practice can induce a learning related functional restructuring of information processing. Different adaptive processes likely subserve the functional re-organisation observed. These may in part be related to different demands for attentional and working memory processing. It appears that the role(s) of the prefrontal cortex and the medial temporal lobe in memory retrieval are complex, perhaps reflecting several different interacting processes or cognitive components. We suggest that an integrative interactive perspective on the role of the prefrontal and medial temporal lobe is necessary for an understanding of the processing significance of these regions in learning and memory. It appears necessary to develop elaborated and explicit computational models for prefrontal and medial temporal functions in order to derive detailed empirical predictions, and in combination with an efficient use and development of functional neuroimaging approaches, to further the understanding of the processing significance of these regions in memory.

pmid_23793983,Chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea: a prospective study of brain activation changes and neurocognitive correlates.,,"Chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea (CIA) often occurs in pre- and peri-menopausal BC patients, and while cancer/chemotherapy and abrupt estrogen loss have separately been shown to affect cognition and brain function, studies of the cognitive effects of CIA are equivocal, and its effects on brain function are unknown. Functional MRI (fMRI) during a working memory task was used to prospectively assess the pattern of brain activation and deactivation prior to and 1 month after chemotherapy in BC patients who experienced CIA (n = 9), post-menopausal BC patients undergoing chemotherapy (n = 9), and pre- and post-menopausal healthy controls (n = 6 each). Neurocognitive testing was also performed at both time points. Repeated measures general linear models were used to assess statistical significance, and age was a covariate in all analyses. We observed a group-by-time interaction in the combined magnitudes of brain activation and deactivation (p = 0.006): the CIA group increased in magnitude from baseline to post-treatment while other groups maintained similar levels over time. Further, the change in brain activity magnitude in CIA was strongly correlated with change in processing speed neurocognitive testing score (r = 0.837 p = 0.005), suggesting this increase in brain activity reflects effective cognitive compensation. Our results demonstrate prospectively that the pattern of change in brain activity from pre- to post-chemotherapy varies according to pre-treatment menopausal status. Cognitive correlates add to the potential clinical significance of these findings. These findings have implications for risk appraisal and development of prevention or treatment strategies for cognitive changes in CIA. ",

Participants completed the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale (LEAS) and a functional magnetic resonance imaging trauma script-driven imagery paradigm. Patients with PTSD exhibited lower LEAS scores in comparison with the control group. LEAS scores correlated positively with BOLD activity during trauma script-imagery in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) in healthy controls, whereas LEAS scores correlated negatively with activation of vACC in individuals with PTSD. Patients with PTSD exhibit lower than average levels of emotional awareness. Levels of emotional awareness are differentially associated with vACC response during trauma script-driven imagery in healthy controls versus individuals with PTSD. ",
pmid_27385157,"Lorcaserin Administration Decreases Activation of Brain Centers in Response to Food Cues and These Emotion- and Salience-Related Changes Correlate With Weight Loss Effects: A 4-Week-Long Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind Clinical Trial.",,"Lorcaserin is a serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2c receptor agonist effective in treating obesity. Studies in rodents have shown that lorcaserin acts in the brain to exert its weight-reducing effects, but this has not yet been studied in humans. We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial with 48 obese participants and used functional MRI to study the effects of lorcaserin on the brain. Subjects taking lorcaserin had decreased brain activations in the attention-related parietal and visual cortices in response to highly palatable food cues at 1 week in the fasting state and in the parietal cortex in response to any food cues at 4 weeks in the fed state. Decreases in emotion- and salience-related limbic activity, including the insula and amygdala, were attenuated at 4 weeks. Decreases in caloric intake, weight, and BMI correlated with activations in the amygdala, parietal, and visual cortices at baseline. These data suggest that lorcaserin exerts its weight-reducing effects by decreasing attention-related brain activations to food cues (parietal and visual cortices) and emotional and limbic activity (insula, amygdala). Results indicating that baseline activation of the amygdala relates to increased efficacy suggest that lorcaserin would be of particular benefit to emotional eaters. ",

A total of 60 D-IBS patients were randomly allocated to the EA group (30 cases) and moxibustion group (30 cases). Before and after treatment, the gastrointestinal symptoms and psychological symptoms were scored by Visual Analogue Scale, Bristol Stool Form Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA), and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD); the expressions of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 5-HT3 receptor (5-HT3R), and 5-HT4 receptor (5-HT4R) in the sigmoid mucosal tissue were measured by immunohistochemical staining. Additionally, the effects on the functional brain areas of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insular cortex (IC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) were observed by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Compared with before treatment, both EA and moxibustion groups reported significant improvements in abdominal pain and abdominal bloating after treatment (P<0.01 or P<0.05). The moxibustion group reported greater improvements in defecation emergency, defecation frequency, and stool feature than the EA group (P<0.01). Both HAMA and HAMD scores were significantly decreased in the moxibustion group than in the EA group (P<0.01). Both groups demonstrated significantly reduced expressions of 5-HT, 5-HT3R and 5-HT4R in the colonic mucosa after treatment (P<0.01), with a greater reduction of 5-HT in the moxibustion group (P<0.05). Finally, decreased activated voxel values were observed in the left IC, right IC and PFC brain regions of patients in the moxibustion group under stimulation with 150 mL colorectal distension after treatment (P<0.05 or P<0.01), while in the EA group only PFC area demonstrated a reduction (P<0.05). Moxibustion can significantly improve the symptoms of D-IBS, suggesting that moxibustion may be a more effective therapy than EA for D-IBS patients. ",
pmid_10683393,"Recoding, storage, rehearsal and grouping in verbal short-term memory: an fMRI study.",,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of healthy volunteers is used to localise the processes involved in verbal short-term memory (VSTM) for sequences of visual stimuli. Specifically, the brain areas underlying (i) recoding, (ii) storage, (iii) rehearsal and (iv) temporal grouping are investigated. Successive subtraction of images obtained from five tasks revealed a network of left-lateralised areas, including posterior temporal regions, supramarginal gyri, Broca's area and dorsolateral premotor cortex. The results are discussed in relation to neuropsychological distinctions between recoding and rehearsal, previous neuroimaging studies of storage and rehearsal, and, in particular, a recent connectionist model of VSTM that makes explicit assumptions about the temporal organisation of rehearsal. The functional modules of this model are tentatively mapped onto the brain in light of the imaging results. Our findings are consistent with the representation of verbal item information in left posterior temporal areas and short-term storage of phonological information in left supramarginal gyrus. They also suggest that left dorsolateral premotor cortex is involved in the maintenance of temporal order, possibly as the location of a timing signal used in the rhythmic organisation of rehearsal, whereas Broca's area supports the articulatory processes required for phonological recoding of visual stimuli.

pmid_26403064,Decreased bilateral thalamic gray matter volume in first-episode schizophrenia with prominent hallucinatory symptoms: A volumetric MRI study.,,"Studies comparing gray matter (GM) volume of schizophrenic patients with or without auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) to that of normal controls remain controversial. This project aims to investigate changes of GM volumes of drug-naïve schizophrenic patients with and without AVHs. Eighteen first episode schizophrenic (FES) patients with AVHs, 18 FES patients without AVHs, and 18 healthy controls were scanned using structural MRI. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis was conducted to investigate changes of GM volume among the three groups. Patients with and without AVHs exhibited reduced GM volumes relative to normal controls in the left superior temporal gyrus, frontal regions, cerebellum and caudate. Further analysis of the GM of subcortical structures found that patients with AVHs had reduced thalamic volume than healthy controls. No significant difference was found between patients with and without AVHs. Significant correlation was found between the total scores of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and bilateral thalamic volume. ROC analysis of thalamic volumes of the patients with AVHs and normal controls showed that the area under the curve was 0.698 (P = 0.043). The decreased thalamic volumes might serve as a biomarker for discriminating FES AVHs patients from normals. ",
pmid_18320179,Neural correlates of decision making with explicit information about probabilities and incentives in elderly healthy subjects.,,"Recent functional neuroimaging and lesion studies demonstrate the involvement of the orbitofrontal/ventromedial prefrontal cortex as a key structure in decision making processes. This region seems to be particularly crucial when contingencies between options and consequences are unknown but have to be learned by the use of feedback following previous decisions (decision making under ambiguity). However, little is known about the neural correlates of decision making under risk conditions in which information about probabilities and potential outcomes is given. In the present study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) responses in 12 subjects during a decision making task. This task provided explicit information about probabilities and associated potential incentives. The responses were compared to BOLD signals in a control condition without information about incentives. In contrast to previous decision making studies, we completely removed the outcome phase following a decision to exclude the potential influence of feedback previously received on current decisions. The results indicate that the integration of information about probabilities and incentives leads to activations within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the posterior parietal lobe, the anterior cingulate and the right lingual gyrus. We assume that this pattern of activation is due to the involvement of executive functions, conflict detection mechanisms and arithmetic operations during the deliberation phase of decisional processes that are based on explicit information.

pmid_18004952,The hippocampus is preferentially associated with memory for spatial context.,,"Abstract The existence of a functional-anatomic dissociation for retrieving item versus contextual information within subregions of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is currently under debate. We used a spatial source memory paradigm during event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate this issue. At study, abstract shapes were presented to the left or right of fixation. During test, old and new shapes were presented at fixation. Participants responded whether each shape had been previously presented on the ""left,"" the ""right,"" or was ""new."" Activity associated with contextual memory (i.e., source memory) was isolated by contrasting accurate versus inaccurate memory for spatial location. Item-memory-related activity was isolated by contrasting accurate item recognition without contextual memory with forgotten items. Source memory was associated with activity in the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex. Although item memory was not associated with unique MTL activity at our original threshold, a region-of-interest (ROI) analysis revealed item-memory-related activity in the perirhinal cortex. Furthermore, a functional-anatomic dissociation within the parietal cortex for retrieving item and contextual information was not found in any of three ROIs. These results support the hypothesis that specific subregions in the MTL are associated with item memory and memory for context. ",
pmid_16998603,Human empathy through the lens of social neuroscience.,,"Empathy is the ability to experience and understand what others feel without confusion between oneself and others. Knowing what someone else is feeling plays a fundamental role in interpersonal interactions. In this paper, we articulate evidence from social psychology and cognitive neuroscience, and argue that empathy involves both emotion sharing (bottom-up information processing) and executive control to regulate and modulate this experience (top-down information processing), underpinned by specific and interacting neural systems. Furthermore, awareness of a distinction between the experiences of the self and others constitutes a crucial aspect of empathy. We discuss data from recent behavioral and functional neuroimaging studies with an emphasis on the perception of pain in others, and highlight the role of different neural mechanisms that underpin the experience of empathy, including emotion sharing, perspective taking, and emotion regulation.

pmid_20627131,The neural substrates of musical memory revealed by fMRI and two semantic tasks.,,"Recognizing a musical excerpt without necessarily retrieving its title typically reflects the existence of a memory system dedicated to the retrieval of musical knowledge. The functional distinction between musical and verbal semantic memory has seldom been investigated. In this fMRI study, we directly compared the musical and verbal memory of 20 nonmusicians, using a congruence task involving automatic semantic retrieval and a familiarity task requiring more thorough semantic retrieval. In the former, participants had to access their semantic store to retrieve musical or verbal representations of melodies or expressions they heard, in order to decide whether these were then given the right ending or not. In the latter, they had to judge the level of familiarity of musical excerpts and expressions. Both tasks revealed activation of the left inferior frontal and posterior middle temporal cortices, suggesting that executive and selection processes are common to both verbal and musical retrievals. Distinct patterns of activation were observed within the left temporal cortex, with musical material mainly activating the superior temporal gyrus and verbal material the middle and inferior gyri. This cortical organization of musical and verbal semantic representations could explain clinical dissociations featuring selective disturbances for musical or verbal material. ",

psychophysics","Mindfulness meditation reduces pain in experimental and clinical settings. However, it remains unknown whether mindfulness meditation engages pain-relieving mechanisms other than those associated with the placebo effect (e.g., conditioning, psychosocial context, beliefs). To determine whether the analgesic mechanisms of mindfulness meditation are different from placebo, we randomly assigned 75 healthy, human volunteers to 4 d of the following: (1) mindfulness meditation, (2) placebo conditioning, (3) sham mindfulness meditation, or (4) book-listening control intervention. We assessed intervention efficacy using psychophysical evaluation of experimental pain and functional neuroimaging. Importantly, all cognitive manipulations (i.e., mindfulness meditation, placebo conditioning, sham mindfulness meditation) significantly attenuated pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings when compared to rest and the control condition (p < 0.05). Mindfulness meditation reduced pain intensity (p = 0.032) and pain unpleasantness (p < 0.001) ratings more than placebo analgesia. Mindfulness meditation also reduced pain intensity (p = 0.030) and pain unpleasantness (p = 0.043) ratings more than sham mindfulness meditation. Mindfulness-meditation-related pain relief was associated with greater activation in brain regions associated with the cognitive modulation of pain, including the orbitofrontal, subgenual anterior cingulate, and anterior insular cortex. In contrast, placebo analgesia was associated with activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and deactivation of sensory processing regions (secondary somatosensory cortex). Sham mindfulness meditation-induced analgesia was not correlated with significant neural activity, but rather by greater reductions in respiration rate. This study is the first to demonstrate that mindfulness-related pain relief is mechanistically distinct from placebo analgesia. The elucidation of this distinction confirms the existence of multiple, cognitively driven, supraspinal mechanisms for pain modulation. Recent findings have demonstrated that mindfulness meditation significantly reduces pain. Given that the ""gold standard"" for evaluating the efficacy of behavioral interventions is based on appropriate placebo comparisons, it is imperative that we establish whether there is an effect supporting meditation-related pain relief above and beyond the effects of placebo. Here, we provide novel evidence demonstrating that mindfulness meditation produces greater pain relief and employs distinct neural mechanisms than placebo cream and sham mindfulness meditation. Specifically, mindfulness meditation-induced pain relief activated higher-order brain regions, including the orbitofrontal and cingulate cortices. In contrast, placebo analgesia was associated with decreased pain-related brain activation. These findings demonstrate that mindfulness meditation reduces pain through unique mechanisms and may foster greater acceptance of meditation as an adjunct pain therapy. ",

spatial working memory","Visuospatial working memory impairments have been implicated in the pathophysiology of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, most ADHD research has focused on the neural correlates of nonspatial mnemonic processes. This study examined brain activation and functional connectivity for visuospatial working memory in youth with and without ADHD. Twenty-four youth with ADHD and 21 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing an N-back test of working memory for spatial position. Block-design analyses contrasted activation and functional connectivity separately for high (2-back) and low (1-back) working memory load conditions versus the control condition (0-back). The effect of working memory load was modeled with linear contrasts. The 2 groups performed comparably on the task and demonstrated similar patterns of frontoparietal activation, with no differences in linear gains in activation as working memory load increased. However, youth with ADHD showed greater activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), greater functional connectivity between the left DLPFC and left intraparietal sulcus, and reduced left DLPFC connectivity with left midcingulate cortex and PCC for the high load contrast compared to controls (p < .01; k > 100 voxels). Reanalysis using a more conservative statistical approach (p < .001; k > 100 voxels) yielded group differences in PCC activation and DLPFC-midcingulate connectivity. Youth with ADHD show decreased efficiency of DLPFC for high-load visuospatial working memory and greater reliance on posterior spatial attention circuits to store and update spatial position than healthy control youth. Findings should be replicated in larger samples. ",

T1 weighted MRI
VBM","In childhood, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is reliably associated with reduced volume of the striatum. In contrast, striatal abnormalities are infrequently detected in voxel-based morphometry (VBM) neuroimaging studies of adults with ADHD. This discrepancy has been suggested to reflect normalisation of striatal morphology with age and prolonged treatment of symptoms. If so, this would indicate that while striatal abnormalities are linked to symptom expression in childhood, they cannot explain the persistence of these symptoms in adulthood. However, this may not be case. Instead, we hypothesized that the lack of evidence for striatal abnormalities in adult ADHD may reflect poor sensitivity of typical (T1-weighted) neuroimaging to detect subcortical differences. To address this, we acquired both magnetisation transfer (MT) saturation maps optimised for subcortical contrast, and conventional T1-weighted images in 30 adults with ADHD and 30 age, IQ, gender and handedness-matched controls. Using VBM of both datasets, we demonstrate volumetric reductions within the left ventral striatum on MT that are not observed on identically pre-processed T1-weighted images from the same participants. Nevertheless, both techniques reported similar sensitivity to cortical abnormalities in the right inferior parietal lobe. Additionally, we show that differences in striatal iron may potentially explain this reduced sensitivity of T1-weighted images in adults. Together, these findings indicate that prior VBM studies reporting no abnormalities in striatal volume in adult ADHD might have been compromised by the methodological insensitivity of T1-weighted VBM to subcortical differences, and that structural abnormalities of the striatum in ADHD do indeed persist into adulthood.

The children performed tasks that varied in visuospatial, orthographic, phonologic, and semantic processing demands. Enhanced activation of the left extrastriate cortex was found during all tasks in the dyslexic group. During orthographic processing, dyslexic children predominantly showed activation in the right prefrontal cortex, as also occurred during the visuo-spatial task. Normal readers also showed activation in the left prefrontal cortex. Dyslexic readers showed less activation of both the temporal and the prefrontal cortex during phonologic processing. The results suggest that dyslexic readers fail to use brain areas that are normally specialized in language processing, but rather use areas that underlie visuospatial processing. ",

This study sought to investigate the spectrum of volume alterations in a population of alcoholics with only alcohol dependence, polysubstance abusing alcoholics, and a comparison population of healthy controls. Thirty-seven 'pure' alcoholics, 93 polysubstance abusing alcoholics, and 69 healthy controls underwent structural T1 MRI scans. Voxel-based morphometry was performed to investigate gray matter alterations. Alcoholic dependent inpatients (both with and without a history of DSM-IV substance abuse/dependence diagnosis) displayed significant gray matter differences in the mesial region of the frontal lobe and right temporal lobe. 'Pure' alcoholics exhibited a pattern of subcortical changes similar to that seen in Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome when compared to polysubstance abusing alcoholics. 'Pure' alcoholics and polysubstance abusing alcoholics did not differ significantly in measures of cortical gray matter, liver function, or nutrition. These findings reinforce the accepted literature in regards to frontal lobe gray matter atrophy in alcohol dependence. This study calls for additional research in order to investigate the spectrum from uncomplicated alcoholism to Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome. Further research is needed to elucidate the exact cause of this pattern of differences and to determine what factors are responsible for the patterns of gray matter reduction or difference in 'pure' and polysubstance abusing alcoholics.

ACC theta power is associated with attention to emotional stimuli, and the ACC may mediate responses to frustrating stimuli. We used the affective Posner task, an attention paradigm that uses rigged feedback to induce frustration, to compare 20 medicated BD youth (14.9+/-2.0 years; 45% male) and 20 healthy controls (14.7+/-1.7 years; 45% male). MEG measured neuronal activity after negative and positive feedback; we also compared groups on reaction time, response accuracy, and self-reported affect. Patients met strict DSM-IV BD criteria and were euthymic. Controls had no psychiatric history. BD youth reported more negative affective responses than controls. After negative feedback, BD subjects, relative to controls, displayed greater theta power in the right ACC and bilateral parietal lobe. After positive feedback, BD subjects displayed lower theta power in the left ACC than did controls. Correlations between MEG, behavior, and affect were nonsignificant. In this first MEG study of BD youth, BD youth displayed patterns of theta oscillations in the ACC and parietal lobe in response to frustration-inducing negative feedback that differed from healthy controls. These data suggest that BD youth may display heightened processing of negative feedback and exaggerated self-monitoring after frustrating emotional stimuli. Future studies are needed with unmedicated bipolar youth, and comparison ADHD and anxiety groups. ",
pmid_25748858,The selective impairment of resting-state functional connectivity of the lateral subregion of the frontal pole in schizophrenia.,,"Although extensive resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) changes have been reported in schizophrenia, rsFC changes of the frontal pole (FP) remain unclear. The FP contains several subregions with different connection patterns; however, it is unknown whether the FP subregions are differentially affected in schizophrenia. To explore this possibility, we compared rsFC differences of the FP subregions between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. One hundred healthy controls and 91 patients with schizophrenia underwent resting-state functional MRI with a sensitivity-encoded spiral-in (SENSE-SPIRAL) imaging sequence to reduced susceptibility-induced signal loss and distortion. The FP was subdivided into the orbital (FPo), medial (FPm), and lateral (FPl) subregions. Mean fMRI time series were extracted for each FP subregion and entered into a seed-based rsFC analysis. The FP subregions exhibited differential rsFC patterns in both healthy controls and schizophrenia patients. Direct comparison between groups revealed reduced rsFCs between the bilateral FPl and several cognitive-related regions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, temporal cortex and inferior parietal lobule in schizophrenia. Although the FPl exhibited obvious atrophy, rsFC changes were unrelated to volumetric atrophy in the FPl, to duration of illness, and to antipsychotic medication dosage. No significant differences were observed in the rsFCs of other FP subregions. These findings suggest a selective (the lateral subregion) functional disconnection of the FP subregions in schizophrenia. ",

Sweet taste receptors","A gymnemic acids lozenge that blocks sweet taste receptors reduced the decision to consume candy in humans even before the candy was tasted after the gymnemic acids dose, suggesting that blocking sweet taste receptors reduces valuation of sweet foods. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test whether the gymnemic acids lozenge reduces reward region response to both intake and anticipated intake of high-sugar food, as well as ad lib candy intake relative to a placebo lozenge. Here we show for the first time that a gymnemic acids lozenge versus placebo lozenge significantly reduced activation in the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex in response to anticipated tastes of high-sugar milkshake, and significantly reduced dorsolateral prefrontal cortex response to tastes of milkshake. We also replicated evidence that a gymnemic acids lozenge versus placebo lozenge significantly reduced ad lib candy intake. Results also provide novel evidence that an initial taste of a high-sugar food increases reward region (i.e., caudate) response to anticipated intake of more of the high-sugar food. Results suggest that blocking sweet taste receptors not only reduces reward region response to intake of high-sugar foods, but also reduces anticipated reward from high-sugar foods, potentially via a feedback loop regarding the availability of sweet taste receptors to convey perceptual input regarding sweet tastes. Collectively, results imply that the gymnemic acids lozenge might prove useful in decreasing high-sugar food intake. ",
pmid_20619347,How specifically are action verbs represented in the neural motor system: an fMRI study.,,"Embodied accounts of language processing suggest that sensorimotor areas, generally dedicated to perception and action, are also involved in the processing and representation of word meaning. Support for such accounts comes from studies showing that language about actions selectively modulates the execution of congruent and incongruent motor responses (e.g., Glenberg & Kaschak, 2002), and from functional neuroimaging studies showing that understanding action-related language recruits sensorimotor brain areas (e.g. Hauk, Johnsrude, & Pulvermueller, 2004). In the current experiment we explored the basis of the neural motor system's involvement in representing words denoting actions. Specifically, we investigated whether the motor system's involvement is modulated by the specificity of the kinematics associated with a word. Previous research in the visual domain indicates that words denoting basic level category members lacking a specific form (e.g., bird) are less richly encoded within visual areas than words denoting subordinate level members (e.g., pelican), for which the visual form is better specified (Gauthier, Anderson, Tarr, Skudlarski, & Gore, 1997). In the present study we extend these findings to the motor domain. Modulation of the BOLD response elicited by verbs denoting a general motor program (e.g., to clean) was compared to modulation elicited by verbs denoting a more specific motor program (e.g., to wipe). Conform with our hypothesis, a region within the bilateral inferior parietal lobule, typically serving the representation of action plans and goals, was sensitive to the specificity of motor programs associated with the action verbs. These findings contribute to the growing body of research on embodied language representations by showing that the concreteness of an action-semantic feature is reflected in the neural response to action verbs.

pmid_26633037,Neurotoxic Effects of Anthracycline- vs Nonanthracycline-Based Chemotherapy on Cognition in Breast Cancer Survivors.,,"Chemotherapy exposure is a known risk factor for cancer-related cognitive impairments. Anthracycline-based regimens are commonly used chemotherapies that have been shown to be associated with cognitive impairment and brain changes in clinical studies. To directly compare the effects of anthracycline and nonanthracycline regimens on cognitive status and functional brain connectivity. In this observational study, we retrospectively examined cognitive and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired from 62 primary breast cancer survivors (mean [SD] age, 54.7 [8.5] years) who were more than 2 years off-therapy, on average. Twenty of these women received anthracycline-based chemotherapy as part of their primary treatment, 19 received nonanthracycline regimens, and 23 did not receive any chemotherapy. Participants were enrolled at a single academic institution (Stanford University) from 2008 to 2014, and the study analyses were performed at this time. Cognitive status was measured using standardized neuropsychological tests, and functional brain connectivity was evaluated using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging with a focus on the brain's default mode network. The anthracycline group demonstrated significantly lower verbal memory performance including immediate recall (F = 3.73; P = .03) and delayed recall (F = 11.11; P < .001) as well as lower left precuneus connectivity (F = 7.48; P = .001) compared with the other 2 groups. Patient-reported outcomes related to cognitive dysfunction (F = 7.27; P = .002) and psychological distress (F = 5.64; P = .006) were similarly elevated in both chemotherapy groups compared with the non-chemotherapy-treated controls. These results suggest that anthracyclines may have greater negative effects than nonanthracycline regimens on particular cognitive domains and brain network connections. Both anthracycline and nonanthracycline regimens may have nonspecific effects on other cognitive domains as well as certain patient reported outcomes. Further research is needed to identify potential methods for protecting the brain against the effects of various chemotherapeutic agents. ",
pmid_17578917,Placebo effects on human mu-opioid activity during pain.,,"Placebo-induced expectancies have been shown to decrease pain in a manner reversible by opioid antagonists, but little is known about the central brain mechanisms of opioid release during placebo treatment. This study examined placebo effects in pain by using positron-emission tomography with [(11)C]carfentanil, which measures regional mu-opioid receptor availability in vivo. Noxious thermal stimulation was applied at the same temperature for placebo and control conditions. Placebo treatment affected endogenous opioid activity in a number of predicted mu-opioid receptor-rich regions that play central roles in pain and affect, including periaqueductal gray and nearby dorsal raphe and nucleus cuneiformis, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, insula, rostral anterior cingulate, and lateral prefrontal cortex. These regions appeared to be subdivided into two sets, one showing placebo-induced opioid activation specific to noxious heat and the other showing placebo-induced opioid reduction during warm stimulation in anticipation of pain. These findings suggest that a mechanism of placebo analgesia is the potentiation of endogenous opioid responses to noxious stimuli. Opioid activity in many of these regions was correlated with placebo effects in reported pain. Connectivity analyses on individual differences in endogenous opioid system activity revealed that placebo treatment increased functional connectivity between the periaqueductal gray and rostral anterior cingulate, as hypothesized a priori, and also increased connectivity among a number of limbic and prefrontal regions, suggesting increased functional integration of opioid responses. Overall, the results suggest that endogenous opioid release in core affective brain regions is an integral part of the mechanism whereby expectancies regulate affective and nociceptive circuits. ",

social cognition
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex","Little is known about brain mechanisms recruited during the monitoring and appraisal of social conflicts--for instance, when individuals compete with each other for the same resources. We designed a novel experimental task inducing resource conflicts between two individuals. In an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) design, participants played with another human participant or against a computer, who across trials chose either different (no-conflict) or the same tokens (conflict trials) in order to obtain monetary gains. In conflict trials, the participants could decide whether they would share the token, and the resulting gain, with the other person or instead keep all points for themselves. Behaviorally, participants shared much more often when playing with a human partner than with a computer. fMRI results demonstrated that the dorsal mediofrontal cortex was selectively activated during human conflicts. This region might play a key role in detecting situations in which self- and social interest are incompatible and require behavioral adjustment. In addition, we found a conflict-related response in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex that correlated with measures of social relationship and individual sharing behavior. Taken together, these findings reveal a key role of these prefrontal areas for the appraisal and resolution of interpersonal resource conflicts. ",

Regional homogeneity
Schizophrenia","Several resting-state neuroimaging studies have indicated abnormal regional homogeneity (ReHo) in chronic schizophrenia; however, little work has been conducted to investigate naïve patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FES). Even less investigated is the association between ReHo measures and clinical symptom severity in naïve patients with FES. The current study evaluated ReHo alterations in whole brain, and assessed the correlations between ReHo measures and clinical variables in naïve patients with FES. Forty-four naïve patients with FES and 26 healthy controls (HC) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Group-level analysis was utilized to analyze the ReHo differences between FES and HC in a voxel-by-voxel manner. Severity of symptoms was evaluated using a five-factor model of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The correlation between the severity of symptoms and ReHo map was examined in patients using voxel-wise correlation analyses within brain areas that showed a significant ReHo alteration in patients compared with controls. Compared with the healthy control group, the FES group showed a significant decrease in ReHo values in the left medial frontal gyrus (MFG), right precentral gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus (STG), left left middle temporal gyrus (MTG), left thalamus, and significant increase in ReHo values in the left MFG, left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), left precuneus, and right lentiform nucleus (LN). In addition, the correlation analysis showed the PANSS total score negatively correlated with ReHo in the right precentral gyrus and positively correlated with ReHo in the left thalamus, the positive factor positively correlated with ReHo in the right thalamus, the disorganized/concrete factor positively correlated with ReHo in left posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG), the excited factor positively correlated with ReHo in the left precuneus, and the depressed factor negatively correlated with ReHo in the right postcentral gyrus and positively correlated with ReHo in the right thalamus. Our results indicate that widespread ReHo abnormalities occurred in an early stage of schizophrenic onset, suggesting a potential neural basis for the pathogenesis and symptomatology of schizophrenia.

pmid_20934190,Neural correlates of emotional processing in depression: changes with cognitive behavioral therapy and predictors of treatment response.,,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by the presence of disturbances in emotional processing. However, the neural correlates of these alterations, and how they may be affected by therapeutic interventions, remain unclear. The present study addressed these issues in a preliminary investigation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine neural responses to positive, negative, and neutral pictures in unmedicated MDD patients (N = 22) versus controls (N = 14). After this initial scan, MDD patients were treated with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and scanned again after treatment. Within regions that showed pre-treatment differences between patients and controls, we tested the association between pre-treatment activity and subsequent treatment response as well as activity changes from pre- to post-treatment. This study yielded three main findings. First, prior to treatment and relative to controls, patients exhibited overall reduced activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC), diminished discrimination between emotional and neutral items in the amygdala, caudate, and hippocampus, and enhanced responses to negative versus positive stimuli in the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL) and right dorsolateral PFC. Second, CBT-related symptom improvement in MDD patients was predicted by increased activity at baseline in ventromedial PFC as well as the valence effects in the ATL and dorsolateral PFC. Third, from pre- to post-treatment, MDD patients exhibited overall increases in ventromedial PFC activation, enhanced arousal responses in the amygdala, caudate, and hippocampus, and a reversal of valence effects in the ATL. The study was limited by the relatively small sample that was able to complete both scan sessions, as well as an inability to determine the influence of comorbid disorders within the current sample. Nevertheless, components of the neural networks corresponding to emotion processing disturbances in MDD appear to resolve following treatment and are predictive of treatment response, possibly reflecting improvements in emotion regulation processes in response to CBT.

pmid_14615423,Evidence for the involvement of the posterior parietal cortex in coordination of fingertip forces for grasp stability in manipulation.,,"Grasp stability during object manipulation is achieved by the grip forces applied normal to the grasped surfaces increasing and decreasing in phase with increases and decreases of destabilizing load forces applied tangential to the grasped surfaces. This force coordination requires that the CNS anticipates the grip forces that match the requirements imposed by the self-generated load forces. Here, we use functional MRI (fMRI) to study neural correlates of the grip-load force coordination in a grip-load force task in which six healthy humans attempted to lift an immovable test object held between the tips of the right index finger and thumb. The recorded brain activity was compared with the brain activity obtained in two control tasks in which the same pair of digits generated forces with similar time courses and magnitudes; i.e., a grip force task where the subjects only pinched the object and did not apply load forces, and a load force task, in which the subjects applied vertical forces to the object without generating grip forces. Thus neither the load force task nor the grip force task involved coordinated grip-load forces, but together they involved the same grip force and load force output. We found that the grip-load force task was specifically associated with activation of a section of the right intraparietal cortex, which is the first evidence for involvement of the posterior parietal cortex in the sensorimotor control of coordinated grip and load forces in manipulation. We suggest that this area might represents a node in the network of cortical and subcortical regions that implement anticipatory control of fingertip forces for grasp stability. ",

rs-fMRI","Anxiety disorders are very common in Parkinson's disease (PD), but neural mechanisms underlying these symptoms still remain elusive. In the present study, we aim to investigate the neural substrates in anxiety disorders in PD. The present study comprised 48 PD patients and 19 healthy subjects. According to a Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale cutoff score of 12, we divided PD patients into PD with anxiety groups (n = 15) and PD without anxiety groups (n = 33). Patients with apparent depressive symptoms and cognitive decline were excluded. All subjects were evaluated for demographic and clinical characteristics and performed 3.0 T MRI scans. The alterations of neural activity were examined utilizing resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) combined with the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) approach. Results of the analysis of covariance indicated that PD patients with anxiety displayed increased ALFF mainly in right cerebellar posterior lobe (CPL), bilateral brainstem and right orbitofrontal gyrus (OFG). Subsequently, the Spearman correlation demonstrated negative correlation between ALFF values in right cerebellum_9 and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores. Our findings demonstrated that anxiety disorders in PD were associated with increased activities in anxiety-related brain regions, including OFG, brainstem and CPL, using the ALFF approach. ",
pmid_17175179,Temporal dynamics of basal ganglia response and connectivity during verbal working memory.,,"Research on the neural basis of working memory (WM) has generally focused on neocortical regions; comparatively little is known about the role of subcortical structures. There is growing evidence that the basal ganglia are involved in WM, but their contribution to different component processes of WM is poorly understood. We examined the temporal dynamics of basal ganglia response and connectivity during the encoding, maintenance and response phases of a Sternberg WM task. During the encoding and maintenance phases, WM-load-dependent activation was observed in the left anterior caudate, anterior putamen and globus pallidus; activation in the right anterior caudate was observed only during the maintenance phase. During the response phase, the basal ganglia were equally active in both the high-load and low-load WM conditions. Caudate and putamen activations were primarily localized to the (rostral) associative parts of the basal ganglia, consistent with the putative role of these regions in cognitive processing. Effective connectivity analyses revealed increased WM-load-dependent interaction of the left anterior caudate with the left posterior parietal cortex during all three phases of the task; with the visual association cortex, including the fusiform gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus, only during the encoding phase; with the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during the encoding and maintenance phases; with the pre-supplementary motor area during the maintenance and response phases; and with the dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices only during the response phase. Taken together with known neuroanatomy of the basal ganglia, these results suggest that the anterior caudate helps to link signals in distinct functional networks during different phases of the WM task. Our study offers new insight into the integrative and adaptive role of the basal ganglia in higher cognitive function. ",
pmid_16934234,Neuropsychological deficits and neural dysfunction in familial dyslexia.,,"We report the neuropsychological profile and the pattern of brain activity during reading tasks in a sample of familial dyslexics. We studied our subjects with an in-depth neuropsychological assessment and with functional neuroimaging (fMRI) during word and pseudoword reading and false font string observations (baseline condition). The neuropsychological assessment revealed that familial dyslexia, in both persistent and compensated forms, is often associated with deficits in verbal short-term memory, phonological awareness and automatization abilities. The functional results showed a lack of activation in the posterior areas of the reading network. This study, together with the previously published VBM study (Brambati, S.M., Termine, C., Ruffino, M., Stella, G., Fazio, F., Cappa, S.F. and Perani, D., Regional reductions of gray matter volume in familial dyslexia, Neurology, 63 (2004) 742-5), provides a multiple modality evaluation of familial dyslexia. The neuropsychological assessment showed cognitive deficits associated with dyslexia that persist also in subjects with compensated reading deficit. Both the anatomical and the functional study point out a deficit in the posterior areas of the reading network. ",

Obesity
Pathogenesis","An excess of saturated fatty acids and simple sugars in the diet is a known environmental risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD) but the holistic view of the interacting processes through which such diet may contribute to AD pathogenesis is missing. We addressed this need through extensive analysis of published studies investigating the effects of western diet (WD) on AD development in humans and laboratory animals. We reviewed WD-induced systemic alterations comprising metabolic changes, induction of obesity and adipose tissue inflammation, gut microbiota dysbiosis and acceleration of systemic low-grade inflammation. Next we provide an overview of the evidence demonstrating that WD-associated systemic alterations drive impairment of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and development of neuroinflammation paralleled by accumulation of toxic amyloid. Later these changes are followed by dysfunction of synaptic transmission, neurodegeneration and finally memory and cognitive impairment. We conclude that WD can trigger AD by acceleration of inflammaging, and that BBB impairment induced by metabolic and systemic inflammation play the central role in this process. Moreover, the concurrence of neuroinflammation and Aβ dyshomeostasis, which by reciprocal interactions drive the vicious cycle of neurodegeneration, contradicts Aβ as the primary trigger of AD. Given that in 2019 the World Health Organization recommended focusing on modifiable risk factors in AD prevention, this overview of the sequential, complex pathomechanisms initiated by WD, which can lead from peripheral disturbances to neurodegeneration, can support future prevention strategies.

The neurobiological underpinnings of IAD should be studied to unravel the potential heterogeneity. This study was set to investigate the error-monitoring ability in IAD subjects. Fifteen IAD subjects and 15 healthy controls (HC) participated in this study. Participants were asked to perform a fast Stroop task that may show error responses. Behavioral and neurobiological results in relation to error responses were compared between IAD subjects and HC. Compared to HC, IAD subjects showed increased activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and decreased activation in the orbitofrontal cortex following error responses. Significant correlation was found between ACC activation and the Internet addiction test scores. IAD subjects show an impaired error-monitoring ability compared to HC, which can be detected by the hyperactivation in ACC in error responses. ",
pmid_22535907,What the human brain likes about facial motion.,,"Facial motion carries essential information about other people's emotions and intentions. Most previous studies have suggested that facial motion is mainly processed in the superior temporal sulcus (STS), but several recent studies have also shown involvement of ventral temporal face-sensitive regions. Up to now, it is not known whether the increased response to facial motion is due to an increased amount of static information in the stimulus, to the deformation of the face over time, or to increased attentional demands. We presented nonrigidly moving faces and control stimuli to participants performing a demanding task unrelated to the face stimuli. We manipulated the amount of static information by using movies with different frame rates. The fluidity of the motion was manipulated by presenting movies with frames either in the order in which they were recorded or in scrambled order. Results confirm higher activation for moving compared with static faces in STS and under certain conditions in ventral temporal face-sensitive regions. Activation was maximal at a frame rate of 12.5 Hz and smaller for scrambled movies. These results indicate that both the amount of static information and the fluid facial motion per se are important factors for the processing of dynamic faces. ",
pmid_20959510,Dissociable neural systems support retrieval of how and why action knowledge.,,"In everyday discourse, people typically represent actions in one of two ways: how they are performed or why they are performed. In the present study, we determined the neural systems that support these natural modes of representing actions. Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while identifying how and why people perform various familiar actions. Identifying how actions are performed produced activity in premotor areas that support the execution of actions and in higher-order visual areas that support the perception of action-related objects; this finding supports an embodied view of action knowledge. However, identifying why actions are performed preferentially engaged areas of the brain associated with representing and reasoning about mental states; these areas were right temporoparietal junction, precuneus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and posterior superior temporal sulcus. Our results suggest that why action knowledge is not sufficiently constituted by information in motor and visual systems, but requires a system for representing states of mind, which do not have reliable motor correlates or visual appearance.

pmid_21703352,Neural regions associated with self control and mentalizing are recruited during prosocial behaviors towards the family.,,"Prosocial decisions can be difficult because they often involve personal sacrifices that do not generate any direct, immediate benefits to the self. The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to understand how individuals decide to provide support to others. Twenty-five participants were scanned as they completed a task in which they made costly decisions to contribute money to their family and noncostly decisions to accept personal monetary rewards. Decisions to contribute to the family recruited brain regions involved in self-control and mentalizing, especially for individuals with stronger family obligation preferences. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses revealed that individuals with stronger family obligation preferences showed greater functional coupling between regions involved in self-control and mentalizing with the ventral striatum, a region involved in reward processing. These findings suggest that prosocial behavior may require both social cognition and deliberate effort, and the application of these processes may result in greater positive reinforcement during prosocial behavior.

However, the mechanisms governing the nociceptive pathways in the human brain are unclear. The aim of this study was to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) to investigate changes in resting-state brain activity in subjects that experienced experimentally induced low back pain. Healthy subjects (n = 15) underwent fMRI (3.0 T) at baseline and during painful stimulation (intramuscular injection of 3% hypertonic saline). Compared to the scans conducted at baseline, scans conducted during experimentally induced low back pain showed increased ReHo on the right side in the medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus, insula, parahippocampal gyrus and cerebellum (posterior lobe), but decreased ReHo in the primary somatosensory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and parahippocampal gyrus on the left side. The right inferior parietal lobule also showed a decreased ReHo (P < 0.05, cluster threshold ≥10). These findings suggest that abnormally spontaneous resting-state activity in some brain regions may be associated with pain processing. These changes in neural activity may contribute to the recognition, execution, memory and emotional processing of acute low back pain. ",

Trigeminocervical complex","Migraine is a common neurological disease with a high prevalence and unsatisfactory treatment options. The specific pathophysiological mechanisms of migraine remain unclear, which restricts the development of effective treatments for this prevalent disorder. The aims of this study were to 1) compare the spontaneous brain activity differences between Migraine without Aura (MwoA) patients and healthy controls (HCs), using amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) calculation method, and 2) explore how an effective treatment (verum acupuncture) could modulate the ALFF of MwoA patients. One hundred MwoA patients and forty-six matched HCs were recruited. Patients were randomized to four weeks' verum acupuncture, sham acupuncture, and waiting list groups. Patients had resting state BOLD-fMRI scan before and after treatment, while HCs only had resting state BOLD-fMRI scan at baseline. Headache intensity, headache frequency, self-rating anxiety and self-rating depression were used for clinical efficacy evaluation. Compared with HCs, MwoA patients showed increased ALFF in posterior insula and putamen/caudate, and reduced ALFF in rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM)/trigeminocervical complex (TCC). After longitudinal verum acupuncture treatment, the decreased ALFF of the RVM/TCC was normalized in migraine patients. Verum acupuncture and sham acupuncture have different modulation effects on ALFF of RVM/TCC in migraine patients. Our results suggest that impairment of the homeostasis of the trigeminovascular nociceptive pathway is involved in the neural pathophysiology of migraines. Effective treatments, such as verum acupuncture, could help to restore this imbalance. ",
pmid_22290121,Disorder-specific functional abnormalities during sustained attention in youth with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and with autism.,,"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are often comorbid and share behavioural-cognitive abnormalities in sustained attention. A key question is whether this shared cognitive phenotype is based on common or different underlying pathophysiologies. To elucidate this question, we compared 20 boys with ADHD to 20 age and IQ matched ASD and 20 healthy boys using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a parametrically modulated vigilance task with a progressively increasing load of sustained attention. ADHD and ASD boys had significantly reduced activation relative to controls in bilateral striato-thalamic regions, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and superior parietal cortex. Both groups also displayed significantly increased precuneus activation relative to controls. Precuneus was negatively correlated with the DLPFC activation, and progressively more deactivated with increasing attention load in controls, but not patients, suggesting problems with deactivation of a task-related default mode network in both disorders. However, left DLPFC underactivation was significantly more pronounced in ADHD relative to ASD boys, which furthermore was associated with sustained performance measures that were only impaired in ADHD patients. ASD boys, on the other hand, had disorder-specific enhanced cerebellar activation relative to both ADHD and control boys, presumably reflecting compensation. The findings show that ADHD and ASD boys have both shared and disorder-specific abnormalities in brain function during sustained attention. Shared deficits were in fronto-striato-parietal activation and default mode suppression. Differences were a more severe DLPFC dysfunction in ADHD and a disorder-specific fronto-striato-cerebellar dysregulation in ASD. ",
pmid_22009130,Lateralization of amygdala activation in fMRI may depend on phase-encoding polarity.,,"Susceptibility artifacts along the phase-encoding (PE) direction impact the activation pattern in the amygdala and may lead to systematic asymmetries. We implemented a triple-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence, acquiring opposite PE polarities along left-right PE direction in a single shot, to investigate its effects on amygdala lateralization. Twelve subjects viewed emotional faces to evoke amygdala activation. A region of interest analysis revealed that the lateralization of amygdala responses depended on the PE polarity thus representing a pure method artifact. Alternating PE with multi-echo EPI reduced the artifact. Lateralized fMRI activation in areas with magnetic field inhomogeneities need to be interpreted with caution. ",

lateral orbitofrontal cortex","Alcohol misuse is associated with significant energy deficits. As feeding involves multiple sensory, cognitive, and affective processes, low food intake in problem drinkers likely reflects alterations in both regional and inter-regional responses. To investigate the effects of problem drinking on feeding-related neural activities and connectivities, we examined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in 82 drinkers who viewed palatable food and nonfood images in alternating blocks. Drinking severity was assessed with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). A whole-brain multiple regression with AUDIT scores as the predictor showed a negative correlation between drinking severity and activation to food vs nonfood cues in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC). AUDIT scores were also negatively correlated with the gray matter volume (GMV) of the lOFC and regions that responded preferentially to food stimuli, including the left middle frontal gyrus, bilateral middle insula, and occipital cortices. Connectivity strength between the lOFC and these regions was negatively modulated by drinking severity. In contrast, there was no relationship between AUDIT scores and lOFC connectivity with regions that did not show either selectivity to food images or GMV loss. A mediation analysis further suggested that alcohol misuse may have compromised lOFC's structural integrity, which in turn disrupted lOFC interactions with regions that support the processing of visual food cues. Overall, the findings provide evidence for the effects of problem drinking on the brain substrates of feeding, potentially shedding light on the neural mechanisms underlying energy deficits in at-risk drinkers.

pmid_15670683,Dissociating neural correlates for nouns and verbs.,,"Dissociations in the ability to produce words of different grammatical categories are well established in neuropsychology but have not been corroborated fully with evidence from brain imaging. Here we report on a PET study designed to reveal the anatomical correlates of grammatical processes involving nouns and verbs. German-speaking subjects were asked to produce either plural and singular nouns, or first-person plural and singular verbs. Verbs, relative to nouns, activated a left frontal cortical network, while the opposite contrast (nouns-verbs) showed greater activation in temporal regions bilaterally. Similar patterns emerged when subjects performed the task with pseudowords used as nouns or as verbs. These results converge with findings from lesion studies and suggest that grammatical category is an important dimension of organization for knowledge of language in the brain. ",
pmid_23319314,Ventral medial prefrontal functional connectivity and emotion regulation in chronic schizophrenia: a pilot study.,,"People with schizophrenia exhibit impaired social cognitive functions, particularly emotion regulation. Abnormal activations of the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) during emotional tasks have been demonstrated in schizophrenia, suggesting its important role in emotion processing in patients. We used the resting-state functional connectivity approach, setting a functionally relevant region, the vMPFC, as a seed region to examine the intrinsic functional interactions and communication between the vMPFC and other brain regions in schizophrenic patients. We found hypo-connectivity between the vMPFC and the medial frontal cortex, right middle temporal lobe (MTL), right hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and amygdala. Further, there was a decreased strength of the negative connectivity (or anticorrelation) between the vMPFC and the bilateral dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and pre-supplementary motor areas. Among these connectivity alterations, reduced vMPFC-DLPFC connectivity was positively correlated with positive symptoms on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, while vMPFC-right MTL/PHC/amygdala functional connectivity was positively correlated with the performance of emotional regulation in patients. These findings imply that communication and coordination throughout the brain networks are disrupted in schizophrenia. The emotional correlates of vMPFC connectivity suggest a role of the hypo-connectivity between these regions in the neuropathology of abnormal social cognition in chronic schizophrenia. ",

reward anticipation
ventral striatum","Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with decreased ventral-striatal responsiveness during reward anticipation. However, previous research mostly focused on adults with heterogeneous ADHD subtype and divers drug treatment status while studies in children with ADHD are sparse. Moreover, it remains unclear to what degree ADHD is characterized by a delay of normal brain structure or function maturation. We therefore attempt to determine whether results from structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are associated with childhood and adult ADHD combined subtype (ADHD-CT). This study used fMRI to compare VS structure and function of 30 participants with ADHD-CT (16 adults, 14 children) and 30 controls (20 adults, 10 children), using a monetary incentive delay task. Joint analyses of structural and functional imaging data were conducted with Biological Parametric Mapping. Reward anticipation elicited decreased ventral-striatal responsiveness in adults but not in children with ADHD-CT. Children and adults with ADHD showed reduced ventral-striatal volume. Taking these gray matter differences into account, the results remained the same. These results suggest that decreased ventral-striatal responsiveness during reward anticipation is present in adults but not in children with ADHD-CT, irrespective of structural characteristics. The question arises whether ventral-striatal hypoactivity is an ADHD correlate that develops during the course of illness. ",
pmid_18076530,Brain systems underlying response flexibility in healthy and bipolar adolescents: an event-related fMRI study.,,"Previous studies have indicated abnormalities in response flexibility in pediatric bipolar disorder (BD). Dysfunction in response flexibility may contribute to the pattern of behavioral and emotional dysregulation that is characteristic of BD, since depressed and manic patients respond inflexibly to emotional stimuli (i.e., anhedonia in the case of depression or inappropriate positive affect in the case of mania). The present study was undertaken to determine if neuronal responses differed between BD and control subjects on a simple motor response flexibility task. To elucidate the neural substrates mediating response flexibility in pediatric BD, we studied 25 youth with BD and 17 age-, gender- and IQ-matched controls (CON) as they performed the change task while undergoing event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The change task is a new fMRI task that requires subjects to both inhibit and replace a prepotent motor response with another motor response after the initial response has been cued. On correctly performed change trials relative to correctly performed go trials, BD patients generated significantly more activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and in the primary motor cortex than did healthy controls, even though performance levels did not differ across groups. These results indicate that functional deficits within the left DLPFC may mediate deficits in response flexibility in pediatric BD. This deficit may extend beyond the realm of motor control and also affect emotion regulation. ",

pmid_17855612,Orbitofrontal cortex encodes willingness to pay in everyday economic transactions.,,"An essential component of every economic transaction is a willingness-to-pay (WTP) computation in which buyers calculate the maximum amount of financial resources that they are willing to give up in exchange for the object being sold. Despite its pervasiveness, little is known about how the brain makes this computation. We investigated the neural basis of the WTP computation by scanning hungry subjects' brains using functional magnetic resonance imaging while they placed real bids for the right to eat different foods. We found that activity in the medial orbitofrontal cortex and in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex encodes subjects' WTP for the items. Our results support the hypothesis that the medial orbitofrontal cortex encodes the value of goals in decision making. ",
pmid_26182424,A Neurocomputational Model of Altruistic Choice and Its Implications.,,"We propose a neurocomputational model of altruistic choice and test it using behavioral and fMRI data from a task in which subjects make choices between real monetary prizes for themselves and another. We show that a multi-attribute drift-diffusion model, in which choice results from accumulation of a relative value signal that linearly weights payoffs for self and other, captures key patterns of choice, reaction time, and neural response in ventral striatum, temporoparietal junction, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. The model generates several novel insights into the nature of altruism. It explains when and why generous choices are slower or faster than selfish choices, and why they produce greater response in TPJ and vmPFC, without invoking competition between automatic and deliberative processes or reward value for generosity. It also predicts that when one's own payoffs are valued more than others', some generous acts may reflect mistakes rather than genuinely pro-social preferences. ",

As such, whether it (i) down-regulates early affective brain processes or (ii) depends on cognitive control systems remains unclear. We exposed meditation-naïve participants to two kinds of stimuli: negative vs. neutral images and painful vs. warm temperatures. On alternating blocks, we asked participants to either react naturally or exercise mindful acceptance. Emotion regulation using mindful acceptance was associated with reductions in reported pain and negative affect, reduced amygdala responses to negative images and reduced heat-evoked responses in medial and lateral pain systems. Critically, mindful acceptance significantly reduced activity in a distributed, a priori neurologic signature that is sensitive and specific to experimentally induced pain. In addition, these changes occurred in the absence of detectable increases in prefrontal control systems. The findings support the idea that momentary mindful acceptance regulates emotional intensity by changing initial appraisals of the affective significance of stimuli, which has consequences for clinical treatment of pain and emotion.

pmid_25279500,Leptin therapy alters appetite and neural responses to food stimuli in brain areas of leptin-sensitive subjects without altering brain structure.,,"Leptin is a key regulator of energy intake and expenditure. Individuals with congenital leptin deficiency demonstrate structural and functional brain changes when given leptin. However, whether acquired leptin deficiency may operate similarly is unclear. We set out to determine whether the brains of individuals with acquired leptin deficiency may react to leptin in a similar manner. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging before and after short- and long-term metreleptin treatment in three leptin-sensitive patients with acquired hypoleptinemia. Nine healthy women were scanned as normoleptinemic controls. The setting was an academic medical center. The participants were 3 hypoleptinemic women and nine normoleptinemic, matched women. We used metreleptin, recombinant leptin, therapy for 24 weeks in hypoleptinemic women only. We measured neural changes in response to viewing food as compared to nonfood images. We hypothesized that metreleptin treatment would increase brain activity in areas related to cognitive control and inhibition and would decrease brain activity in areas related to reward processing, as compared to the normoleptinemic counterparts. Unlike patients with congenital leptin deficiency, hypoleptinemic patients demonstrated no structural brain differences from healthy controls and/or structural changes in response to treatment. Short-term metreleptin treatment in leptin-sensitive hypoleptinemic subjects enhances areas involved in detecting the salience and rewarding value of food during fasting, whereas long-term treatment decreases attention to food and the rewarding value of food after feeding. Furthermore, hypothalamic activity is modulated by metreleptin treatment, and leptin decreases functional connectivity of the hypothalamus to key feeding-related areas in these hypoleptinemic subjects. Leptin replacement in acutely hypoleptinemic women did not alter brain structure but did alter functional cortical activity to food cues in key feeding and reward-related areas. ",

The participants were 36 children and adolescents (ages 10-17 years); 17 had DBD + PT and 19 were healthy comparison subjects. Participants performed a spatial attention paradigm where spatial attention was cued by eye gaze in faces displaying fearful, angry, or neutral affect. Eye gaze sensitivity was indexed both behaviorally and as BOLD response. There were no group differences in behavioral response: both groups showed significantly faster responses if the target was in the congruent spatial direction indicated by eye gaze. Neither group showed a Congruence × Emotion interaction; neither group showed an advantage from the displayer's emotional expression behaviorally. However, the BOLD response revealed a significant Group × Congruence × Emotion interaction. The comparison youth showed increased activity within the dorsal endogenous orienting network (superior parietal lobule and inferior parietal sulcus) for fearful congruent relative to incongruent trials relative to the youth with DBD + PT. The results are discussed with reference to current models of DBD + PT and possible treatment innovations. ",

The aim of this study was to examine local and global brain volume differences between typically developing children (TD) and children with a diagnosis of ADHD. We also addressed whether these parameters would differ between children with the ADHD-combined type (ADHD-C) and those with the ADHD-inattentive type (ADHD-I). Using an ROI approach caudate volume differences were also examined. 79 boys between the ages of 8 and 17 participated in the study. Of those 33 met diagnostic criteria for the ADHD-C and 15 for the ADHD-I subtype. 31 boys were included in the TD group. Structural magnetic resonance imaging data were analysed using voxel-based morphometry. The ADHD group had significantly lower global and local grey matter volumes within clusters in the bilateral frontal, right parietal and right temporal regions compared to TD. A significant group by age interaction was found for right caudate nucleus volume. No differences between the ADHD-C and ADHD-I groups were found. Right caudate nucleus volume and age are more strongly related in ADHD than in TD consistent with previous research. ",

Resting-state functional connectivity
Somatic symptom","Depressive patients frequently present with somatic complaints such as pain and fatigue. The anterior insula (AI) is a crucial region for somatic processing, but reported contributions of AI dysfunction to somatic symptoms have varied across studies. We speculated that functional heterogeneity among AI subdivisions may contribute to this inconsistency. To reveal the correlation between each subdivision and somatic symptoms, we investigated resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) based on seeds within distinct AI subdivisions in 45 depressive patients and 35 matched healthy controls (HCs). Depressive and somatic symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the 15-item somatic symptom severity scale of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15), respectively. The contributions of AI subregion-specific pathways to depression were further validated by examining changes in symptom severity and RSFC following electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). At baseline, depressive patients exhibited weaker RSFC between ventral AI (vAI) and right orbitofrontal cortex (rOFC) than HCs. Moreover, vAI-rOFC RSFC strength was negatively correlated with PHQ-15 and HDRS scores, indicating that weaker RSFC predicted greater symptom severity. ECT reduced depressive and somatic symptoms, and symptom mitigation was correlated with enhanced vAI-rOFC RSFC. The findings suggest that reduced vAI-rOFC RSFC underlies the somatic symptoms of depression and that enhancing vAI-rOFC RSFC can contribute to amelioration of somatic symptoms. ",
pmid_18588986,Proactive inhibitory control of movement assessed by event-related fMRI.,,"Many neuronal processes play a role in the overall performance of inhibition tasks, often making it difficult to associate particular behavioral results to specific processes and structures. Indeed, in classical Go/NoGo, Stop or subliminal masked-prime tasks, inhibition is usually triggered at the same time as the sensorimotor processes involved in movement selection and conflict monitoring. To account for motor inhibition, many conflicting candidate structures, which depend on specific task requirements, have been proposed. In the present paper, first we used a simple reaction (RT) time task and, second, we took advantage of the fact that volitional inhibition is usually implemented before any stimulus occurs when subjects are aware that a warning signal will be presented before a target. This proactive inhibition would be intended to prevent anticipated responses and would be lifted as soon as the warning signal has been identified. In other words, we postulate that the same event does not trigger both inhibition and target processing, and that, indeed, these mechanisms can be separated in time. Event-related fMRI revealed that the medial prefrontal cortex and the inferior parietal cortex may be responsible for proactive inhibition, and that the primary motor cortex, the supplementary motor cortex and the putamen are the likely targeted sites of this inhibition. We conclude that executive control in these tasks may consist of switching from controlled inhibition (suppression of the neuronal processes underlying movement initiation) to automatic sensorimotor processing. The possible contribution of the medial prefrontal cortex to the tonic inhibition state adds new perspectives to possible meanings of a ""default mode of brain function"". ",
pmid_17301186,Neural activity is modulated by trial history: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study of the effects of a previous antisaccade.,,"Saccadic latencies are influenced by what occurred during the previous trial. When the previous trial is an antisaccade, the latencies of both prosaccades and antisaccades are prolonged. The aim of this study was to identify neural correlates of this intertrial effect of antisaccades. Specifically, based on both monkey electrophysiology and human neuroimaging findings, we expected trials preceded by antisaccades to be associated with reduced frontal eye field (FEF) activity relative to those preceded by prosaccades. Twenty-one healthy participants performed pseudorandom sequences of prosaccade and antisaccade trials during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with concurrent monitoring of eye position. We compared activity in trials preceded by an antisaccade with activity in trials preceded by a prosaccade. The primary result was that a previous antisaccade prolonged saccadic latency and reduced fMRI activity in the FEF and other regions. No regions showed increased activity. We interpret the reduced FEF activity and slower saccadic responses to reflect inhibitory influences on the response system as a consequence of performing an antisaccade in the previous trial. This demonstrates that neural activity is modulated by trial history, consistent with a rapid, dynamic form of learning. More generally, these results highlight the importance of trial history as a source of variability in both behavioral and neuroimaging studies. ",

Individual differences in decision-making abilities and their underlying neurocircuitry may, therefore, constitute an important predictor for the course of substance use and the development of substance use disorders. Here, we investigate the predictive value of decision making and neural mechanisms underlying decision making for future cannabis use and problem severity in a sample of heavy cannabis users. Brain activity during a monetary decision-making task (Iowa gambling task) was compared between 32 heavy cannabis users and 41 matched non-using controls using functional magnetic resonance imaging. In addition, within the group of heavy cannabis users, associations were examined between task-related brain activations, cannabis use and cannabis use-related problems at baseline, and change in cannabis use and problem severity after a 6-month follow-up. Despite normal task performance, heavy cannabis users compared with controls showed higher activation during wins in core areas associated with decision making. Moreover, within the group of heavy cannabis users, win-related activity and activity anticipating loss outcomes in areas generally involved in executive functions predicted change in cannabis use after 6 months. These findings are consistent with previous studies and point to abnormal processing of motivational information in heavy cannabis users. A new finding is that individuals who are biased toward immediate rewards have a higher probability of increasing drug use, highlighting the importance of the relative balance between motivational processes and regulatory executive processes in the development of substance use disorders.

pmid_21985908,Influence of estradiol on functional brain organization for working memory.,,"Working memory is a cognitive function that is affected by aging and disease. To better understand the neural substrates for working memory, the present study examined the influence of estradiol on working memory using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Pre-menopausal women were tested on a verbal n-back task during the early (EF) and late follicular (LF) phases of the menstrual cycle. Although brain activation patterns were similar across the two phases, the most striking pattern that emerged was that estradiol had different associations with the two hemispheres. Increased activation in left frontal circuitry in the LF phase was associated with increased estradiol levels and decrements in working memory performance. In contrast, increased activation in right hemisphere regions in the LF phase was associated with improved task performance. The present study showed that better performance in the LF than the EF phase was associated with a pattern of reduced recruitment of the left-hemisphere and increased recruitment of the right-hemisphere in the LF compared to EF phase. We speculate that estradiol interferes with left-hemisphere working-memory processing in the LF phase, but that recruitment of the right hemisphere can compensate for left-hemisphere interference. This may be related to the proposal that estradiol can reduce cerebral asymmetries by modulating transcallosal communication (Hausmann, 2005). ",

This study included 34 cirrhosis patients (17 with DM, 17 without DM) and 17 age-, sex-matched healthy controls. MRI examination and neuropsychological tests were performed. Fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) and voxel-based morphometry algorithms were used to obtain fALFF values and gray matter volume, which were compared and correlated with clinical variables. In cirrhosis patients with and without DM, fALFF values were decreased in the left postcentral gyrus, right precentral gyrus, left supramarginal gyrus, bilateral lingual gyri and occipital lobe, while increased in the left orbital frontal gyrus. Gray matter volume was decreased in bilateral caudates and putamen, while increased in bilateral thalami. Compared with non-DM cirrhosis patients, DM cirrhosis patients showed decreased fALFF values in bilateral caudates and decreased gray matter volume in bilateral thalami. The blood glucose levels of cirrhosis patients showed negative correlations with fALFF values in bilateral caudates and gray matter volume in bilateral thalami. In conclusion, DM aggravates brain damage in cirrhosis patients. Thus, it is important to pay more attention to the management of DM in cirrhotic patients. ",

The aim of this study is to compare the trait impulsivity of those suffering from Internet addiction with that of individuals suffering from pathological gambling. Twenty-seven patients diagnosed with Internet addiction (age: 24.78±4.37 years), 27 patients diagnosed with pathological gambling (age: 25.67±3.97 years), and 27 healthy controls (age: 25.33±2.79 years) were enrolled in this study. All patients were men seeking treatment. Trait impulsivity and the severity of the Internet addiction and pathological gambling were measured by the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11, the Young's Internet Addiction Test, and the South Oaks Gambling Screen, respectively. The Beck Depression Inventory and the Beck Anxiety Inventory were also administered to all subjects. Our results show that those suffering from Internet addiction showed increased levels of trait impulsivity which were comparable to those of patients diagnosed with pathological gambling. Additionally, the severity of Internet addiction was positively correlated with the level of trait impulsivity in patients with Internet addiction. These results state that Internet addiction can be conceptualized as an impulse control disorder and that trait impulsivity is a marker for vulnerability to Internet addiction. ",
pmid_11564318,Functional anatomical correlates of controlled and automatic processing.,,"Behavioral studies have shown that consistent practice of a cognitive task can increase the speed of performance and reduce variability of responses and error rate, reflecting a shift from controlled to automatic processing. This study examines how the shift from controlled to automatic processing changes brain activity. A verbal Sternberg task was used with continuously changing targets (novel task, NT) and with constant, practiced targets (practiced task, PT). NT and PT were presented in a blocked design and contrasted to a choice reaction time (RT) control task (CT) to isolate working memory (WM)-related activity. The three-dimensional (3-D) PRESTO functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sequence was used to measure hemodynamic responses. Behavioral data revealed that task processing became automated after practice, as responses were faster, less variable, and more accurate. This was accompanied specifically by a decrease in activation in regions related to WM (bilateral but predominantly left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), right superior frontal cortex (SFC), and right frontopolar area) and the supplementary motor area. Results showed no evidence for a shift of foci of activity within or across regions of the brain. The findings have theoretical implications for understanding the functional anatomical substrates of automatic and controlled processing, indicating that these types of information processing have the same functional anatomical substrate, but differ in efficiency. In addition, there are practical implications for interpreting activity as a measure for task performance, such as in patient studies. Whereas reduced activity can reflect poor performance if a task is not sensitive to practice effects, it can reflect good performance if a task is sensitive to practice effects. ",
pmid_26285212,Facial Emotion Recognition in Parkinson's Disease: An fMRI Investigation.,,"Findings of behavioral studies on facial emotion recognition in Parkinson's disease (PD) are very heterogeneous. Therefore, the present investigation additionally used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in order to compare brain activation during emotion perception between PD patients and healthy controls. We included 17 nonmedicated, nondemented PD patients suffering from mild to moderate symptoms and 22 healthy controls. The participants were shown pictures of facial expressions depicting disgust, fear, sadness, and anger and they answered scales for the assessment of affective traits. The patients did not report lowered intensities for the displayed target emotions, and showed a comparable rating accuracy as the control participants. The questionnaire scores did not differ between patients and controls. The fMRI data showed similar activation in both groups except for a generally stronger recruitment of somatosensory regions in the patients. Since somatosensory cortices are involved in the simulation of an observed emotion, which constitutes an important mechanism for emotion recognition, future studies should focus on activation changes within this region during the course of disease.

pmid_15831760,Representation of visual gravitational motion in the human vestibular cortex.,,"How do we perceive the visual motion of objects that are accelerated by gravity? We propose that, because vision is poorly sensitive to accelerations, an internal model that calculates the effects of gravity is derived from graviceptive information, is stored in the vestibular cortex, and is activated by visual motion that appears to be coherent with natural gravity. The acceleration of visual targets was manipulated while brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging. In agreement with the internal model hypothesis, we found that the vestibular network was selectively engaged when acceleration was consistent with natural gravity. These findings demonstrate that predictive mechanisms of physical laws of motion are represented in the human brain. ",

In the present study, healthy participants were shown pictures of foods to determine the impact of caloric content on food choice. Brain activity was then measured while participants bid for a chance to purchase and eat one item. True caloric density, but not individual estimates of calorie content, predicted how much participants were willing to pay for each item. Caloric density also correlated with the neural response to food pictures in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a brain area that encodes the value of stimuli and predicts immediate consumption. That same region exhibited functional connectivity with an appetitive brain network, and this connectivity was modulated by willingness to pay. Despite the fact that participants were poor at explicitly judging caloric content, their willingness to pay and brain activity both correlated with actual caloric density. This suggests that the reward value of a familiar food is dependent on implicit knowledge of its caloric content. ",

In this study, normal subjects were repeatedly presented faces of their colleagues, and the effect of repetition on the regional cerebral blood flow change was measured using positron emission tomography. They repeated a set of three tasks: the familiar-face detection (F) task, the facial direction discrimination (D) task, and the perceptual control (C) task. During five repetitions of the F task, familiar faces were presented six times from different views in a pseudorandom order. Activation reduction through the repetition of the F tasks was observed in the bilateral anterior (anterolateral to the polar region) temporal cortices which are suggested to be involved in the access to the long-term memory concerning people. The bilateral amygdala, the hypothalamus, and the medial frontal cortices, were constantly activated during the F tasks, and considered to be associated with the behavioral significance of the presented familiar faces. Constant activation was also observed in the bilateral occipitotemporal regions and fusiform gyri and the right medial temporal regions during perception of the faces, and in the left medial temporal regions during the facial familiarity detection task, which are consistent with the results of previous functional brain imaging studies. The results have provided further information about the functional segregation of the anterior temporal regions in face recognition and long-term memory. ",

Acupuncture has gained popularity and has been accepted gradually by many countries because it can successfully treat patients with chronic pain, but the specific brain mechanisms under acupuncture treatment for CSP remain unclear. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to 1) compare the clinical effects between acupuncture at the contralateral and ipsilateral Tiaokou (ST 38) point in patients with unilateral shoulder pain and 2) explore how contralateral- and ipsilateral-acupuncture modulates the regional homogeneity (ReHo) of patients with CSP. This was a pilot functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) trial. Twenty-four patients with CSP were recruited and randomized to the contralateral acupuncture group (contra-group) and the ipsilateral acupuncture group (ipsi-group). All patients completed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans before and after acupuncture treatment. Shoulder pain intensity (visual analog scale [VAS]) and shoulder joint function (Constant-Murley score [CMS]) were used to evaluate clinical efficiency of treatment. ReHo was used to assess resting-state brain activity. We found clinical improvement in decreasing pain intensity and increasing shoulder function in both groups, and the mean objective shoulder functional improvement in contra-group was better than that in ipsi-group ( Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) may play a direct role in the regulation of brain by the contralateral acupuncture at ST 38 in patients with shoulder pain. On the contrary, the pathway of brainstem-thalamus-cortex may be likely to work in mechanism of acupuncture at ipsilateral ST 38. Our results indicate that the clinical effects and brain mechanisms are different between the stimulation given at contralateral and ipsilateral acupoints in patients with CSP and imply that the selection of either contralateral or ipsilateral acupuncture therapy to treat some chronic pain conditions is necessary.

All groups performed similarly on the task and similarly engaged the inferior frontal gyrus and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, regions traditionally associated with response inhibition and error monitoring, respectively. During response inhibition (i.e., Correct Rejects>Hits contrast), overall group differences emerged in the recruitment of the cerebellum, while individual group differences in error monitoring (False Alarms>Hits contrast) were seen for regions of the parietal lobe and thalamus (current smokers>former smokers), as well as regions of the bilateral cerebellum, parahippocampal gyrus and superior parietal lobe (i.e., ever smokers>never smokers). We discuss how our results replicate two previous large-sample studies that used the same Go/No-Go task and review these data in terms of network models of inhibitory and error monitoring abnormalities in addiction.

The 9-item fatigue severity scale (FSS) was used for fatigue screening and severity rating. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) data were obtained from all subjects. Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) was used to measure regional brain activity, and functional connectivity (FC) was applied to investigate functional connectivity at a network level. PD-related fatigue was associated with ALFF changes in right middle frontal gyrus within the attention network and in left insula as well as right midcingulate cortex within the salience network. FC analysis revealed that above three regions showing ALFF differences had altered functional connectivity mainly in the temporal, parietal, and motor cortices. Our findings do reveal that abnormal regional brain activity within attention and salience network and altered FC of above abnormal regions are involved in neural mechanism of fatigue in patients with PD.

Voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity
fMRI","Migraine is a common headache disorder. Many studies have used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to explore the possible pathogenesis of migraine, but they have not reached consistent conclusions and lack rigorous multiple comparison correction. Thus, this study investigates the mechanisms of migraine development from the perspective of altered functional connectivity (FC) in brain regions by using data-driven and regions of interest (ROI)-based approaches. Resting-state functional MRI data were collected from 30 patients with migraine and 40 healthy controls (HCs) matched for age, gender, and years of education. For the data-driven method, we used a voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) approach to compare the FC between the patients and HCs. For the ROI-based method, significant differences in VMHC maps between the patients and HCs were defined as ROI. The seed-based approach further revealed significant differences in FC between the seeds and the other brain regions. Furthermore, the correlations between abnormal FC and clinical characteristics of patients were investigated. A rigorous multiple comparison correction was used with false discovery rate and permutation test (5000 times). In comparison with the controls group, patients showed enhanced VMHC in the bilateral thalamus. We also observed enhanced FC between the left thalamus and the left superior frontal gyrus, and increased FC between the right thalamus and the left middle frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 45 and Brodmann area 8) in patients. Further analysis showed that the FC values in the left superior frontal gyrus and left middle frontal gyrus were negatively corrected with visual analogue scale scores or attack times for headaches. Patients with migraine showed altered VMHC in the bilateral thalamus, and abnormal FC of bilateral thalamus and other brain regions. The abnormalities in thalamic FC are a likely mechanism for the development of migraine. Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR2000033995. Registered on 20 June 2020. ",
pmid_19926457,Neural correlates of response inhibition in pediatric bipolar disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.,,"Impulsivity, inattention and poor behavioral inhibition are common deficits in pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This study aimed to identify similarities and differences in the neural substrate of response inhibition deficits that are associated with these disorders. A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was conducted on 15 unmedicated PBD patients (Type I, manic/mixed), 11 unmedicated ADHD patients, and 15 healthy controls (HC) (mean age = 13.5 years; S.D. = 3.5). A response inhibition task examined the ability to inhibit a motor response to a target when a stop cue appeared shortly after. The PBD and ADHD groups did not differ on behavioral performance, although both groups were less accurate than the HC group. fMRI findings showed that for trials requiring response inhibition, the ADHD group, relative to the PBD and HC groups, demonstrated reduced activation in both ventrolateral (VLPFC) and dorsolateral (DLPFC) prefrontal cortex, and increased bilateral caudate activation compared with HC. The PBD group, relative to HC, showed decreased activation in the left VLPFC, at the junction of the inferior and middle frontal gyri, and in the right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Prefrontal dysfunction was observed in both the ADHD and PBD groups relative to HC, although it was more extensive and accompanied by subcortical overactivity in ADHD. ",

intrinsic connectivity distribution
resting-state fMRI","Alterations in brain connectivity have been implicated in internet gaming disorder (IGD). However, little is known about alterations in whole-brain connectivity and their associations with long-term treatment outcomes. Here, we used a relatively new analytic approach, intrinsic connectivity distribution (ICD) analysis, to examine brain connectivity in 74 IGD participants and 41 matched healthy controls (HCs) and conducted post hoc seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analyses based on the ICD findings. We also examined how these findings related to outcomes involving a craving behavioral intervention (CBI) for IGD. IGD participants showed less whole-brain connectivity in the left angular gyrus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) compared with HC participants. Seed-based rsFC analyses revealed that the left angular gyrus in the IGD group showed less connectivity with areas involved in the default-mode network and greater connectivity with areas in the salience and executive control networks. CBI was associated with improved connectivity within regions in the default-mode network and regions across the default-mode and salience networks. ICD-identified connectivity differences in the left angular gyrus and vmPFC were related to changes in craving and severity of addiction 6 months after the intervention. The findings suggest that IGD is associated with alterations in brain connectivity that may be sensitive to interventions. Thus, the findings have implications for understanding mechanisms underlying CBI effects and for further treatment development. ",

We utilized a structural covariance network (SCN) mapping approach to investigate large-scale networks in 30 drug-naïve ADHD boys and 30 gender- and age-matched controls. The regions showing significant between-group differences in gray matter (GM) volume were defined as seed regions of interest. Then, the SCNs derived from these seeds were statistically compared between ADHD and controls. Significant regional GM volume decreases (P<0.05, corrected) were observed in the right insula and the right orbito-frontal cortex (OFC) in ADHD relative to controls. Both SCNs derived from these two seeds showed more localized topology in ADHD group. Furthermore, significantly decreased structural connectivity were found between insula and right hippocampus, bilateral olfactory cortex, and between OFC and bilateral caudate nucleus (P<0.05, corrected) in ADHD group. Significantly increased association was observed between insula and left middle temporal gyrus (P<0.05, corrected) in ADHD group. Taken together, our results reveal abnormal regional brain anatomy as well as aberrant structural covariance networks in ADHD, supporting previous findings of dysfunction in distributed network organization in patients with ADHD.

pmid_17888411,The neural bases of emotion regulation: reappraisal and suppression of negative emotion.,,"Emotion regulation strategies are thought to differ in when and how they influence the emotion-generative process. However, no study to date has directly probed the neural bases of two contrasting (e.g., cognitive versus behavioral) emotion regulation strategies. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine cognitive reappraisal (a cognitive strategy thought to have its impact early in the emotion-generative process) and expressive suppression (a behavioral strategy thought to have its impact later in the emotion-generative process). Seventeen women viewed 15 sec neutral and negative emotion-eliciting films under four conditions--watch-neutral, watch-negative, reappraise-negative, and suppress-negative--while providing emotion experience ratings and having their facial expressions videotaped. Reappraisal resulted in early (0-4.5 sec) prefrontal cortex (PFC) responses, decreased negative emotion experience, and decreased amygdala and insular responses. Suppression produced late (10.5-15 sec) PFC responses, decreased negative emotion behavior and experience, but increased amygdala and insular responses. These findings demonstrate the differential efficacy of reappraisal and suppression on emotional experience, facial behavior, and neural response and highlight intriguing differences in the temporal dynamics of these two emotion regulation strategies.

pmid_8624677,Is developmental dyslexia a disconnection syndrome? Evidence from PET scanning.,,"A rhyming and short-term memory task with visually presented letters were used to study brain activity in five compensated adult developmental dyslexics. Their only cognitive difficulty was in phonological processing, manifest in a wide range of tasks including spoonerisms, phonemic fluency and digit naming speed. PET scans showed that for the dyslexics, a subset only of the brain regions normally involved in phonological processing was activated: Broca's area during the rhyming task, temporo-parietal cortex during the short- term memory task. In contrast to normal controls these areas were not activated in concert. Furthermore the left insula was never activated. We propose that the defective phonological system of these dyslexics is due to weak connectivity between anterior and posterior language areas. This could be due to a dysfunctional left insula which may normally act as an anatomical bridge between Broca's area, superior temporal and inferior parietal cortex. The independent activation of the posterior and anterior speech areas in dyslexics supports the notion that representations of unsegmented and segmented phonology are functionally and anatomically separate.

pmid_18640909,Review. The neurobiology of pathological gambling and drug addiction: an overview and new findings.,,"Gambling is a prevalent recreational behaviour. Approximately 5% of adults have been estimated to experience problems with gambling. The most severe form of gambling, pathological gambling (PG), is recognized as a mental health condition. Two alternate non-mutually exclusive conceptualizations of PG have considered it as an obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder and a 'behavioural' addiction. The most appropriate conceptualization of PG has important theoretical and practical implications. Data suggest a closer relationship between PG and substance use disorders than exists between PG and obsessive-compulsive disorder. This paper will review data on the neurobiology of PG, consider its conceptualization as a behavioural addiction, discuss impulsivity as an underlying construct, and present new brain imaging findings investigating the neural correlates of craving states in PG as compared to those in cocaine dependence. Implications for prevention and treatment strategies will be discussed. ",

Mindfulness involves practice in volitional shifting of attention from ""mind wandering"" to present-moment attention to sensations, and cultivating acceptance. We examined potential neural correlates of mindfulness training using a novel group therapy (mindfulness-based exposure therapy (MBET)) in combat veterans with PTSD deployed to Afghanistan (OEF) and/or Iraq (OIF). Twenty-three male OEF/OIF combat veterans with PTSD were treated with a mindfulness-based intervention (N = 14) or an active control group therapy (present-centered group therapy (PCGT), N = 9). Pre-post therapy functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI, 3 T) examined resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in default mode network (DMN) using posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) seeds, and salience network (SN) with anatomical amygdala seeds. PTSD symptoms were assessed at pre- and posttherapy with Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). Patients treated with MBET had reduced PTSD symptoms (effect size d = 0.92) but effect was not significantly different from PCGT (d = 0.46). Increased DMN rsFC (PCC seed) with dorsolateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) regions and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) regions associated with executive control was seen following MBET. A group × time interaction found MBET showed increased connectivity with DLPFC and dorsal ACC following therapy; PCC-DLPFC connectivity was correlated with improvement in PTSD avoidant and hyperarousal symptoms. Increased connectivity between DMN and executive control regions following mindfulness training could underlie increased capacity for volitional shifting of attention. The increased PCC-DLPFC rsFC following MBET was related to PTSD symptom improvement, pointing to a potential therapeutic mechanism of mindfulness-based therapies. ",

voxel-based morphometry","Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is a clinical subtype of MCI, which is known to have a high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although neuroimaging studies have reported brain abnormalities in patients with aMCI, concurrent structural and functional patterns in patients with aMCI were still unclear. In this study, we combined voxel-based morphometry (VBM), amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFFs), regional homogeneity (Reho), and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) approaches to explore concurrent structural and functional alterations in patients with aMCI. We found that, compared with healthy controls (HCs), both ALFF and Reho were decreased in the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG_R) and right middle frontal gyrus (MFG_R) of patients with aMCI, and both gray matter volume (GMV) and Reho were decreased in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG_L) of patients with aMCI. Furthermore, we took these overlapping clusters from VBM, ALFF, and Reho analyses as seed regions to analyze RSFC. We found that, compared with HCs, patients with aMCI had decreased RSFC between SFG_R and the right temporal lobe (subgyral) (TL_R), the MFG_R seed and left superior temporal gyrus (STG_L), left inferior parietal lobule (IPL_L), and right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC_R), the IFG_L seed and left precentral gyrus (PRG_L), left cingulate gyrus (CG_L), and IPL_L. These findings highlighted shared imaging features in structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), suggesting that SFG_R, MFG_R, and IFG_L may play a major role in the pathophysiology of aMCI, which might be useful to better understand the underlying neural mechanisms of aMCI and AD.

pmid_19347874,Attachment avoidance modulates neural response to masked facial emotion.,,"According to recent models of individual differences in attachment organization, a basic dimension of adult attachment is avoidance. Attachment-related avoidance corresponds to tendencies to withdraw from close relationships and to an unwillingness to rely on others. In the formation of attachment orientation during infancy facial emotional interaction plays a central role. There exists an inborn very rapid decoding capacity for facial emotional expression. In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine differences in automatic brain reactivity to facial emotions as a function of attachment avoidance in a sample of 51 healthy adults. Pictures of sad and happy faces (which are approach-related interpersonal signals) were presented masked by neutral faces. The Relationship Scales Questionnaire (RSQ) was used to assess the attachment avoidance. Masked sad faces activated the amygdala, the insula, occipito-temporal areas, and the somatosensory cortices. Independently from trait anxiety, depressivity, and detection performance, attachment avoidance was found to be inversely related to responses of the primary somatosensory cortex (BA 3) to masked sad faces. A low spontaneous responsivity of the primary somatosensory cortex to negative faces could be a correlate of the habitual unwillingness to deal with partners' distress and needs for proximity. The somatosensory cortices are known to be critically involved in the processes of emotional mimicry and simulation which have the potential to increase social affiliation. Our data are consistent with the idea that people who withdraw from close relationships respond spontaneously to a lesser extent to negative interpersonal emotional signals than securely attached individuals.

pmid_14568451,Time-dependent neural activations related to recognition of people's names in emotional and neutral face-name associative learning: an fMRI study.,,"Previous data have indicated that the left anterior temporal lobe contributes to the retrieval of familiar people's names, and that the extended network including the bilateral anterior temporal lobe plays an important role in the retrieval of newly learned people's names. However, there has been no direct evidence for time-dependent change in brain activation in face-name associations. In addition, previous studies have demonstrated that emotional information such as emotional faces may contribute to the organization of long-lasting episodic memory. In the present study, we investigated the activations related to the recognition of people's names in the context of emotional and neutral face-name associative learning. Before fMRI scanning, subjects learned face-name associations that included emotionally positive and neutral facial expressions. In immediate (5 min later) and delayed (2 weeks later) recognition with fMRI scanning, subjects were presented with studied faces with two names, and were asked to choose the correct associative name learned previously. Recognition-related activations were identified in the anterior part of bilateral temporal lobe for immediate recognition and only in the left temporal lobe for delayed recognition. Further analysis confirmed the time-dependent change in activation of the right anterior temporal lobe. Activation related to the processing of faces with positive expressions were observed in the left periamygdaloid area and temporal pole, although emotional information did not have an influence on task performance in this study. These findings suggest that the neural network involving the bilateral temporal lobe contributes to the retrieval of newly learned people's names, and that the left temporal lobe has a crucial and stable role in retrieval of people's names from faces, whereas the role of the right temporal lobe in retrieval of people's names may decrease with the time course.

pmid_18448453,Enhanced processing of threat stimuli under limited attentional resources.,,"The ability to process stimuli that convey potential threat, under conditions of limited attentional resources, confers adaptive advantages. This study examined the neurobiology underpinnings of this capacity. Employing an attentional blink paradigm, in conjunction with functional magnetic resonance imaging, we manipulated the salience of the second of 2 face target stimuli (T2), by varying emotionality. Behaviorally, fearful T2 faces were identified significantly more than neutral faces. Activity in fusiform face area increased with correct identification of T2 faces. Enhanced activity in rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) accounted for the benefit in detection of fearful stimuli reflected in a significant interaction between target valence and correct identification. Thus, under conditions of limited attention resources activation in rACC correlated with enhanced processing of emotional stimuli. We suggest that these data support a model in which a prefrontal ""gate"" mechanism controls conscious access of emotional information under conditions of limited attentional resources. ",
pmid_31882652,Effects of Acute Aerobic Exercise on Response Inhibition in Adult Patients with ADHD.,,"Previous studies suggest beneficial effects of aerobic exercise on executive functions, which are a core deficit in ADHD. The aim of the present fMRI study was to investigate acute effects of aerobic exercise on inhibitory control and related brain activation in adult patients with ADHD. 23 patients and 23 matched healthy controls performed on a Go/No-go task in an MRI scanner, following both, an exercise condition involving 30 min of cycling at moderate intensity, and a control condition. ADHD patients compared to healthy controls showed increased brain activation during successful inhibition in the exercise compared to the control condition in parietal, temporal, and occipital regions. Exercise did not improve behavioral performance in either group, but in ADHD patients, exercise-related increases in brain activation and behavioral task performance (i.e., correct inhibition rate) negatively correlated with correct inhibition rate in the control condition. Thus, patients with worse inhibition performance showed stronger exercise-related enhancements, indicating that the lack of improvements on the behavioral level for the whole patient group could be due to ceiling effects. Our findings might be an important step in understanding the neural basis of exercise effects and could, in the long term, help in developing alternative treatment approaches for ADHD. ",

Some vulnerable structures are related to the central autonomic network and have also been linked to autonomic function alterations. The aims of the study are to evaluate the severity of the autonomic dysfunction and the cortical hypoperfusion using arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI. And then, possible relationships of significant between-group differences in perfusion pattern to clinical variables and autonomic functions were examined to determine the pharmaceutical effects of dopaminergic treatment on cerebral blood flow (CBF) in patients with PD. Brain ASL MRI was carried out in 20 patients with PD (6 men and 14 women, mean age: 63.3 ± 6.4 years) and 22 sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers to assess whole-brain CBF and the effects of dopaminergic therapy on perfusion. All subjects underwent a standardized evaluation of cardiovagal and adrenergic function including a deep breathing, Valsalva maneuver, and 5-min head-up tilt test. Perfusion MRI data were acquired on a 3.0 T scanner with a pulsed continuous ASL technique. The CBF, autonomic parameters, and clinical data were analyzed after adjusting for age and sex. Patients exhibited a decline in autonomic function (rapid heart rate in response to deep breathing, low baroreflex sensitivity, high systolic and diastolic pressure, and altered tilting test response), widespread low CBF, and robust response to dopaminergic therapy. Lower perfusion in the middle frontal gyrus was associated with increased clinical disease severity (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale I score,  Our study indicates that PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that changes the perfusion of central nervous system and is associated with variable autonomic dysfunctions. Neuronal loss and sympathetic activation may explain the interaction between cortical autonomic region perfusion and cardiovascular autonomic function. ",
pmid_15146191,Selective neural representation of objects relevant for navigation.,,"As people find their way through their environment, objects at navigationally relevant locations can serve as crucial landmarks. The parahippocampal gyrus has previously been shown to be involved in object and scene recognition. In the present study, we investigated the neural representation of navigationally relevant locations. Healthy human adults viewed a route through a virtual museum with objects placed at intersections (decision points) or at simple turns (non-decision points). Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired during subsequent recognition of the objects in isolation. Neural activity in the parahippocampal gyrus reflected the navigational relevance of an object's location in the museum. Parahippocampal responses were selectively increased for objects that occurred at decision points, independent of attentional demands. This increase occurred for forgotten as well as remembered objects, showing implicit retrieval of navigational information. The automatic storage of relevant object location in the parahippocampal gyrus provides a part of the neural mechanism underlying successful navigation. ",

This fMRI study aimed to index the neural correlates of food reward in a subsample of individuals with restrictive AN: twelve currently ill, fourteen recovered individuals and sixteen healthy controls. Participants were shown pictures of high and low-calorie foods and asked to evaluate how much they wanted to eat each one following a four hour fast. Whole-brain task-activated analysis was followed by psychophysiological interaction analysis (PPI) of the amygdala and caudate. In the AN group, we observed a differential pattern of activation in the lateral frontal pole: increasing following presentation of high-calorie stimuli and decreasing in during presentation of low-calorie food pictures, the opposite of which was seen in the healthy control (HC) group. In addition, decreased activation to food pictures was observed in somatosensory regions in the AN group. PPI analyses suggested hypo-connectivity in reward pathways, and between the caudate and both somatosensory and visual processing regions in the AN group. No significant between-group differences were observed between the recovered group and the currently ill and healthy controls in the PPI analysis. Taken together, these findings further our understanding of the neural processes which may underpin the avoidance of high-calorie foods in those with AN and might exacerbate the development of compulsive weight-loss behavior, despite emaciation.

We recruited fifteen patients with GSAD and nineteen healthy control (HC) participants, all of whom underwent a baseline resting-state fMRI scan. The GSAD patients underwent an additional fMRI scan after group cognitive behavior therapy (GCBT). Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and degree centrality (DC) measures were used to examine altered regional and integrated spontaneous brain activity in group comparisons. After GCBT, ALFF of the right precuneus decreased. At baseline, the GSAD group showed higher ALFF in the left precuneus and the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and lower ALFF in the lingual gyrus compared with the HC group. The DC of the left precuneus and the MTG were attenuated and the right putamen increased in the post-treatment group. The changes in DC in the precuneus were positively correlated with changes in clinical symptom. The abnormal ALFF of the precuneus, MTG and lingual gyrus may be the neural underpinning of GSAD, whereas the neural response to symptom remission after GCBT was achieved by a rebalance within the default mode network.

Nineteen schizophrenia patients with persistent AVH (HP), fourteen non-hallucinating schizophrenia patients (nHP) and twenty healthy controls (HC) underwent R-fMRI. LFF values were calculated in the slow frequency band (0.01-0.08Hz). By means of group level contrasts, we performed direct voxel-wise group comparisons. Both groups of patients showed decreased amplitude LFF (ALFF) values in the occipital pole and lingual gyrus compared to HC, whereas increased ALFF values were found in the temporal pole and fusifom gyrus. Schizophrenia patients exhibited decreased fractional ALFF (fALFF) values in the precuneus, occipital pole and bilateral occipital cortex, and increased fALFF in the insula compared to HC. There were also differences between patients with and without AVH. (Ok to start with lower case?) fALFF values were higher in the putamen and insular cortex and lower in the frontal pole in HP compared to nHP and HC. ALFF increased in HP patients in the bilateral thalamus and bilateral parahippocampal gyrus, compared to nHP patients and HC. Our results suggest that altered dynamics in low-frequency fluctuations may play a key role in the neurophysiology of auditory hallucinations. ",
pmid_22465843,The influence of emotional priming on the neural substrates of memory: a prospective fMRI study using portrait art stimuli.,,"Events coupled with an emotional context seem to be better retained than non-emotional events. The aim of our study was to investigate whether an emotional context could influence the neural substrates of memory associations with novel portrait art stimuli. In the current prospective fMRI study, we have investigated for one specific visual art form (modern artistic portraits with a high degree of abstraction) whether memory is influenced by priming with emotional facial pictures. In total forty healthy female volunteers in the same age range were recruited for the study. Twenty of these women participated in a prospective brain imaging memory paradigm and were asked to memorize a series of similar looking, but different portraits. After randomization, for twelve participants (Group 1), a third of the portraits was emotionally primed with approach-related pictures (smiling baby faces), a third with withdrawal-related pictures (baby faces with severe dermatological conditions), and another third with neutral images. Group 2 consisted of eight participants and they were not primed. Then, during an fMRI session 2h later, these portraits were viewed in random order intermixed with a set of new (previously unseen) ones, and the participants had to decide for each portrait whether or not they had already been seen. In a separate experiment, a different sample of twenty healthy females (Group 3) rated their mood after being exposed to the same art stimuli, without priming. The portraits did not evoke significant mood changes by themselves, supporting their initial neutral emotional character (Group 3). The correct decision on whether the portraits were Familiar of Unfamiliar led to similar neuronal activations in brain areas implicated in visual and attention processing for both groups (Groups 1 and 2). In contrast, whereas primed participants showed significant higher neuronal activities in the left midline superior frontal cortex (Brodmann area (BA) 6), unprimed volunteers displayed higher right medial frontal cortical (BA 10) activities. Furthermore, specifically in Group 1, correct retrieval of negatively primed portraits evoked increased neuronal activity in the left medial orbitofrontal cortex (BA 11) and in the right (posterior) insula, suggesting enhanced stress-related responses to the memory of withdrawal-related primed modern artistic portraits in this group. Our prospective memory data in healthy females indicate that, to reach a correct retrieval decision, different midline anterior neuronal networks are recruited for portraits that were emotionally primed than for the unprimed ones. Importantly, our results also suggest that the negative emotional context leads to the formation of associations that are reactivated during memory retrieval processes of the initially neutral art portraits. When correctly recognized, the portraits evoke neuronal activities consistent with the withdrawal-related character of the emotional visual stimuli with which they have been associated. Although our results show that abstract portrait art can be associated with emotional primes this doesn't mean that this effect is specific for art images. ",
pmid_16046146,The integrated response of the human cerebro-cerebellar and limbic systems to acupuncture stimulation at ST 36 as evidenced by fMRI.,,"Clinical and experimental data indicate that most acupuncture clinical results are mediated by the central nervous system, but the specific effects of acupuncture on the human brain remain unclear. Even less is known about its effects on the cerebellum. This fMRI study demonstrated that manual acupuncture at ST 36 (Stomach 36, Zusanli), a main acupoint on the leg, modulated neural activity at multiple levels of the cerebro-cerebellar and limbic systems. The pattern of hemodynamic response depended on the psychophysical response to needle manipulation. Acupuncture stimulation typically elicited a composite of sensations termed deqi that is related to clinical efficacy according to traditional Chinese medicine. The limbic and paralimbic structures of cortical and subcortical regions in the telencephalon, diencephalon, brainstem and cerebellum demonstrated a concerted attenuation of signal intensity when the subjects experienced deqi. When deqi was mixed with sharp pain, the hemodynamic response was mixed, showing a predominance of signal increases instead. Tactile stimulation as control also elicited a predominance of signal increase in a subset of these regions. The study provides preliminary evidence for an integrated response of the human cerebro-cerebellar and limbic systems to acupuncture stimulation at ST 36 that correlates with the psychophysical response.

A dysfunction in mirroring mechanisms (through action imitation) has been proposed by some studies to explain this, although some recent evidence points against this hypothesis. The current study used behavior and functional MRI to examine the integrated functioning of the regions that are considered part of the Action Imitation network (AIN) in children and adolescents with ASD during a motor imitation task. Fourteen ASD and 15 age-and-IQ-matched typically developing (TD) children were asked to imitate a series of hand gestures in the MRI scanner. Intact performance on imitation (accurate imitation of hand gestures outside the scanner) in both ASD and TD groups was accompanied by significantly lower activity in ASD participants, relative to TD, in right angular gyrus, precentral gyrus, and left middle cingulate. In addition, autism traits were found to be significantly correlated with activation in the right angular gyrus. Overall, the findings of this study support the role of AIN in imitation and a potential difference in the recruitment of this network in ASD children. ",

In the current study, we aimed to explore abnormal RSNs related to memory deficits in aMCI patients compared to the aged-matched healthy control group using RS-fMRI techniques. Firstly, we used ALFF (amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation) method to define the regions of interest (ROIs) which exhibited significant changes in aMCI compared with the control group. Then, we divided these ROIs into different networks in line with prior studies. The aim of this study is to explore the functional connectivity between these ROIs within networks and also to investigate the connectivity between networks. Comparing aMCI to the control group, our results showed that 1) the hippocampus (HIPP) had decreased FC with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and inferior parietal lobe (IPL), and the mPFC showed increased connectivity to IPL in the default mode network; 2) the thalamus showed decreased FC with the putamen and HIPP, and the HIPP showed increased connectivity to the putamen in the limbic system; 3) the supplementary motor area had decreased FC with the middle temporal gyrus and increased FC with the superior parietal lobe in the sensorimotor network; 4) increased connectivity between the lingual gyrus and middle occipital gyrus in the visual network; and 5) the DMN has reduced inter-network connectivities with the SMN and VN. These findings indicated that functional brain networks involved in cognition such as episodic memory, sensorimotor and visual cognition in aMCI were altered, and provided a new sight in understanding the important subtype of aMCI.

pmid_30720579,Transcutaneous Neuromodulation at ST36 (Zusanli) is More Effective than Transcutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation in Treating Constipation.,,"Combined transcutaneous neuromodulation (TN) at acupoint ST36 (Zusanli) and TN at the posterior tibial nerve (PTN) has been reported effective in treating functional constipation. This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of TN between these 2 points. Eighteen functional constipation patients (M/F: 9/9) were recruited to participate in a cross-over study with a 2-week TN at ST36 and a 2-week TN at PTN. A bowel movement diary, and the questionnaires of Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptom (PAC-SYM) and Constipation Quality of Life (PAC-QoL) were completed; anorectal manometry and spectral analysis of heart rate variability for assessing the autonomic function were performed. (1) Both TN at ST36 and TN at PTN improved constipation-related symptoms (PAC-SYM scores on pre-TN vs. post-TN: 1.4±0.1 vs. 0.6±0.1 for ST36, 1.4±0.1 vs. 0.9±0.1 for PTN, both P≤0.001). (2) TN at ST36, but not TN at PTN, increased the number of weekly spontaneous bowel movements (0.9±0.2 pre-TN vs. 3.5±0.7 post-TN, P<0.001) and decreased the total PAC-QoL score. TN at ST36 was more potent than TN at PTN in improving the PAC-SYM score (decrement 0.8±0.1 vs. 0.5±0.1, P<0.05). (3) TN at ST36 rather than TN at PTN resulted in a reduction in sensation thresholds, including rectal distention for urge (134.1±14.3 mL pre-TN vs. 85.6±6.5 mL post-TN, P<0.01) and maximum tolerance (P<0.05). (4) Both TN at ST36 and TN at PTN significantly increased vagal activity and decreased sympathetic activity (P<0.05). TN at ST36 is more potent than TN at PTN in treating constipation and improving constipation-related symptoms and rectal sensation. ",
pmid_30964611,Nonacceptance of negative emotions in women with borderline personality disorder: association with neuroactivity of the dorsal striatum.,,"Emotion dysfunction is a key symptom in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and is considered a consequence of dysfunctional emotion regulation (e.g., reduced emotion acceptance). In the present functional MRI (fMRI) study, we investigated the neural correlates of habitual emotion acceptance in individuals with BPD. Female patients with BPD and female healthy controls passively viewed negative and neutral movie clips of faces during fMRI. We assessed emotion acceptance using the Emotion Acceptance Questionnaire (EAQ). To examine brain activation associated with habitual emotional acceptance of negative stimuli, the EAQ score was included as a regressor of interest in brain data analyses of activation intensity during negative compared with neutral movies. We included 20 women with BPD and 20 heatlhy controls in our analysis. Compared with healthy controls, patients with BPD showed significantly more activation in frontostriatal brain regions (i.e., left superior frontal gyrus, right caudate) as well as in the left precuneus, left precentral gyrus, left posterior cingulate cortex and left hippocampus when confronted with negative (v. neutral) stimuli. Patients with BPD reported decreased emotion acceptance compared with healthy controls, and habitual emotion acceptance was inversely associated with activation of striatal areas (i.e., left putamen, left caudate) in patients with BPD. Causal conclusions are not possible. Comorbid diagnoses were not excluded, and only female participants were investigated. Stimuli were not rated immediately and may not be generalizable to all negative emotions. We cannot make any statements about other emotion-regulation strategies that may have been applied here. Data indicate that striatal hyperactivation during the processing of negative stimuli in women with BPD is related to their decreased disposition to accept unpleasant emotional states. Thus, individuals with BPD may benefit from therapy approaches that focus on emotion acceptance in order to normalize emotional reactions. ",

resting-state functional magnetic resonance","Apathy is among the most prevalent and incapacitating non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). PD patients with apathy (PD-A) have been reported to have abnormal spontaneous brain activity mainly in 0.01-0.08 Hz. However, the frequency-dependence of brain activity in PD-A remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to examine whether abnormalities in PD-A are associated with specific frequency bands. Overall, 28 patients with PD-A, 19 PD patients without apathy (PD-NA), and 32 gender-, age-matched healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled. We collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data, demographic information, and neuropsychological assessments, including apathy, depression, anxiety and cognitive function for every participant. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF), percent amplitude of fluctuation (PerAF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and degree centrality (DC) were calculated in the conventional (0.01-0.08 Hz), slow-4 (0.027-0.073 Hz), and slow-5 (0.01-0.027 Hz) frequency bands based on statistical parametric mapping (SPM12) and RESTplus V1.25. Two-sample  PD-A reduced ALFF in the right anterior cingulate gyri in the slow-5 band and decreased fALFF in the right middle frontal gyrus in the conventional band, compared to patients with PD-NA. However, PerAF, ReHo, and DC could not distinguish PD-A from PD-NA in the three bands. PD-A had higher ALFF and fALFF in the left middle occipital gyrus and lower fALFF in the bilateral insula in the slow-5 band compared to the HCs. Furthermore, abnormal DC value in hippocampus and parahippocampus was observed separately in the conventional band and in the slow-4 band between PD-A and HCs. Moreover, PD-A and PD-NA showed lower ReHo in cerebellum in the three bands compared to the HCs. Our study revealed that PD-A and PD-NA might have different neurophysiological mechanisms. Concurrently, the ALFF in the slow-5 band and fALFF in the conventional band were sensitive in differentiating PD-A from PD-NA. The influence of apathy on the disease can be considered in the future research on PD, with the effects of frequency band taken into account when analyzing spontaneous brain activities in PD-A. ",

Longitudinal DTI
Medial temporal lobe
Probabilistic fiber tractography","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive limb and/or bulbar muscular weakness and atrophy. Although ALS-related alterations of motor and extra-motor neuronal networks have repeatedly been reported, their temporal dynamics during disease progression are not well understood. Recently, we reported a decline of motor system activity and a concurrent increase of hippocampal novelty-evoked modulations across 3 months of ALS progression. To address whether these functional changes are associated with structural ones, the current study employed probabilistic fiber tractography on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data using a longitudinal design. Therein, motor network integrity was assessed by DTI-based tracking of the intracranial corticospinal tract, while connectivity estimates of occipito-temporal tracts (between visual and entorhinal, perirhinal or parahippocampal cortices) served to assess structural changes that could be related to the increased novelty-evoked hippocampal activity across time described previously. Complementing these previous functional observations, the current data revealed an ALS-related decrease in corticospinal tract structural connectivity compared to controls, while in contrast, visuo-perirhinal connectivity was relatively increased in the patient group. Importantly, beyond these between-group differences, a rise in the patients' occipito-temporal tract strengths occurred across a 3-month interval, while at the same time no changes in corticospinal tract connectivity were observed. In line with previously identified functional alterations, the dynamics of these structural changes suggest that the affection of motor- and memory-related networks in ALS emerges at distinct disease stages: while motor network degeneration starts primarily during early (supposedly pre-symptomatic) phases, the hippocampal/medial temporal lobe dysfunctions arise at later stages of the disease.

The aim of the study is to explore the effect of the combination stimulus of Hegu (LI4) and Taichong (LR3) on the resting-state brain networks in AD, beyond the default network (DMN). Twenty-eight subjects including 14 AD patients and 14 healthy controls (HCs) matched by age, gender, and educational level were recruited in this study. After the baseline resting-state MRI scans, the manual acupuncture stimulation was performed for 3 minutes, and then, another 10 minutes of resting-state fMRI scans was acquired. In addition to the DMN, five other resting-state networks were identified by independent component analysis (ICA), including left frontal parietal network (lFPN), right frontal parietal network (rFPN), visual network (VN), sensorimotor network (SMN), and auditory network (AN). And the impaired connectivity in the lFPN, rFPN, SMN, and VN was found in AD patients compared with those in HCs.

Despite the efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy, the neurobiological underpinnings and mechanisms underlying electroconvulsive therapy induced antidepressant effects remain unclear. The objective of this investigation was to identify electroconvulsive therapy treatment responsive multimodal biomarkers with the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale guided brain structure-function fusion in 118 patients with depressive episodes and 60 healthy controls. Results show that reduced fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations in the prefrontal cortex, insula and hippocampus, linked with increased gray matter volume in anterior cingulate, medial temporal cortex, insula, thalamus, caudate and hippocampus represent electroconvulsive therapy responsive covarying functional and structural brain networks. In addition, relative to nonresponders, responder-specific electroconvulsive therapy related brain networks occur in frontal-limbic network and are associated with successful therapeutic outcomes. Finally, electroconvulsive therapy responsive brain networks were unrelated to verbal declarative memory. Using a data-driven, supervised-learning method, we demonstrated that electroconvulsive therapy produces a remodeling of brain functional and structural covariance that was unique to antidepressant symptom response, but not linked to memory impairment.

Additionally, the effects of different attentional demands in wm tasks were analysed. A wm paradigm was applied, in which stimuli were presented in a 2-back and a 0-back condition in a non-degraded and degraded version. As hypothesized in healthy controls increased activity during both 2-back tasks was found in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), parietal regions, the thalamus and the cerebellum. Different activation patterns were found for the cingulate cortex in the 2-back degraded conditions. The comparison between healthy controls and schizophrenic patients revealed decreased activity in the right VLPFC in patients as well as increased activity in temporal regions. Furthermore patients' task performance quality was significantly lower for 2-back conditions. Schizophrenic patients use different cognitive strategies to solve working memory tasks, reflected in significantly altered cerebral activity. However, the different fMRI working memory correlates found in schizophrenic patients seem to be insufficient in terms of overall task performance. ",
pmid_16837057,Processing of autobiographical memory retrieval cues in borderline personality disorder.,,"Affective dysregulation in borderline personality disorder (BPD) in response to both external stimuli and memories has been shown to be associated with functional alterations of limbic and prefrontal brain areas. This study aimed to examine neuronal networks involved in autobiographical memory retrieval using standardized stimuli that gain autobiographical significance by illustrating marked solitary and social situations of human life. Using event-related functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), we examined the processing of pictures from the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) in 14 BPD patients and 14 controls. In both groups, TAT stimuli activated brain areas known to be involved in autobiographical memory retrieval. BPD subjects lacked differential amygdala, orbitofrontal and cingulate activations for TAT versus neutral stimuli. In the TAT condition, compared to controls, BPD subjects displayed increased BOLD responses in the bilateral orbitofrontal and insular regions, in the left anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex, as well as in the parietal and parahippocampal areas, consistent with a more aversive and arousing experience assessed by self-reports. Increased BOLD responses during TAT processing in BPD subjects were in line with previously reported changes in anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices, which are known to be involved in memory retrieval. However, BPD subjects displayed hyperactivation in these areas for both TAT and neutral stimuli. The deficit of selective activation of areas involved in autobiographical memory retrieval suggests a general tendency towards a self-referential mode of information processing in BPD, or a failure to switch between emotionally salient and neutral stimuli.

pmid_19172654,Differential force scaling of fine-graded power grip force in the sensorimotor network.,,"Force scaling in the sensorimotor network during generation and control of static or dynamic grip force has been the subject of many investigations in monkeys and human subjects. In human, the relationship between BOLD signal in cortical and subcortical regions and force still remains controversial. With respect to grip force, the modulation of the BOLD signal has been mostly studied for forces often reaching high levels while little attention has been given to the low range for which electrophysiological neuronal correlates have been demonstrated. We thus conducted a whole-brain fMRI study on the control of fine-graded force in the low range, using a power grip and three force conditions in a block design. Participants generated on a dynamometer visually guided repetitive force pulses (ca. 0.5 Hz), reaching target forces of 10%, 20%, and 30% of maximum voluntary contraction. Regions of interest analysis disclosed activation in the entire cortical and subcortical sensorimotor network and significant force-related modulation in several regions, including primary motor (M1) and somatosensory cortex, ventral premotor and inferior parietal areas, and cerebellum. The BOLD signal, however, increased monotonically with force only in contralateral M1 and ipsilateral anterior cerebellum. The remaining regions were activated with force in various nonlinear manners, suggesting that other factors such as visual input, attention, and muscle recruitment also modulate the BOLD signal in this visuomotor task. These findings demonstrate that various regions of the sensorimotor network participate differentially in the production and control of fine-graded grip forces. ",

The aim of this study was to identify the characteristics of brain morphometry in patients with schizophrenia and a history of serious violent acts, who were being treated under relatively new legislation for offenders with mental illness in Japan where their relevant action should be strongly associated with their mental illness. We also investigated whether morphometric changes would depend on types of serious violent actions or not. Thirty-four male patients with schizophrenia who were hospitalized after committing serious violent acts were compared with 23 male outpatients or inpatients with schizophrenia and no history of violent acts. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with voxel-based morphometry was used to assess gray matter volume. Additionally, patients with violent acts were divided based on whether their relevant actions were premeditated or not. The regional volumes of these two groups were compared to those of the control patient group. Patients with schizophrenia and a history of serious violent acts showed significantly smaller regional volumes of the right inferior temporal area expanded to the middle temporal gyrus and the temporal pole, and the right insular area compared to patients without a history of violence. Patients with premeditated violent acts showed significantly smaller regional volumes of the right inferior temporal area, the right insular area, the left planum polare area including the insula, and the bilateral precuneus area including the posterior cingulate gyrus than those without a history of violence, whereas patients with impulsive violent acts showed significantly smaller volumes of only the right inferior temporal area compared to those without a history of violence. Patients with schizophrenia and a history of serious violent acts showed structural differences in some brain regions compared to those with schizophrenia and no history of violence. Abnormalities in the right inferior temporal area were relatively common but did not depend on whether the violent actions were premeditated or not, and abnormalities in a wider range may be attributed to not only planning the violent action against others but also to maintaining that plan.

pmid_18722390,A somatic marker theory of addiction.,,"Similar to patients with ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPC) lesions, substance abusers show altered decision-making, characterized by a tendency to choose the immediate reward, at the expense of negative future consequences. The somatic marker model proposes that decision-making depends on neural substrates that regulate homeostasis, emotion and feeling. According to this model, there should be a link between alterations in processing emotions in substance abusers, and their impairments in decision-making. Growing evidence from neuroscientific studies indicate that core aspects of addiction may be explained in terms of abnormal emotional/homeostatic guidance of decision-making. Behavioral studies have revealed emotional processing and decision-making deficits in substance abusers. Neuroimaging studies have shown that altered decision-making in addiction is associated with abnormal functioning of a distributed neural network critical for the processing of emotional information, and the experience of ""craving"", including the VMPC, the amygdala, the striatum, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the insular/somato-sensory cortices, as well as non-specific neurotransmitter systems that modulate activities of neural processes involved in decision-making. The aim of this paper is to review this growing evidence, and to examine the extent to which these studies support a somatic marker theory of addiction. We conclude that there are at least two underlying types of dysfunction where emotional signals (somatic markers) turn in favor of immediate outcomes in addiction: (1) a hyperactivity in the amygdala or impulsive system, which exaggerates the rewarding impact of available incentives, and (2) hypoactivity in the prefrontal cortex or reflective system, which forecasts the long-term consequences of a given action.

But functional relationships between this area and other regions remain unclear. Region of interest-based correlation analyses were performed in the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data to examine differences in functional connectivity (FC) of the hippocampus between medication-naïve patients with MDD and healthy adults. Correlation analyses were done between clinical variables and the strength of FC in regions showing group differences. Positive FC with the hippocampal-ROIs was seen in bilateral limbic system, subcortical areas, temporal lobe, medial and inferior prefrontal cortex while negative FC was observed in bilateral prefrontal cortex, parietal and occipital cortex and the cerebellum. Group comparison showed impaired functional connections of the hippocampus in MDD, with a lack of negative FC in left hippocampal-ROI to bilateral middle frontal gyrus, as well as decreased negative FC in right hippocampal-ROI to right inferior parietal cortex and the cerebellum. Negative correlations were seen between illness duration and the strength of FC in the prefrontal and parietal cortex. An optimized method taking individual variability of hippocampal volume into account is merited for the definition of seed regions and computation of FC. Further studies recruiting subjects with subthreshold depressive symptoms are needed. Abnormal functional relationships between the hippocampus and cortical areas may underlie the pathophysiology of MDD. ",
pmid_27247279,Changes of intranetwork and internetwork functional connectivity in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.,,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious neurodegenerative disorder characterized by deficits of working memory, attention, language and many other cognitive functions. Although different stages of the disease are relatively well characterized by clinical criteria, stage-specific pathological changes in the brain remain relatively poorly understood, especially at the level of large-scale functional networks. In this study, we aimed to characterize the potential disruptions of large-scale functional brain networks based on a sample including amnestic mild cognition impairment (aMCI) and AD patients to help delineate the underlying stage-dependent AD pathology. We sought to identify the neural connectivity mechanisms of aMCI and AD through examination of both intranetwork and internetwork interactions among four of the brain's key networks, namely dorsal attention network (DAN), default mode network (DMN), executive control network (ECN) and salience network (SAL). We analyzed functional connectivity based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data from 25 Alzheimer's disease patients, 20 aMCI patients and 35 elderly normal controls (NC). Intranetwork functional disruptions within the DAN and ECN were detected in both aMCI and AD patients. Disrupted intranetwork connectivity of DMN and anti-correlation between DAN and DMN were observed in AD patients. Moreover, aMCI-specific alterations in the internetwork functional connectivity of SAL were observed. Our results confirmed previous findings that AD pathology was related to dysconnectivity both within and between resting-state networks but revealed more spatial details. Moreover, the SAL network, reportedly flexibly coupling either with the DAN or DMN networks during different brain states, demonstrated interesting alterations specifically in the early stage of the disease.

While a number of functional neuroimaging studies on emotional processing have been performed in antisocial adults, little is known about how CD children process emotional information. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were analyzed in 22 male adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with childhood-onset CD (16 of them with comorbid ADHD) compared to 22 age-matched male healthy controls. In order to consider the likely confounding of results through ADHD comorbidity, we performed a supplementary study including 13 adolescent subjects with pure ADHD who were compared with healthy controls. To challenge emotional processing of stimuli, a passive viewing task was applied, presenting pictures of negative, positive or neutral valence. When comparing CD/combined disorder patients with healthy controls, we found enhanced left-sided amygdala activation in response to negative pictures as compared to neutral pictures in the patient group. In addition, these boys exhibited no reduced activation in the orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate and insular cortices. By contrast, children with pure ADHD did not show any abnormalities in amygdala activation but showed decreased neural activity in the insula only in response to negative pictures. Increased rather than reduced amygdala activation found in our study may indicate an enhanced response to environmental cues in adolescents with early-onset CD (most of whom also met the condition of ADHD), and is not consistent with the assumption of a reduced capacity to take note of affective information in the social environment. Further studies with an emphasis on developmental aspects of affect regulation are needed to clarify the relationship between CD and adult personality pathology associated with different modes of persistent antisocial behavior.

spatial frequency","Perception of visual stimuli improves with training, but improvements are specific for trained stimuli rendering the development of generic training programs challenging. It remains unknown to which extent training of low-level visual features transfers to high-level visual perception, and whether this is accompanied by neuroplastic changes. The current event-related potential (ERP) study showed that training-induced increased sensitivity to a low-level feature, namely low spatial frequency (LSF), alters neural processing of this feature in high-level visual stimuli. Specifically, neural activity related to face processing (N170), was decreased for low (trained) but not high (untrained) SF content in faces following LSF training. These novel results suggest that: (1) SF discrimination learning transfers from simple stimuli to complex objects; and that (2) training the use of specific SF information affects neural processing of facial information. These findings may open up a new avenue to improve face recognition skills in individuals with atypical SF processing, such as in cataract or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). ",
pmid_21078704,Association of frontal and posterior cortical gray matter volume with time to alcohol relapse: a prospective study.,,"Alcoholism is associated with gray matter volume deficits in frontal and other brain regions. Whether persistent brain volume deficits in abstinence are predictive of subsequent time to alcohol relapse has not been established. The authors measured gray matter volumes in healthy volunteers and in a sample of treatment-engaged, alcohol-dependent patients after 1 month of abstinence and assessed whether smaller frontal gray matter volume was predictive of subsequent alcohol relapse outcomes. Forty-five abstinent alcohol-dependent patients in treatment and 50 healthy comparison subjects were scanned once using high-resolution (T(1)-weighted) structural MRI, and voxel-based morphometry was used to assess regional brain volume differences between the groups. A prospective study design was used to assess alcohol relapse in the alcohol-dependent group for 90 days after discharge from 6 weeks of inpatient treatment. Significantly smaller gray matter volume in alcohol-dependent patients relative to comparison subjects was seen in three regions: the medial frontal cortex, the right lateral prefrontal cortex, and a posterior region surrounding the parietal-occipital sulcus. Smaller medial frontal and parietal-occipital gray matter volumes were each predictive of shorter time to any alcohol use and to heavy drinking relapse. These findings are the first to demonstrate that gray matter volume deficits in specific medial frontal and posterior parietal-occipital brain regions are predictive of an earlier return to alcohol use and relapse risk, suggesting a significant role for gray matter atrophy in poor clinical outcomes in alcoholism. Extent of gray matter volume deficits in these regions could serve as useful neural markers of relapse risk and alcoholism treatment outcome. ",
pmid_18985136,Amygdala-frontal connectivity during emotion regulation.,,"Successful control of affect partly depends on the capacity to modulate negative emotional responses through the use of cognitive strategies (i.e., reappraisal). Recent studies suggest the involvement of frontal cortical regions in the modulation of amygdala reactivity and the mediation of effective emotion regulation. However, within-subject inter-regional connectivity between amygdala and prefrontal cortex in the context of affect regulation is unknown. Here, using psychophysiological interaction analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we show that activity in specific areas of the frontal cortex (dorsolateral, dorsal medial, anterior cingulate, orbital) covaries with amygdala activity and that this functional connectivity is dependent on the reappraisal task. Moreover, strength of amygdala coupling with orbitofrontal cortex and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex predicts the extent of attenuation of negative affect following reappraisal. These findings highlight the importance of functional connectivity within limbic-frontal circuitry during emotion regulation. ",

Recent investigations suggest power spectrum scale invariance (PSSI) of cerebral blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals as a neural marker of cerebral activity. We examined here how PSSI is altered in association with cocaine misuse and impaired cognitive control. Eighty-eight healthy (HC) and seventy-five age and gender matched cocaine dependent (CD) adults participated in functional MRI of a stop signal task (SST). BOLD images were preprocessed using standard procedures in SPM, including detrending, band-pass filtering (0.01-0.25 Hz), and correction for head motions. Voxel-wise PSSI measures were estimated by a linear fit of the power spectrum with a log-log scale. In group analyses, we examined differences in PSSI between HC and CD, and its association with clinical and behavioral variables using a multiple regression. A critical component of cognitive control is post-signal behavioral adjustment, which is compromised in cocaine dependence. Therefore, we examined the PSSI changes in association with post-signal slowing (PSS) in the SST. Compared to HC, CD showed decreased PSS and PSSI in multiple frontoparietal regions. PSSI was positively correlated with PSS in HC in multiple regions, including the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and right supramarginal gyrus (SMG), which showed reduced PSSI in CD. These findings suggest disrupted connectivity dynamics in the fronto-parietal areas in association with post-signal behavioral adjustment in cocaine addicts. These new findings support PSSI as a neural marker of impaired cognitive control in cocaine addiction. ",

Human beings, however, often violate this basic rule of economics and take 'sunk' costs into account when making decisions about current or future investments, thus exhibiting a so-called 'sunk cost effect'. Although the sunk cost effect may have serious political, financial or personal consequences, its neural basis is largely unknown. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a novel financial decision-making task, we show here that previous investments reduced the contribution of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) to current decision-making and that this reduction in vmPFC activity correlated with the sunk cost effect. Moreover, activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) was associated with the norm not to waste resources and negatively correlated with vmPFC activity. The present findings show how past investments may bias decision-making in the human brain, suggesting that the interaction of vmPFC and dlPFC may promote a tendency to throw good money after bad.

Temporo-parietal-junction","During joint action, two or more persons depend on each other to accomplish a goal. This mutual recursion, or circular dependency, is one of the characteristics of cooperation. To evaluate the neural substrates of cooperation, we conducted a hyperscanning functional MRI study in which 19 dyads performed a joint force-production task. The goal of the task was to match their average grip forces to the target value (20% of their maximum grip forces) through visual feedback over a 30-s period; the task required taking into account other-produced force to regulate the self-generated one in real time, which represented cooperation. Time-series data of the dyad's exerted grip forces were recorded, and the noise contribution ratio (NCR), a measure of influence from the partner, was computed using a multivariate autoregressive model to identify the degree to which each participant's grip force was explained by that of their partner's, i.e., the degree of cooperation. Compared with the single force-production task, the joint task enhanced the NCR and activated the mentalizing system, including the medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and bilateral posterior subdivision of the temporoparietal junction (TPJ). In addition, specific activation of the anterior subdivision of the right TPJ significantly and positively correlated with the NCR across participants during the joint task. The effective connectivity of the anterior to posterior TPJ was upregulated when participants coordinated their grip forces. Finally, the joint task enhanced cross-brain functional connectivity of the right anterior TPJ, indicating shared attention toward the temporal patterns of the motor output of the partner. Since the posterior TPJ is part of the mentalizing system for tracking the intention of perceived agents, our findings indicate that cooperation, i.e., the degree of adjustment of individual motor output depending on that of the partner, is mediated by the interconnected subdivisions of the right TPJ.

pmid_25647224,Characteristics of internet addiction/pathological internet use in U.S. university students: a qualitative-method investigation.,,"Studies have identified high rates and severe consequences of Internet Addiction/Pathological Internet Use (IA/PIU) in university students. However, most research concerning IA/PIU in U.S. university students has been conducted within a quantitative research paradigm, and frequently fails to contextualize the problem of IA/PIU. To address this gap, we conducted an exploratory qualitative study using the focus group approach and examined 27 U.S. university students who self-identified as intensive Internet users, spent more than 25 hours/week on the Internet for non-school or non-work-related activities and who reported Internet-associated health and/or psychosocial problems. Students completed two IA/PIU measures (Young's Diagnostic Questionnaire and the Compulsive Internet Use Scale) and participated in focus groups exploring the natural history of their Internet use; preferred online activities; emotional, interpersonal, and situational triggers for intensive Internet use; and health and/or psychosocial consequences of their Internet overuse. Students' self-reports of Internet overuse problems were consistent with results of standardized measures. Students first accessed the Internet at an average age of 9 (SD = 2.7), and first had a problem with Internet overuse at an average age of 16 (SD = 4.3). Sadness and depression, boredom, and stress were common triggers of intensive Internet use. Social media use was nearly universal and pervasive in participants' lives. Sleep deprivation, academic under-achievement, failure to exercise and to engage in face-to-face social activities, negative affective states, and decreased ability to concentrate were frequently reported consequences of intensive Internet use/Internet overuse. IA/PIU may be an underappreciated problem among U.S. university students and warrants additional research. ",
pmid_29579064,Neural processing of food and emotional stimuli in adolescent and adult anorexia nervosa patients.,,"A constant preoccupation with food and restrictive eating are main symptoms of anorexia nervosa (AN). Imaging studies revealed aberrant neural activation patterns in brain regions processing hedonic and reward reactions as well as-potentially aversive-emotions. An imbalance between so called ""bottom-up"" and ""top-down"" control areas is discussed. The present study is focusing on neural processing of disease-specific food stimuli and emotional stimuli and its developmental course in adolescent and adult AN patients and could offer new insight into differential mechanisms underlying shorter or more chronic disease. 33 adolescents aged 12-18 years (15 AN patients, 18 control participants) and 32 adult women (16 AN patients, 16 control participants) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI, 3T high-field scanner) while watching pictures of high and low-calorie food and affective stimuli. Afterwards, they rated subjective valence of each picture. FMRI data analysis was performed using a region of interest based approach. Pictures of high-calorie food items were rated more negatively by AN patients. Differences in activation between patients and controls were found in ""bottom up"" and ""top down"" control areas for food stimuli and in several emotion processing regions for affective stimuli which were more pronounced in adolescents than in adults. A differential pattern was seen for food stimuli compared to generally emotion eliciting stimuli. Adolescents with AN show reduced processing of affective stimuli and enhanced activation of regions involved in ""bottom up"" reward processing and ""top down"" control as well as the insula with regard to food stimuli with a focus on brain regions which underlie changes during adolescent development. In adults less clear and less specific activation differences were present, pointing towards a high impact that regions undergoing maturation might have on AN symptoms. ",
pmid_20164333,Distinct value signals in anterior and posterior ventromedial prefrontal cortex.,,"The core feature of an economic exchange is a decision to trade one good for another, based on a comparison of relative value. Economists have long recognized, however, that the value an individual ascribes to a good during decision making (i.e., their relative willingness to trade for that good) does not always map onto the reward they actually experience. Here, we show that experienced value and decision value are represented in distinct regions of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) during the passive consumption of rewards. Participants viewed two categories of rewards-images of faces that varied in their attractiveness and monetary gains and losses-while being scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging. An independent market task, in which participants exchanged some of the money that they had earned for brief views of attractive faces, determined the relative decision value associated with each category. We found that activation of anterior VMPFC increased with increasing experienced value, but not decision value, for both reward categories. In contrast, activation of posterior VMPFC predicted each individual's relative decision value for face and monetary stimuli. These results indicate not only that experienced value and decision value are represented in distinct regions of VMPFC, but also that decision value signals are evident even in the absence of an overt choice task. We conclude that decisions are made by comparing neural representations of the value of different goods encoded in posterior VMPFC in a common, relative currency. ",
pmid_18654087,Altered verbal working memory process in patients with Alzheimer's disease: an fMRI investigation.,,"Impaired working memory processing is one of the broad range of cognitive deficits in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to elucidate the differences in brain activities involved in the process of working memory between AD patients and healthy comparison subjects. Twelve patients with AD were recruited along with 12 healthy volunteers as a comparison group. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was employed to assess cortical activities during the performance of a 1-back working memory paradigm using the Korean alphabet as mnemonic content. Subsequently, the difference in neural activities between the 2 groups was analyzed. The AD group performed the tasks with reduced accuracy. Group comparison analysis revealed that the AD group showed decreased brain activity in the left frontal pole (Brodmann area, BA, 10), the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (BA47), the left insula (BA13) and the right premotor cortex (BA6) compared to the control group. The AD group showed increased activation in the left precuneus (BA7) compared to the control group. A decreased level of activation in the prefrontal cortex and an increased level of activation in the parietal neural networks from the patient group may document an altered verbal working memory process in the patients with AD.

pmid_21044291,Acupuncture modulates temporal neural responses in wide brain networks: evidence from fMRI study.,,"Accumulating neuroimaging studies in humans have shown that acupuncture can modulate a widely distributed brain network, large portions of which are overlapped with the pain-related areas. Recently, a striking feature of acupuncture-induced analgesia is found to be associated with its long-last effect, which has a delayed onset and gradually reaches a peak even after acupuncture needling being terminated. Identifying temporal neural responses in these areas that occur at particular time--both acute and sustained effects during acupuncture processes--may therefore shed lights on how such peripheral inputs are conducted and mediated through the CNS. In the present study, we adopted a non-repeated event-related (NRER) fMRI paradigm and control theory based approach namely change-point analysis in order to capture the detailed temporal profile of neural responses induced by acupuncture. Our findings demonstrated that neural activities at the different stages of acupuncture presented distinct temporal patterns, in which consistently positive neural responses were found during the period of acupuncture needling while much more complex and dynamic activities found during a post-acupuncture period. These brain responses had a significant time-dependent effect which showed different onset time and duration of neural activities. The amygdala and perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC), exhibited increased activities during the needling phase while decreased gradually to reach a peak below the baseline. The periaqueductal gray (PAG) and hypothalamus presented saliently intermittent activations across the whole fMRI session. Apart from the time-dependent responses, relatively persistent activities were also identified in the anterior insula and prefrontal cortices. The overall findings indicate that acupuncture may engage differential temporal neural responses as a function of time in a wide range of brain networks. Our study has provided evidence supporting a view that acupuncture intervention involves complex modulations of temporal neural response, and its effect can gradually resolve as a function of time. The functional specificity of acupuncture at ST36 may involve multiple levels of differential activities of a wide range of brain networks, which are gradually enhanced even after acupuncture needle being terminated.

pmid_18281412,Reduced amygdala response to fearful expressions in children and adolescents with callous-unemotional traits and disruptive behavior disorders.,,"Extensive work implicates abnormal amygdala activation in emotional facial expression processing in adults with callous-unemotional traits. However, no research has examined amygdala response to emotional facial expressions in adolescents with disruptive behavior and callous-unemotional traits. Moreover, despite high comorbidity of callous-unemotional traits and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), no research has attempted to distinguish neural correlates of pediatric callous-unemotional traits and ADHD. Participants were 36 children and adolescents (ages 10-17 years); 12 had callous-unemotional traits and either conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder, 12 had ADHD, and 12 were healthy comparison subjects. Functional MRI was used to assess amygdala activation patterns during processing of fearful facial expressions. Patterns in the callous-unemotional traits group were compared with those in the ADHD and comparison groups. In youths with callous-unemotional traits, amygdala activation was reduced relative to healthy comparison subjects and youths with ADHD while processing fearful expressions, but not neutral or angry expressions. Functional connectivity analyses demonstrated greater correlations between the amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in comparison subjects and youths with ADHD relative to those with callous-unemotional traits. Symptom severity in the callous-unemotional traits groups was negatively correlated with connectivity between amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. This is the first study to demonstrate reduced amygdala responsiveness in youths with callous-unemotional traits. These findings support the contention that callous and unemotional personality traits are associated with reduced amygdala response to distress-based social cues. ",

visual attention","This study was designed to ascertain the relationship between visual attention for social information and oxytocin (OT) levels in Japanese preschool children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We hypothesized that poor visual attention for social information and low OT levels are crucially important risk factors associated with ASD. We measured the pattern of gaze fixation for social information using an eye-tracking system, and salivary OT levels by the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). There was a positive association between salivary OT levels and fixation duration for an indicated object area in a finger-pointing movie in typically developing (TD) children. However, no association was found between these variables in children with ASD. Moreover, age decreased an individual's attention to people moving and pointed-at objects, but increased attention for mouth-in-the-face recognition, geometric patterns, and biological motions. Thus, OT levels likely vary during visual attention for social information between TD children and those with ASD. Further, aging in preschool children has considerable effect on visual attention for social information. ",
pmid_16903802,Perception of human motion.,,"Humans, being highly social creatures, rely heavily on the ability to perceive what others are doing and to infer from gestures and expressions what others may be intending to do. These perceptual skills are easily mastered by most, but not all, people, in large part because human action readily communicates intentions and feelings. In recent years, remarkable advances have been made in our understanding of the visual, motoric, and affective influences on perception of human action, as well as in the elucidation of the neural concomitants of perception of human action. This article reviews those advances and, where possible, draws links among those findings. ",
pmid_22832566,The organization of the human striatum estimated by intrinsic functional connectivity.,,"The striatum is connected to the cerebral cortex through multiple anatomical loops that process sensory, limbic, and heteromodal information. Tract-tracing studies in the monkey reveal that these corticostriatal connections form stereotyped patterns in the striatum. Here the organization of the striatum was explored in the human with resting-state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI). Data from 1,000 subjects were registered with nonlinear deformation of the striatum in combination with surface-based alignment of the cerebral cortex. fcMRI maps derived from seed regions placed in the foot and tongue representations of the motor cortex yielded the expected inverted somatotopy in the putamen. fcMRI maps derived from the supplementary motor area were located medially to the primary motor representation, also consistent with anatomical studies. The topography of the complete striatum was estimated and replicated by assigning each voxel in the striatum to its most strongly correlated cortical network in two independent groups of 500 subjects. The results revealed at least five cortical zones in the striatum linked to sensorimotor, premotor, limbic, and two association networks with a topography globally consistent with monkey anatomical studies. The majority of the human striatum was coupled to cortical association networks. Examining these association networks further revealed details that fractionated the five major networks. The resulting estimates of striatal organization provide a reference for exploring how the striatum contributes to processing motor, limbic, and heteromodal information through multiple large-scale corticostriatal circuits.

pmid_17707869,Inefficient executive cognitive control in schizophrenia is preceded by altered functional activation during information encoding: an fMRI study.,,"Working memory deficits are a core feature of schizophrenia. Previous working memory studies suggest a load dependent storage deficit. However, explicit studies of higher executive working memory processes are limited. Moreover, few studies have examined whether subcomponents of working memory such as encoding and maintenance of information are differentially affected by these deficits. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the neural substrates of working memory subprocesses requiring stimulus encoding, maintenance and higher executive processing. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging a modified Sternberg working memory task involving verbal stimulus material was applied. The event-related design enabled the segregation of encoding, active maintenance and executive manipulation of information. Forty-one patients with schizophrenia and 41 healthy subjects were included. Relative to normal controls, schizophrenic patients demonstrated a significantly stronger activation pattern in a fronto-parietal network during executive information manipulation. Additionally, significant relative hypoactivity was detectable in the thalamus. Conversely, during stimulus encoding the patients demonstrated lower activation relative to controls in the prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate gyrus. The present findings indicate a pronounced prefrontal functional hyperactivation within the neural network subserving higher executive working memory control processes in schizophrenia. Moreover, they suggest that these altered activations during executive control are related to a preceding abnormality of information encoding. During encoding, a reduced activation in mainly dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate regions was observed. These results could be explained by increased top-down control processing from prefrontal cortex as a compensation for functional deficits occurring during encoding. ",

type 2 diabetes","Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have revealed abnormal neural activity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Nonetheless, these findings are heterogeneous and have not been quantitatively reviewed. Thus, we aimed to conduct a meta-analysis that identified consistent results of existing resting-state fMRI studies to determine concordant resting-state neural brain activity alterations in T2DM patients. A systematic search was conducted for resting-state fMRI studies comparing T2DM patients with healthy controls. Coordinates were extracted from clusters with significant differences. The meta-analysis was performed using the activation likelihood estimation method, and nine studies were included. This meta-analysis identified robustly reduced resting-state brain activity in the whole brain of T2DM patients, including the bilateral lingual gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, right inferior temporal gyrus, right cerebellar culmen, right insula and right posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). The present study demonstrates a characteristic pattern of resting-state brain anomalies that will contribute to the understanding of neuropathophysiological mechanisms underlying T2DM. ",

psychopharmacology","Empathy for pain activates brain areas partially overlapping with those underpinning the first-hand experience of pain. It remains unclear, however, whether such shared activations imply that pain empathy engages similar neural functions as first-hand pain experiences. To overcome the limitations of previous neuroimaging research, we pursued a conceptually novel approach: we used the phenomenon of placebo analgesia to experimentally reduce the first-hand experience of pain, and assessed whether this results in a concomitant reduction of empathy for pain. We first carried out a functional MRI experiment (n = 102) that yielded results in the expected direction: participants experiencing placebo analgesia also reported decreased empathy for pain, and this was associated with reduced engagement of anterior insular and midcingulate cortex: that is, areas previously associated with shared activations in pain and empathy for pain. In a second step, we used a psychopharmacological manipulation (n = 50) to determine whether these effects can be blocked via an opioid antagonist. The administration of the opioid antagonist naltrexone blocked placebo analgesia and also resulted in a corresponding ""normalization"" of empathy for pain. Taken together, these findings suggest that pain empathy may be associated with neural responses and neurotransmitter activity engaged during first-hand pain, and thus might indeed be grounded in our own pain experiences.

pmid_21543191,How can cognitive remediation therapy modulate brain activations in schizophrenia? An fMRI study.,,"Cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) is a non biological treatment that aims to correct cognitive deficits through repeated exercises. Its efficacy in patients with schizophrenia is well recognized, but little is known about its effect on cerebral activity. Our aim was to explore the impact of CRT on cerebral activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in patients with schizophrenia. Seventeen patients and 15 healthy volunteers were recruited. Patients were divided into two groups: one group received CRT with Rehacom® software (n=8), while a control group of patients (non-CRT group) received no additional treatment (n=9). The three groups underwent two fMRI sessions with an interval of 3months: they had to perform a verbal and a spatial n-back task at the same performance level. Patients were additionally clinically and cognitively assessed before and after the study. After CRT, the CRT group exhibited brain over-activations in the left inferior/middle frontal gyrus, cingulate gyrus and inferior parietal lobule for the spatial task. Similar but nonsignificant over-activations were observed in the same brain regions for the verbal task. Moreover, CRT patients significantly improved their behavioural performance in attention and reasoning capacities. We conclude that CRT leads to measurable physiological adaptation associated with improved cognitive ability.

Resting-state fMRI scans of 16 healthy controls, 17 BD and 16 UD patients were obtained. T-test of normalized regional homogeneity (ReHo) was performed in a voxel-by-voxel manner. A combined threshold of á = 0.05, minimum cluster volume of V = 10503 mm(3) (389 voxels) were used to determine ReHo differences between groups. In UD group, fMRI revealed ReHo increases in the left middle occipital lobe, right inferior parietal lobule, right precuneus and left convolution; and ReHo decreases in the left parahippocampalgyrus, right precentralgyrus, left postcentralgyrus, left precentralgyrus and left cingulated. In BD group, ReHo increases in the right insular cortex, left middle frontal gyrus, left precuneus, left occipital lobe, left parietal, left superior frontal gyrus and left thalamus; and ReHo decreases in the right anterior lobe of cerebellum, pons, right precentralgyrus, left postcentralgyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus, and right cingulate. There were some overlaps in ReHo profiles between UD and BD groups, but a marked difference was seen in the thalamus of BD. The resting-state fMRI and ReHo mapping are a promising tool to assist the detection of functional deficits and distinguish clinical and pathophysiological signs of BD and UD. ",

Performance of the two groups was equivalent on the figure task, but autistic children were significantly impaired on the biological motion task. This latter deficit may be related to the impaired social skills characteristic of autism, and we speculate that this deficit may implicate abnormalities in brain areas mediating perception of human movement.

pmid_22287214,Visual cognition in disorders of consciousness: from V1 to top-down attention.,,"What is it like to be at the lower boundaries of consciousness? Disorders of consciousness such as coma, the vegetative state, and the minimally conscious state are among the most mysterious and least understood conditions of the human brain. Particularly complicated is the assessment of residual cognitive functioning and awareness for diagnostic, rehabilitative, legal, and ethical purposes. In this article, we present a novel functional magnetic resonance imaging exploration of visual cognition in a patient with a severe disorder of consciousness. This battery of tests, first developed in healthy volunteers, assesses increasingly complex transformations of visual information along a known caudal to rostral gradient from occipital to temporal cortex. In the first five levels, the battery assesses (passive) processing of light, color, motion, coherent shapes, and object categories (i.e., faces, houses). At the final level, the battery assesses the ability to voluntarily deploy visual attention in order to focus on one of two competing stimuli. In the patient, this approach revealed appropriate brain activations, undistinguishable from those seen in healthy and aware volunteers. In addition, the ability of the patient to focus one of two competing stimuli, and switch between them on command, also suggests that he retained the ability to access, to some degree, his own visual representations.

pmid_15165352,Motor sequence complexity and performing hand produce differential patterns of hemispheric lateralization.,,"Studies in brain damaged patients conclude that the left hemisphere is dominant for controlling heterogeneous sequences performed by either hand, presumably due to the cognitive resources involved in planning complex sequential movements. To determine if this lateralized effect is due to asymmetries in primary sensorimotor or association cortex, whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure differences in volume of activation while healthy right-handed subjects performed repetitive (simple) or heterogeneous (complex) finger sequences using the right or left hand. Advanced planning, as evidenced by reaction time to the first key press, was greater for the complex than simple sequences and for the left than right hand. In addition to the expected greater contralateral activation in the sensorimotor cortex (SMC), greater left hemisphere activation was observed for left, relative to right, hand movements in the ipsilateral left superior parietal area and for complex, relative to simple, sequences in the left premotor and parietal cortex, left thalamus, and bilateral cerebellum. No such volumetric asymmetries were observed in the SMC. Whereas the overall MR signal intensity was greater in the left than right SMC, the extent of this asymmetry did not vary with hand or complexity level. In contrast, signal intensity in the parietal and premotor cortex was greater in the left than right hemisphere and for the complex than simple sequences. Signal intensity in the caudal anterior cerebellum was greater bilaterally for the complex than simple sequences. These findings suggest that activity in the SMC is associated with execution requirements shared by the simple and complex sequences independent of their differential cognitive requirements. In contrast, consistent with data in brain damaged patients, the left dorsal premotor and parietal areas are engaged when advanced planning is required to perform complex motor sequences that require selection of different effectors and abstract organization of the sequence, regardless of the performing hand.

We studied 16 patients with a current episode of schizophrenia, all treated with the atypical drug olanzapine, and 16 healthy subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects performed a delayed incentive paradigm with monetary rewards. During reward expectation, both, patients with schizophrenia and healthy control subjects, showed activation of the ventral striatum and midbrain in the vicinity of the ventral tegmental area. Significant categorical group differences emerged in the anterior cingulate cortex with only healthy controls showing increasing activation with increasing reward. In the patients, activation of this region was inversely correlated with positive symptoms. During outcome, both, patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls, showed activation of the ventral striatum and the mesial prefrontal cortex. Significant categorical group differences emerged in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex for the salience contrast with healthy controls showing a U-shaped activation curve, i.e., higher activation for either omission or receipt of reward compared to no reward. Our findings partially support the current concept of dopaminergic dysfunction in schizophrenia, suggesting a rather hyperactive mesolimbic dopamine system and reduced prefrontal activation, at least in partially remitted patients treated with atypical antipsychotics.

pmid_22434215,Compensatory premotor activity during affective face processing in subclinical carriers of a single mutant Parkin allele.,,"Patients with Parkinson's disease suffer from significant motor impairments and accompanying cognitive and affective dysfunction due to progressive disturbances of basal ganglia-cortical gating loops. Parkinson's disease has a long presymptomatic stage, which indicates a substantial capacity of the human brain to compensate for dopaminergic nerve degeneration before clinical manifestation of the disease. Neuroimaging studies provide evidence that increased motor-related cortical activity can compensate for progressive dopaminergic nerve degeneration in carriers of a single mutant Parkin or PINK1 gene, who show a mild but significant reduction of dopamine metabolism in the basal ganglia in the complete absence of clinical motor signs. However, it is currently unknown whether similar compensatory mechanisms are effective in non-motor basal ganglia-cortical gating loops. Here, we ask whether asymptomatic Parkin mutation carriers show altered patterns of brain activity during processing of facial gestures, and whether this might compensate for latent facial emotion recognition deficits. Current theories in social neuroscience assume that execution and perception of facial gestures are linked by a special class of visuomotor neurons ('mirror neurons') in the ventrolateral premotor cortex/pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 44/6). We hypothesized that asymptomatic Parkin mutation carriers would show increased activity in this area during processing of affective facial gestures, replicating the compensatory motor effects that have previously been observed in these individuals. Additionally, Parkin mutation carriers might show altered activity in other basal ganglia-cortical gating loops. Eight asymptomatic heterozygous Parkin mutation carriers and eight matched controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging and a subsequent facial emotion recognition task. As predicted, Parkin mutation carriers showed significantly stronger activity in the right ventrolateral premotor cortex during execution and perception of affective facial gestures than healthy controls. Furthermore, Parkin mutation carriers showed a slightly reduced ability to recognize facial emotions that was least severe in individuals who showed the strongest increase of ventrolateral premotor activity. In addition, Parkin mutation carriers showed a significantly weaker than normal increase of activity in the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex (inferior frontal gyrus pars orbitalis, Brodmann area 47), which was unrelated to facial emotion recognition ability. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that compensatory activity in the ventrolateral premotor cortex during processing of affective facial gestures can reduce impairments in facial emotion recognition in subclinical Parkin mutation carriers. A breakdown of this compensatory mechanism might lead to the impairment of facial expressivity and facial emotion recognition observed in manifest Parkinson's disease. ",
pmid_12840082,Neural basis for the processes that underlie visually guided and internally guided force control in humans.,,"Despite an intricate understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying visual and motor systems, it is not completely understood in which brain regions humans transfer visual information into motor commands. Furthermore, in the absence of visual information, the retrieval process for motor memory information remains unclear. We report an investigation where visuomotor and motor memory processes were separated from only visual and only motor activation. Subjects produced precision grip force during a functional MRI (fMRI) study that included four conditions: rest, grip force with visual feedback, grip force without visual feedback, and visual feedback only. Statistical and subtractive logic analyses segregated the functional process maps. There were three important observations. First, along with the well-established parietal and premotor cortical network, the anterior prefrontal cortex, putamen, ventral thalamus, lateral cerebellum, intermediate cerebellum, and the dentate nucleus were directly involved in the visuomotor transformation process. This activation occurred despite controlling for the visual input and motor output. Second, a detailed topographic orientation of visuomotor to motor/sensory activity was mapped for the premotor cortex, parietal cortex, and the cerebellum. Third, the retrieval of motor memory information was isolated in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, ventral prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate. The motor memory process did not extend to the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the basal ganglia. These findings provide evidence in humans for a model where a distributed network extends over cortical and subcortical regions to control the visuomotor transformation process used during visually guided tasks. In contrast, a localized network in the prefrontal cortex retrieves force output from memory during internally guided actions. ",

Sensorimotor network","Migraine is a common recurrent neurological disorder combining nausea, vomiting, and hypersensitivities to visual, auditory, olfactory and somatosensory stimuli. However, the dysfunction of the sensorimotor network in migraineurs has not been well clarified. In the present study, we evaluated the dysfunction of the sensorimotor network in 30 migraineurs without aura and in 31 controls by combining regional homogeneity (ReHo), amplitudes of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and degree centrality (DC) analysis methods based on resting-state fMRI. A seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis was used to investigate whether the dysfunctional areas within the sensorimotor network exhibited abnormal FC with other brain areas. Compared to the controls, the migraineurs without aura exhibited significantly smaller ReHo, ALFF and DC values in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and right premotor cortex (PMC). The migraineurs showed weaker FC between the S1 and brain areas within the pain intensity and spatial discrimination pathways and trigemino-thalamo-cortical nociceptive pathway. We proposed that the dysfunction of the S1 and PMC and the decreased FC between the S1 and brain areas in migraineurs without aura may disrupt the discrimination of sensory features of pain and affect nociception pathways, and would be involved in the dysfunctional mechanism in migraine.

The present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study examines brain activities of proposers that contribute to fair and unfair behaviors. We hypothesized that egoistic and altruistic motives of proposers affect fairness differentially in the two games. fMRI analysis revealed that the 28% of fair offers in the present ultimatum game were related to enhanced activity in prefrontal areas, in particular, in regions involved in reward and theory of mind. This corroborates the idea that egoistic motives are primarily responsible for fair offers in this game, which we denote as strategic fairness. Fair offers in the dictator game, however, were related to increased activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex. This supports the idea that altruistic motives primarily drive fair offers in the dictator game, denoted here as altruistic fairness. ",

reappraisal","The use of top-down cognitive control mechanisms to regulate emotional responses as circumstances change is critical for mental and physical health. Several theoretical models of emotion regulation have been postulated; it remains unclear, however, in which brain regions emotion regulation goals (e.g., the downregulation of fear) are represented. Here, we examined the neural mechanisms of regulating emotion using fMRI and identified brain regions representing reappraisal goals. Using a multimethodological analysis approach, combining standard activation-based and pattern-information analyses, we identified a distributed network of lateral frontal, temporal, and parietal regions implicated in reappraisal and within it, a core system that represents reappraisal goals in an abstract, stimulus-independent fashion. Within this core system, the neural pattern-separability in a subset of regions including the left inferior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and inferior parietal lobe was related to the success in emotion regulation. Those brain regions might link the prefrontal control regions with the subcortical affective regions. Given the strong association of this subsystem with inner speech functions and semantic memory, we conclude that those cognitive mechanisms may be used for orchestrating emotion regulation.

We examined the ability of estradiol to modulate the manipulation of information in working memory and related brain activation in postmenopausal women. Twenty healthy postmenopausal women (mean age (SD)=59.13 (5.5)) were randomly assigned to three months of 1mg oral 17-β estradiol or placebo. At baseline and three months later each woman completed a visual verbal N-back sequential letter test of working memory during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The fMRI data showed that women who were treated with estradiol for three months had increased frontal activation during the more difficult working memory load conditions compared to women treated with placebo. Performance on the verbal working memory task showed no difference between estradiol and placebo treated subjects. These data are consistent with prior work showing increases in frontal activation on memory tasks after estrogen treatment. However, this is the first study to show that estrogen-induced increases in brain activity were tied to cognitive load during a verbal working memory task. These data suggest that estradiol treatment effects on cognition may be in part produced through modulation of frontal lobe functioning under difficult task conditions. ",

Migraine without aura
Neuroimaging","Migraine without aura (MWoA) is a major neurological disorder with unsatisfactory adherence to current medications. Acupuncture has emerged as a promising method for treating MWoA. However, the brain mechanism underlying acupuncture is yet unclear. The present study aimed to examine the effects of acupuncture in regulating brain connectivity of the key regions in pain modulation. In this study, MWoA patients were recruited and randomly assigned to 4 weeks of real or sham acupuncture. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected before and after the treatment. A modern neuroimaging literature meta-analysis of 515 fMRI studies was conducted to identify pain modulation-related key regions as regions of interest (ROIs). Seed-to-voxel resting state-functional connectivity (rsFC) method and repeated-measures two-way analysis of variance were conducted to determine the interaction effects between the two groups and time (baseline and post-treatment). The changes in rsFC were evaluated between baseline and post-treatment in real and sham acupuncture groups, respectively. Clinical data at baseline and post-treatment were also recorded in order to determine between-group differences in clinical outcomes as well as correlations between rsFC changes and clinical effects. 40 subjects were involved in the final analysis. The current study demonstrated significant improvement in real acupuncture vs sham acupuncture on headache severity (monthly migraine days), headache impact (6-item Headache Impact Test), and health-related quality of life (Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire). Five pain modulation-related key regions, including the right amygdala (AMYG), left insula (INS), left medial orbital superior frontal gyrus (PFCventmed), left middle occipital gyrus (MOG), and right middle cingulate cortex (MCC), were selected based on the meta-analysis on brain imaging studies. This study found that 1) after acupuncture treatment, migraine patients of the real acupuncture group showed significantly enhanced connectivity in the right AMYG/MCC-left MTG and the right MCC-right superior temporal gyrus (STG) compared to that of the sham acupuncture group; 2) negative correlations were established between clinical effects and increased rsFC in the right AMYG/MCC-left MTG; 3) baseline right AMYG-left MTG rsFC predicts monthly migraine days reduction after treatment. The current results suggested that acupuncture may concurrently regulate the rsFC of two pain modulation regions in the AMYG and MCC. MTG and STG may be the key nodes linked to multisensory processing of pain modulation in migraine with acupuncture treatment. These findings highlighted the potential of acupuncture for migraine management and the mechanisms underlying the modulation effects. ",
pmid_23474094,Resting-state brain activity in major depressive disorder patients and their siblings.,,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly heritable psychiatric disease, and the existing literature is not robust enough to allow us to evaluate whether MDD-associated biomarkers are state-independent heritable endophenotypes or state markers related to depression per se. Twenty two patients diagnosed with MDD, 22 siblings, as well as 26 gender-, age-, and education-matched healthy subjects, participated in the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis. We compared the differences in the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) among the three groups and investigated the correlation between clinical measurements and fALFF in the regions displaying significant group differences. Both the MDD and siblings groups showed an increased fALFF in the left middle frontal gyrus (l-MFG, Brodmann Area, BA 10) compared to the healthy controls. The MDD groups demonstrated an increased fALFF in the right dorsal medial frontal gyrus (r-DMFG, BA 9) and a decreased fALFF in the bilateral lingual gyrus relative to siblings and healthy controls. Medication effects, an inability to control subjects' thoughts during imaging. Our results suggest that the dysfunction in the l-MFG may represent an imaging endophenotype which may indicate a risk for MDD. The r-DMFG may play a critical role in depressive symptomatology and may reveal therapeutic target for MDD. ",
pmid_16932146,Dissociated roles of the middle frontal gyri in the processing of Chinese characters.,,"The present study examined a hypothesis that the right middle frontal gyrus participates in processing orthography of Chinese characters, while the left middle frontal gyrus mediates access to phonology and semantics. Brain activation during three character tasks, which required processing orthography, phonology, or semantics of Chinese characters, respectively, was measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Comparable neural activity in the right middle frontal gyrus was observed in all three character tasks that always demand orthographical processing. In contrast, the left middle frontal gyrus showed greater activation in the phonological and semantic tasks than in the orthographic task. These results suggest that the right and left middle frontal gyrus have dissociable functions in achieving Chinese character recognition. ",
pmid_16735472,Limbic hyperactivation during processing of neutral facial expressions in children with bipolar disorder.,,"Reflecting a paradigm shift in clinical neuroscience, many chronic psychiatric illnesses are now hypothesized to result from perturbed neural development. However, most work in this area focuses on schizophrenia. Here, we extend this paradigm to pediatric bipolar disorder (BD), thus demonstrating traction in the developmental psychobiology perspective. To study amygdala dysfunction, we examined neural mechanisms mediating face processing in 22 youths (mean age 14.21 +/- 3.11 yr) with BD and 21 controls of comparable age, gender, and IQ. Event-related functional MRI compared neural activation when attention was directed to emotional aspects of faces (hostility, subjects' fearfulness) vs. nonemotional aspects (nose width). Compared with controls, patients perceived greater hostility in neutral faces and reported more fear when viewing them. Also, compared with controls, patients had greater activation in the left amygdala, accumbens, putamen, and ventral prefrontal cortex when rating face hostility, and greater activation in the left amygdala and bilateral accumbens when rating their fear of the face. There were no between-group behavioral or neural differences in the nonemotional conditions. Results implicate deficient emotion-attention interactions in the pathophysiology of BD in youth and suggest that developmental psychobiology approaches to chronic mental illness have broad applicability.

pmid_35228741,Impaired insulin signalling and allostatic load in Alzheimer disease.,,"The discovery of insulin in 1921 revolutionized the treatment of diabetes and paved the way for numerous studies on hormone signalling networks and actions in peripheral tissues and in the central nervous system. Impaired insulin signalling, a hallmark of diabetes, is now established as a key component of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology. Here, we review evidence showing that brain inflammation and activation of cellular stress response mechanisms comprise molecular underpinnings of impaired brain insulin signalling in AD and integrate impaired insulin signalling with AD pathology. Further, we highlight that insulin resistance is an important component of allostatic load and that allostatic overload can trigger insulin resistance. This bidirectional association between impaired insulin signalling and allostatic overload favours medical conditions that increase the risk of AD, including diabetes, obesity, depression, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Finally, we discuss how the integration of biological, social and lifestyle factors throughout the lifespan can contribute to the development of AD, underscoring the potential of social and lifestyle interventions to preserve brain health and prevent or delay AD.

pmid_21782960,Goal-independent mechanisms for free response generation: creative and pseudo-random performance share neural substrates.,,"To what extent free response generation in different tasks uses common and task-specific neurocognitive processes has remained unclear. Here, we investigated overlap and differences in neural activity during musical improvisation and pseudo-random response generation. Brain activity was measured using fMRI in a group of professional classical pianists, who performed musical improvisation of melodies, pseudo-random key-presses and a baseline condition (sight-reading), on either two, six or twelve keys on a piano keyboard. The results revealed an extensive overlap in neural activity between the two generative conditions. Active regions included the dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortices, inferior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex and pre-SMA. No regions showed higher activity in improvisation than in pseudo-random generation. These findings suggest that the activated regions fulfill generic functions that are utilized in different types of free generation tasks, independent of overall goal. In contrast, pseudo-random generation was accompanied by higher activity than improvisation in several regions. This presumably reflects the participants' musical expertise as well as the pseudo-random generation task's high load on attention, working memory, and executive control. The results highlight the significance of using naturalistic tasks to study human behavior and cognition. No brain activity was related to the size of the response set. We discuss that this may reflect that the musicians were able to use specific strategies for improvisation, by which there was no simple relationship between response set size and neural activity.

functional connectivity","Internet gaming disorder (IGD) is a behavioral addiction involving excessive online game use despite negative psychosocial consequences. Unrestricted online gaming may lead to changes in striatal activity and the relationship between the striatum and other cortical regions. This study investigated structural and functional abnormalities involving the striatum through longitudinal follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessments. Eighteen young males with IGD (mean age: 23.8 ± 2.0 years) and 18 controls (mean age: 23.9 ± 2.7 years) were evaluated. Subjects were reassessed ≥1 year after the first visit (mean follow-up duration: 22.8 ± 6.7 months), using voxel-based morphometry and seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (FC) analyses in seed regions of the dorsal and ventral striatum. Subjects with IGD had smaller gray matter volume (GMV) in the anterior/middle cingulate cortex compared with controls during initial and follow-up assessments. They exhibited decreased FC between the left dorsal putamen and left medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) compared with controls. They exhibited increased FC strength between the right dorsal putamen and right middle occipital gyrus (MOG) during follow-up. Subjects with IGD showed a significant correlation between changes in the dorsal putamen-MOG FC and gaming time per day. Young males with IGD showed an altered FC pattern in the dorsal striatum during follow-up. FC of the dorsal striatum in IGD increased in the mPFC and decreased in the MOG. These findings showed that IGD was accompanied by weakening of prefrontal control and strengthening of the sensorimotor network, suggesting that uncontrolled gaming may be related with functional neural changes in the dorsal striatum.

pmid_15204056,Neural substrates associated with the concurrent performance of dual working memory tasks.,,"The neural substrates of the dual working memory (WM) process were investigated using concurrent performance of auditory and visual n-back WM tasks. Based on the pre-fMRI behavioral testing, a lettered 1-back WM paradigm was implemented for an fMRI examination of healthy volunteers who performed (1) auditory, (2) visual, and (3) simultaneous visual and auditory WM tasks. The behavioral performance, as measured by the reaction time, was deteriorated in the dual task condition compared to the single task condition. Group analysis of the fMRI data revealed that the majority of activation identified during each component task was concurrently activated in the dual task condition. However, several neural substrates such as left middle frontal gyrus, left superior parietal lobule, posterior aspect of right inferior temporal gyrus, and bilateral parahippocampal gyri were selectively activated during the dual WM task. These data suggest that new neural networks come into play to assist in the greater load placed on the WM with the incongruent stimulation modality, which may also have implications in crossmodal integrative processes.

However, these studies have been limited in their ability to distinguish substance use risk factors from cannabis-induced effects on neurocognition. We used a prospective cohort design to test whether neurocognitive differences preceded cannabis onset (substance use risk model) and if early cannabis use was associated with poorer neurocognitive development (cannabis exposure model). Participants (N = 85) completed a visuospatial working memory task during functional magnetic resonance imaging and multiple cognitive assessments (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV, Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery) at 12 years of age, before any reported cannabis use (baseline), and at 15 years of age (follow-up: N = 85 cognitive assessments, n = 67 neuroimaging). By follow-up, 22 participants reported using cannabis and/or failed a Δ At baseline, group differences supported a risk model. Those who would initiate cannabis use by 15 years of age had activation differences in frontoparietal (increased) and visual association (decreased) regions and poorer executive planning scores (Stockings of Cambridge) compared with noninitiators. Limited support was found for a cannabis exposure model. At follow-up, activation in the cuneus displayed a significant cannabis dose-response relationship, although neither cannabis dose nor cuneus activation was associated with cognitive performance. The purported neurocognitive effects of early cannabis onset may not be due to cannabis initiation alone but also driven by limitations or late development of neurocognitive systems predictive of substance use. In addition, more prolonged cannabis exposure may be required to observe the cognitive effects of early cannabis onset. ",

fMRI","There is a growing interest in the use of functional imaging to assess brain activity in the absence of behavioural responses in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC). In the present study, we applied a hierarchical auditory stimulation paradigm to functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) in a group of long-term DOC adult patients. Brain response to pairs of pseudowords, of unrelated words and of semantically related words, i.e. stimuli differing in lexical status (words vs. pseudowords) and semantic relatedness (related vs. unrelated) was assessed. The former contrast was considered to reflect the automatic brain response to the passive presentation of meaningful real words, while the latter aimed to assess the response to meaning relationships. The results of the study indicate that automatic lexical processing can be observed in minimally conscious state (MCS), but also in vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS) patients, as indicated by increase in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activity in the linguistic networks. DOC patients, for some task conditions, recruited additional areas in comparison to healthy participants. Furthermore this study provides additional evidence of the potential role of fMRI in the assessment of residual cognitive processing in some of these patients, which may not be evident at the clinical level.

We explored RS FC of large-scale brain networks in pediatric-migraine patients and their correlation with patients' clinical characteristics. RS functional MRI data was acquired from 13 pediatric-migraine patients and 14 age- and sex-matched controls. Intra- and inter-network RS FC differences between patients and controls were evaluated. Correlations between RS FC abnormalities and patients' clinical characteristics were also assessed. Compared to controls, pediatric-migraine patients had a decreased RS FC of the left parieto-occipital junction of the default mode network (DMN) and left-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of the executive control network (ECN). They also experienced an increased RS FC of the right frontopolar cortex of the right frontoparietal network (FPN) and the right-middle occipital gyrus of the secondary visual network. A significant stronger connectivity between the ECN and primary visual network and between the right FPN and primary sensorimotor, primary visual and auditory networks were found in migraine patients compared to controls. A significant weaker connectivity between the DMN and right FPN was revealed in migraineurs compared to controls. No correlation was found between intra- and inter-network RS FC abnormalities and patients' clinical characteristics. Pediatric-migraine patients harbor significant RS FC abnormalities in brain networks involved in multisensory processing and in the cognitive control of pain. An early dysregulation of multisensory processing, including pain, might represent a phenotypic biomarker of the disease. ",
pmid_19449332,Genetic variation in neuregulin1 is associated with differences in prefrontal engagement in children.,,"The majority of psychopathology is rooted early in life and first emerges during childhood and adolescence. However, little is known about how risk genes affect brain function to increase biological vulnerability to psychopathology in childhood, because most imaging genetic studies published so far have been conducted on adult participants. We examined the impact of neuregulin1 (NRG1), a probable susceptibility gene for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, on brain function in a sample of 102 ten- to twelve-year-old children. Each participant performed a Go/Nogo task, whereas brain responses were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Statistical parametric mapping was used to estimate the impact of genetic variation in NRG1 on brain activation. Response accuracy and reaction times did not differ as a function of NRG1 genotype. However, individuals with the high-risk variant expressed greater brain activation for both Go and Nogo stimuli in the right posterior orbital gyrus, where NRG1 genotype accounted for 11% of interindividual variance. There were no regions showing a significant interaction between NRG1 genotype and stimulus type even at trend level, suggesting that the impact of NRG1 on brain activation was not specific to either response inhibition or motor execution. These results suggest that that genetic variation in NRG1 is associated with different levels of prefrontal engagement in children as young as 10-12 years of age. Our investigation provides support to the idea that genetic factors may affect brain function to moderate vulnerability to psychopathology from childhood. ",

pmid_11251124,Dyslexia: cultural diversity and biological unity.,,"The recognition of dyslexia as a neurodevelopmental disorder has been hampered by the belief that it is not a specific diagnostic entity because it has variable and culture-specific manifestations. In line with this belief, we found that Italian dyslexics, using a shallow orthography which facilitates reading, performed better on reading tasks than did English and French dyslexics. However, all dyslexics were equally impaired relative to their controls on reading and phonological tasks. Positron emission tomography scans during explicit and implicit reading showed the same reduced activity in a region of the left hemisphere in dyslexics from all three countries, with the maximum peak in the middle temporal gyrus and additional peaks in the inferior and superior temporal gyri and middle occipital gyrus. We conclude that there is a universal neurocognitive basis for dyslexia and that differences in reading performance among dyslexics of different countries are due to different orthographies. ",

Behavioral data suggest that AAS influences mentalizing proficiency, i.e. the ability to predict and explain people's behavior with reference to mental states, but the neural correlates are unknown. We here tested how the AAS dimensions ""avoidance"" (AV) and ""anxiety"" (ANX) modulate neural correlates of mentalizing. We measured brain activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 164 healthy subjects during an interactive mentalizing paradigm (Prisoner's Dilemma Game). AAS was assessed with the Relationship Scales Questionnaire, including the subscales AV and ANX. Our task elicited a strong activation of the mentalizing network, including bilateral precuneus, (anterior, middle, and posterior) cingulate cortices, temporal poles, inferior frontal gyri (IFG), temporoparietal junctions, superior medial frontal gyri as well as right medial orbital frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and amygdala. We found that AV is positively and ANX negatively correlated with task-associated neural activity in the right amygdala, MFG, midcingulate cortex, and superior parietal lobule, and in bilateral IFG. These data suggest that avoidantly attached adults activate brain areas implicated in emotion regulation and cognitive control to a larger extent than anxiously attached individuals during mentalizing.

pmid_23869578,Processing of subliminal facial expressions of emotion: a behavioral and fMRI study.,,"The recognition of emotional facial expressions is an important means to adjust behavior in social interactions. As facial expressions widely differ in their duration and degree of expressiveness, they often manifest with short and transient expressions below the level of awareness. In this combined behavioral and fMRI study, we aimed at examining whether or not consciously accessible (subliminal) emotional facial expressions influence empathic judgments and which brain activations are related to it. We hypothesized that subliminal facial expressions of emotions masked with neutral expressions of the same faces induce an empathic processing similar to consciously accessible (supraliminal) facial expressions. Our behavioral data in 23 healthy subjects showed that subliminal emotional facial expressions of 40 ms duration affect the judgments of the subsequent neutral facial expressions. In the fMRI study in 12 healthy subjects it was found that both, supra- and subliminal emotional facial expressions shared a widespread network of brain areas including the fusiform gyrus, the temporo-parietal junction, and the inferior, dorsolateral, and medial frontal cortex. Compared with subliminal facial expressions, supraliminal facial expressions led to a greater activation of left occipital and fusiform face areas. We conclude that masked subliminal emotional information is suited to trigger processing in brain areas which have been implicated in empathy and, thereby in social encounters. ",

subjective cognitive decline","Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (naMCI), and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are regarded to be at high risk of converting to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) can reflect functional deterioration while diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is capable of detecting white matter integrity. Our study aimed to investigate the structural and functional alterations to further reveal convergence and divergence among SCD, naMCI, and aMCI and how these contribute to cognitive deterioration. We analyzed ALFF under slow-4 (0.027-0.073 Hz) and slow-5 (0.01-0.027 Hz) bands and white matter fiber integrity among normal controls (CN), SCD, naMCI, and aMCI groups. Correlation analyses were further utilized among paired DTI alteration, ALFF deterioration, and cognitive decline. For ALFF calculation, ascended ALFF values were detected in the lingual gyrus (LING) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG) within SCD and naMCI patients, respectively. Descended ALFF values were presented mainly in the LING, SFG, middle frontal gyrus, and precuneus in aMCI patients compared to CN, SCD, and naMCI groups. For DTI analyses, white matter alterations were detected within the uncinate fasciculus (UF) in aMCI patients and within the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) in naMCI patients. SCD patients presented alterations in both fasciculi. Correlation analyses revealed that the majority of these structural and functional alterations were associated with complicated cognitive decline. Besides, UF alterations were correlated with ALFF deterioration in the SFG within aMCI patients. SCD shares structurally and functionally deteriorative characteristics with aMCI and naMCI, and tends to convert to either of them. Furthermore, abnormalities in white matter fibers may be the structural basis of abnormal brain activation in preclinical AD stages. Combined together, it suggests that structural and functional integration may characterize the preclinical AD progression. ",

Brain imaging studies on visuospatial WM in alcohol-dependent patients compared to controls indicate that information processing requires compensatory increased neural activation to perform at a normal level. However, to date, no study tested whether such increased neural WM activation patterns or the lack thereof predict relapse behavior in alcohol-dependent individuals, and whether such differences persist when adequately correcting for individual grey matter differences. We combined analyses of neural activation during an n-back task and local grey matter volumes using Biological Parametric Mapping in 40 detoxified alcohol-dependent patients and 40 matched healthy controls (HC), and assessed prospective relapse risk during a 7-month follow-up period. Despite equal task performance, we found increased functional activation during high versus low cognitive WM load (2-back-0-back) in bilateral rostral prefrontal cortex (BA10) and bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (BA45,47) in prospective abstainers versus relapsers, and further in left/right lateral/medial premotor cortex (BA6,8) in abstainers versus HC. In prospective abstainers, but not relapsers, subtle cognitive impairment was associated with increased neural task activity in the premotor cortex. These findings suggest that in prospective abstainers, higher functional engagement of presumably less impaired neural resources in executive behavioral control brain areas (BA10, 45, 47, 6, 8) may constitute a resilience factor associated with good treatment outcome.

pmid_27575491,Alterations in Brain Structure and Functional Connectivity in Alcohol Dependent Patients and Possible Association with Impulsivity.,,"Previous studies have documented that heightened impulsivity likely contributes to the development and maintenance of alcohol use disorders. However, there is still a lack of studies that comprehensively detected the brain changes associated with abnormal impulsivity in alcohol addicts. This study was designed to investigate the alterations in brain structure and functional connectivity associated with abnormal impulsivity in alcohol dependent patients. Brain structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging data as well as impulsive behavior data were collected from 20 alcohol dependent patients and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls respectively. Voxel-based morphometry was used to investigate the differences of grey matter volume, and tract-based spatial statistics was used to detect abnormal white matter regions between alcohol dependent patients and healthy controls. The alterations in resting-state functional connectivity in alcohol dependent patients were examined using selected brain areas with gray matter deficits as seed regions. Compared with healthy controls, alcohol dependent patients had significantly reduced gray matter volume in the mesocorticolimbic system including the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, the medial prefrontal cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex and the putamen, decreased fractional anisotropy in the regions connecting the damaged grey matter areas driven by higher radial diffusivity value in the same areas and decreased resting-state functional connectivity within the reward network. Moreover, the gray matter volume of the left medial prefrontal cortex exhibited negative correlations with various impulse indices. These findings suggest that chronic alcohol dependence could cause a complex neural changes linked to abnormal impulsivity. ",
pmid_15670692,Seeing John Malkovich: the neural substrates of person categorization.,,"Neuroimaging data have implicated regions of the ventral temporal cortex (e.g., fusiform gyrus) as functionally important in face recognition. Recent evidence, however, suggests that these regions are not face-specific, but rather reflect subordinate-level categorical processing underpinned by perceptual expertise. Moreover, when people possess expertise for a particular class of stimuli (e.g., faces), subordinate-level identification is thought to be an automatic process. To investigate the neural substrates of person construal, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to contrast brain activity while participants judged faces at different levels of semantic specificity (i.e., identity vs. occupation). The results revealed that participants were quicker to access identity than occupational knowledge. In addition, greater activity was observed in bilateral regions of the fusiform gyrus on identity than occupation trials. Taken together, these findings support the viewpoint that person construal is characterized by the ability to access subordinate-level semantic information about people, a capacity that is underpinned by neural activity in discrete regions of the ventral temporal cortex.

pmid_23326294,Partly Separated Activations in the Spatial Distribution between de-qi and Sharp Pain during Acupuncture Stimulation: An fMRI-Based Study.,,"Nowadays, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become one of the most important ways to explore the central mechanism of acupuncture. Among these studies, activations around the somatosensory-related brain network had the most robust blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses. However, due to the insufficient control of the subjective sensations during acupuncture stimulation, whether these robust activations reflected the pattern of de-qi, sharp pain, or mixed (de-qi + sharp pain) sensations was largely unknown. The current study recruited 50 subjects and grouped them into two groups according to whether he/she experienced sharp pain during acupuncture stimulation to give a definite answer to the aforesaid question. Our results indicated that BOLD responses associated with de-qi during acupuncture stimulation at ST36 were activation dominated. Furthermore, both the quantitative and qualitative differences of BOLD responses between de-qi and mixed sensations evoked by acupuncture stimulation were significant. The pattern of BOLD responses of sharp pain might be partly separated from that of de-qi in the spatial distribution. Therefore, we proposed that in order to explore the specific central mechanism of acupuncture, subjects with sharp pain should be excluded from those with only de-qi. ",

The distinct brain responses to biological motion exhibited by TD children and US are striking given the identical behavioral profile of these two groups. These findings offer far-reaching implications for our understanding of the neural systems underlying autism. ",

A ""default network"" of spontaneous low-frequency fluctuations has been described in healthy volunteers during stimulus-independent thought. Negatively correlated with this network are regions activated during attention-demanding tasks. Both these networks involve brain regions and functions that have been linked with schizophrenia in previous research. The present study examined spontaneous slow fluctuations in the BOLD signal at rest, as measured by correlation with low-frequency oscillations in the posterior cingulate, in 17 schizophrenic patients, and 17 comparable healthy volunteers. Healthy volunteers demonstrated correlation between spontaneous low-frequency fluctuations of the BOLD signal in the posterior cingulate and fluctuations in the lateral parietal, medial prefrontal, and cerebellar regions, similar to previous reports. Schizophrenic patients had significantly less correlation between spontaneous slow activity in the posterior cingulate and that in the lateral parietal, medial prefrontal, and cerebellar regions. Connectivity of the posterior cingulate was found to vary with both positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenic patients. Because these data suggest significant abnormalities in resting-state neural networks in schizophrenia, further investigations of spontaneous slow fluctuations of the BOLD signal seem warranted in this population.

pmid_16488547,Hormone therapy and cognitive function: is there a critical period for benefit?,,"The large majority of women receiving hormone therapy initiate therapy early in life for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. However, the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study, the only randomized clinical trial to date on hormone therapy and dementia, was carried out in women age 65 and older. That trial provided important insights into the detrimental effects of hormone therapy on dementia in women initiating later in life. The generalizability of those findings to the typical hormone therapy user who initiates earlier in life is unknown. To address this important issue, this review focuses on observational trials of hormone therapy and dementia risk, randomized clinical trials of hormone therapy and cognitive function, and basic science studies. These lines of research provide suggestive, but not definitive, evidence that early initiation of hormone therapy may provide cognitive benefits, particularly to verbal memory and other hippocampally mediated functions. Other forms of hormone therapy, other cognitive domains, and cyclic hormone regimens may not conform to this ""critical period hypothesis.""

Stress
Working memory","Affective hyper-reactivity and impaired cognitive control of emotional material are core features of borderline personality disorder (BPD). A high percentage of individuals with BPD experience stress-related dissociation, including emotional numbing and memory disruptions. So far little is known about how dissociation influences the neural processing of emotional material in the context of a working memory task in BPD. We aimed to investigate whole-brain activity and amygdala functional connectivity (FC) during an Emotional Working Memory Task (EWMT) after dissociation induction in un-medicated BPD patients compared to healthy controls (HC). Using script-driven imagery, dissociation was induced in 17 patients ('BPD_D'), while 12 patients ('BPD_N') and 18 HC were exposed to neutral scripts during fMRI. Afterwards, participants performed the EWMT with neutral vs. negative IAPS pictures vs. no distractors. Main outcome measures were behavioral performance (reaction times, errors) and whole-brain activity during the EWMT. Psychophysiological interaction analysis was used to examine amygdala connectivity during emotional distraction. BPD patients after dissociation induction showed overall WM impairments, a deactivation in bilateral amygdala, and lower activity in left cuneus, lingual gyrus, and posterior cingulate than BPD_N, along with stronger left inferior frontal gyrus activity than HC. Furthermore, reduced amygdala FC with fusiform gyrus and stronger amygdala FC with right middle/superior temporal gyrus and left inferior parietal lobule was observed in BPD_D. Findings suggest that dissociation affects reactivity to emotionally salient material and WM. Altered activity in areas associated with emotion processing, memory, and self-referential processes may contribute to dissociative states in BPD. ",
pmid_12915252,Relations between brain network activation and analgesic effect induced by low vs. high frequency electrical acupoint stimulation in different subjects: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study.,,"Two- or 100-Hz electrical acupoint stimulation (EAS) can induce analgesia via distinct central mechanisms. It has long been known that the extent of EAS analgesia showed tremendous difference among subjects. Functional MRI (fMRI) studies were performed to allocate the possible mechanisms underlying the frequency specificity as well as individual variability of EAS analgesia. In either frequencies, the averaged fMRI activation levels of bilateral secondary somatosensory area and insula, contralateral anterior cingulate cortex and thalamus were positively correlated with the EAS-induced analgesic effect across the subjects. In 2-Hz EAS group, positive correlations were observed in contralateral primary motor area, supplementary motor area, and ipsilateral superior temporal gyrus, while negative correlations were found in bilateral hippocampus. In 100-Hz EAS group, positive correlations were observed in contralateral inferior parietal lobule, ipsilateral anterior cingulate cortex, nucleus accumbens, and pons, while negative correlation was detected in contralateral amygdala. These results suggest that functional activities of certain brain areas might be correlated with the effect of EAS-induced analgesia, in a frequency-dependent dynamic. EAS-induced analgesia with low and high frequencies seems to be mediated by different, though overlapped, brain networks. The differential activations/de-activations in brain networks across subjects may provide a neurobiological explanation for the mechanisms of the induction and the individual variability of analgesic effect induced by EAS, or that of manual acupuncture as well.

We used a human functional neuroimaging approach to ask how affect-, value-, and regulation-related brain systems interact to predict effects of graphic anti-smoking messages for individual smokers (both males and females) and within a population-level messaging campaign. Results indicated that increased activity in the amygdala, a region involved in affective reactivity, predicted both personal quit intentions and population-level information-seeking and this was mediated by activity in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a region involved in computing an integrative value signal. Further, the predictive value of these regions was moderated by expression of a meta-analytically defined brain pattern indexing emotion regulation. That is, amygdala and vmPFC activity strongly tracked with population behavior only when participants showed low recruitment of this brain pattern, which consists of regions involved in goal-driven regulation of affective responses. Overall, these findings suggest that affective and value-related brain responses can predict the success of persuasive messages and that neural mechanisms of emotion regulation can shape these responses, moderating the extent to which they track with population-level message impact.

pmid_22939367,Altered functional connectivity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in first-episode patients with major depressive disorder.,,"The aim of this study was to investigate resting-state functional connectivity alteration of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in patients with first-episode major depressive disorder (MDD). Twenty-two first-episode MDD patients and thirty age-, gender- and education-matched healthy control subjects were enrolled. Rest state functional magnetic resonance images and structure magnetic resonance images were scanned. The functional connectivity analysis was done based on the result of voxel-based morphometry (VBM). And the right DLPFC was chosen as the seed region of interests (ROI), as its gray matter density (GMD) decreased in the MDD patients compared with controls and its GMD values were negative correlation with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores. Compared to healthy controls, the MDD patients showed increased functional connectivity with right the DLPFC in the left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), left parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), thalamus and precentral gyrus. In contrast, there were decreased functional connectivity between the right DLPFC and right parietal lobe. By applying the VBM results to the functional connectivity analysis, the study suggested that abnormality of GMD in right DLPFC might be related to the functional connectivity alteration in the pathophysiology of MDD, which might be useful in further characterizing structure-function relations in this disorder.

A total of 22 patients with schizophrenia and 22 age-matched healthy controls participated. Magnetic resonance image data were processed using SPM8 software with diffeomorphic anatomical registration via an exponentiated Lie algebra (DARTEL) algorithm. Patients with schizophrenia exhibited significantly decreased GM volumes of the insula, superior temporal gyrus (STG), gyrus rectus, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) compared with healthy controls. The GM volumes of the STG and gyrus rectus were negatively correlated with the positive scales on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and those of the STG and ACC were negatively correlated with the negative scales. The durations of illness in schizophrenia were negatively correlated with the GM volumes of the insula, STG, and ACC. Patients with schizophrenia exhibited significantly decreased WM volumes of the superior frontal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, and STG. The WM volumes of the STG were negatively correlated with the duration of illness. Our findings suggest that GM and WM volume abnormalities in the STG are associated with the psychopathology of schizophrenia. ",
pmid_16432232,Cortical signatures of noun and verb production.,,"Categories like ""noun"" and ""verb"" represent the basic units of grammar in all human languages, and the retrieval of categorical information associated with words is an essential step in the production of grammatical speech. Studies of brain-damaged patients suggest that knowledge of nouns and verbs can be spared or impaired selectively; however, the neuroanatomical correlates of this dissociation are not well understood. We used event-related functional MRI to identify cortical regions that were active when English-speaking subjects produced nouns or verbs in the context of short phrases. Two regions, in the left prefrontal cortex and left superior parietal lobule, were selectively activated for verb trials compared with noun trials; one region in the left inferior temporal lobe was more active during noun production than verb production. We propose that these regions are involved in representing core conceptual properties of nouns and verbs. ",
pmid_17360506,Functional and morphometric brain dissociation between dyslexia and reading ability.,,"In functional neuroimaging studies, individuals with dyslexia frequently exhibit both hypoactivation, often in the left parietotemporal cortex, and hyperactivation, often in the left inferior frontal cortex, but there has been no evidence to suggest how to interpret the differential relations of hypoactivation and hyperactivation to dyslexia. To address this question, we measured brain activation by functional MRI during visual word rhyme judgment compared with visual cross-hair fixation rest, and we measured gray matter morphology by voxel-based morphometry in dyslexic adolescents in comparison with (i) an age-matched group, and (ii) a reading-matched group younger than the dyslexic group but equal to the dyslexic group in reading performance. Relative to the age-matched group (n = 19; mean 14.4 years), the dyslexic group (n = 19; mean 14.4 years) exhibited hypoactivation in left parietal and bilateral fusiform cortices and hyperactivation in left inferior and middle frontal gyri, caudate, and thalamus. Relative to the reading-matched group (n = 12; mean 9.8 years), the dyslexic group (n = 12; mean 14.5 years) also exhibited hypoactivation in left parietal and fusiform regions but equal activation in all four areas that had exhibited hyperactivation relative to age-matched controls as well. In regions that exhibited atypical activation in the dyslexic group, only the left parietal region exhibited reduced gray matter volume relative to both control groups. Thus, areas of hyperactivation in dyslexia reflected processes related to the level of current reading ability independent of dyslexia. In contrast, areas of hypoactivation in dyslexia reflected functional atypicalities related to dyslexia itself, independent of current reading ability, and related to atypical brain morphology in dyslexia. ",
pmid_7731972,Distinct neural correlates of visual long-term memory for spatial location and object identity: a positron emission tomography study in humans.,,"The purpose of the present study was to investigate by using positron emission tomography (PET) whether the cortical pathways that are involved in visual perception of spatial location and object identity are also differentially implicated in retrieval of these types of information from episodic long-term memory. Subjects studied a set of displays consisting of three unique representational line drawings arranged in different spatial configurations. Later, while undergoing PET scanning, subjects' memory for spatial location and identity of the objects in the displays was tested and compared to a perceptual baseline task involving the same displays. In comparison to the baseline task, each of the memory tasks activated both the dorsal and the ventral pathways in the right hemisphere but not to an equal extent. There was also activation of the right prefrontal cortex. When PET scans of the memory tasks were compared to each other, areas of activation were very circumscribed and restricted to the right hemisphere: For retrieval of object identity, the area was in the inferior temporal cortex in the region of the fusiform gyrus (area 37), whereas for retrieval of spatial location, it was in the inferior parietal lobule in the region of the supramarginal gyrus (area 40). Thus, our study shows that distinct neural pathways are activated during retrieval of information about spatial location and object identity from long-term memory. ",
pmid_21390505,Fronto-limbic dysfunction in mania pre-treatment and persistent amygdala over-activity post-treatment in pediatric bipolar disorder.,,"Neural deficits at the interface of affect and cognition may improve with pharmacotherapy in pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD). We examined lamotrigine treatment impact on the neural interface of working memory and affect in PBD. Un-medicated, acutely ill, patients with mania and hypomania (n = 17), and healthy controls (HC; n = 13; mean age = 13.36 ± 2.55) performed an affective two-back functional magnetic resonance imaging task with blocks of angry vs neutral faces (i.e., angry face condition) or happy vs neutral faces (i.e., happy face condition) before treatment and at follow-up, after 8-week treatment with second-generation antipsychotics followed by 6 weeks of lamotrigine monotherapy. At baseline, for the angry face condition, PBD, relative to HC, showed reduced activation in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and right caudate; for the happy face condition, PBD showed increased activation in bilateral PFC and right amygdala and middle temporal gyrus. Post-treatment, PBD showed greater activation in right amygdala relative to HC for both conditions. Patients, relative to HC, exhibited greater changes over time in the right VLPFC and amygdala, left subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and left caudate for the angry face condition, and in right middle temporal gyrus for the happy face condition. Pharmacotherapy resulted in symptom improvement and normalization of higher cortical emotional and cognitive regions in patients relative to HC, suggesting that the VLPFC dysfunction may be state-specific in PBD. Amygdala was overactive in PBD, relative to HC, regardless of reduction in manic symptoms, and may be a trait marker of PBD. ",
pmid_20880360,Personally familiar faces are perceived categorically in face-selective regions other than the fusiform face area.,,"Neuroimaging studies of humans have provided inconsistent evidence with respect to the response properties of the fusiform face area (FFA). It has been claimed that neural populations within this region are sensitive to subtle differences between individual faces only when they are perceived as distinct identities [P. Rotshtein et al. (2005)Nature Neuroscience, 8, 107-113]. However, sensitivity to subtle changes of identity was found in previous studies using unfamiliar faces, for which categorical perception is less pronounced. Using functional magnetic resonance adaptation and morph continua of personally familiar faces, we investigated sensitivity to subtle changes between faces that were located either on the same or opposite sides of a categorical perceptual boundary. We found no evidence for categorical perception within the FFA, which exhibited reliable sensitivity to subtle changes of face identity whether these were perceived as distinct identities, or not. On the contrary, both the posterior superior temporal sulcus and prefrontal cortex exhibited categorical perception, as subtle changes between faces perceived as different identities yielded larger release from adaptation than those perceived as the same identity. These observations suggest that, whereas the FFA discriminates subtle physical changes of personally familiar faces, other regions encode faces in a categorical fashion. ",

A total of 255 high-quality data sources, published between 1990 and 2018 and representing 138 countries were identified. For countries without high quality in-country data, estimates were extrapolated from similar countries matched by economy, ethnicity, geography and language. Logistic regression was used to generate smoothed age-specific diabetes prevalence estimates (including previously undiagnosed diabetes) in adults aged 20-79 years. The global diabetes prevalence in 2019 is estimated to be 9.3% (463 million people), rising to 10.2% (578 million) by 2030 and 10.9% (700 million) by 2045. The prevalence is higher in urban (10.8%) than rural (7.2%) areas, and in high-income (10.4%) than low-income countries (4.0%). One in two (50.1%) people living with diabetes do not know that they have diabetes. The global prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance is estimated to be 7.5% (374 million) in 2019 and projected to reach 8.0% (454 million) by 2030 and 8.6% (548 million) by 2045. Just under half a billion people are living with diabetes worldwide and the number is projected to increase by 25% in 2030 and 51% in 2045. ",
pmid_18760955,Parahippocampal and retrosplenial contributions to human spatial navigation.,,"Spatial navigation is a core cognitive ability in humans and animals. Neuroimaging studies have identified two functionally defined brain regions that activate during navigational tasks and also during passive viewing of navigationally relevant stimuli such as environmental scenes: the parahippocampal place area (PPA) and the retrosplenial complex (RSC). Recent findings indicate that the PPA and RSC have distinct and complementary roles in spatial navigation, with the PPA more concerned with representation of the local visual scene and RSC more concerned with situating the scene within the broader spatial environment. These findings are a first step towards understanding the separate components of the cortical network that mediates spatial navigation in humans. ",
pmid_22784688,Ventral striatal activation during attribution of stimulus saliency and reward anticipation is correlated in unmedicated first episode schizophrenia patients.,,"Patients with schizophrenia show deficits in motivation, reward anticipation and salience attribution. Several functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) investigations revealed neurobiological correlates of these deficits, raising the hypothesis of a common basis in midbrain dopaminergic signaling. However, investigations of drug-naïve first-episode patients with comprehensive fMRI tasks are still missing. We recruited unmedicated schizophrenia spectrum patients (N=27) and healthy control subjects (N=27) matched for sex, age and educational levels. An established monetary reward anticipation task in combination with a novel task aiming at implicit salience attribution without the confound of monetary incentive was applied. Patients showed reduced right ventral striatal activation during reward anticipation. Furthermore, patients with a more pronounced hypoactivation attributed more salience to neutral stimuli, had more positive symptoms and better executive functioning. In the patient group, a more differentially active striatum during reward anticipation was correlated positively to differential ventral striatal activation in the implicit salience attribution task. In conclusion, a deficit in ventral striatal activation during reward anticipation can already be seen in drug-naïve, first episode schizophrenia patients. The data suggest that rather a deficit in differential ventral striatal activation than a generally reduced activation underlies motivational deficits in schizophrenia and that this deficit is related to the aberrant salience attribution.

We investigated the basis of this apparent contradiction using a complex object working memory task, a Categorical n-back (CN-BT). We examined whether the neural networks engaged by the CN-BT in children consist of the same brain regions as those in adults, but with a different magnitude of activation, or whether the networks are qualitatively different. Event-related fMRI was used to study differences in brain activation between healthy children ages 6 and 10 years, and young adults (20-28 years). Performance accuracy and RTs in 10-year-olds and adults were comparable, but the performance in 6-year-olds was lower. In adults, the CN-BT was highly effective in engaging the bilateral (L>R) ventral prefrontal cortex, the bilateral fusiform gyrus, posterior cingulate and precuneus, thus suggesting an involvement of the ventral visual stream, with related feature extraction and semantic labeling strategies. In children, the brain networks were distinctly different. They involved the premotor and parietal cortex, anterior insula, caudate/putamen, and the cerebellum, thus suggesting a predominant involvement of the visual dorsal and sensory-motor pathways, with related visual-spatial and action cognitive strategies. The findings indicate engagement of developmental networks in children reflecting task-effective brain activation. The age-related pattern of fMRI activation suggests a working hypothesis of a developmental shift from reliance on the dorsal visual stream and premotor/striatal/cerebellar networks in young children to reliance on the ventral prefrontal and inferior temporal networks in adults.

Mental simulation
Mindfulness
Neuroimaging
Self
Stress","Ruminative thoughts about a stressful event can seem subjectively real, as if the imagined event were happening in the moment. One possibility is that this subjective realism results from simulating the self as engaged in the stressful event (immersion). If so, then the process of decentering--disengaging the self from the event--should reduce the subjective realism associated with immersion, and therefore perceived stressfulness. To assess this account of decentering, we taught non-meditators a strategy for disengaging from imagined events, simply viewing these events as transient mental states (mindful attention). In a subsequent neuroimaging session, participants imagined stressful and non-stressful events, while either immersing themselves or adopting mindful attention. In conjunction analyses, mindful attention down-regulated the processing of stressful events relative to baseline, whereas immersion up-regulated their processing. In direct contrasts between mindful attention and immersion, mindful attention showed greater activity in brain areas associated with perspective shifting and effortful attention, whereas immersion showed greater activity in areas associated with self-processing and visceral states. These results suggest that mindful attention produces decentering by disengaging embodied senses of self from imagined situations so that affect does not develop. ",
pmid_20300040,Early menopausal hormone use influences brain regions used for visual working memory.,,"The cognitive benefit of postmenopausal hormone use is controversial; however, timing of treatment close to menopause may increase the likelihood of preserving cognitive function. We examined the effects of early-initiation hormone use on visual working memory, hypothesizing that long-term hormone use is associated with greater brain activation during visual working memory. This was a cross-sectional comparison of long-term early hormone users-current (n = 13) and past (n = 24; 2.1 +/- 1.0 years off hormones)-with never users (n = 18), using a visual memory task and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We evaluated 55 women older than 60 years at the University of Michigan's General Clinical Research Center. Hormone users had completed at least 10 continuous years of conjugated equine estrogens with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate, begun within 2 years of menopause. Women were excluded for illness, medication, intermittent estrogen use, phytoestrogen use, recent smoking, and MRI contraindications. The primary outcome was functional MRI-detected brain activity during the visual memory task. Compared with never users, both groups of hormone users had increased activation in the frontal and parietal cortices, insula, hippocampus, and cingulate; combined hormone users also had increased activation in the putamen and raphe (corrected P < 0.05 or uncorrected P < 0.001 with a priori hypothesis). Across the entire sample, the medial temporal cortex (P < 0.0001 right; P < 0.018 left) and right hippocampus (P < 0.0001) positively correlated with task performance. Hormone use was associated with increased brain activation during the visual memory task, in regions used for visual working memory. A positive correlation between activation and task performance suggests that early-initiation, long-term postmenopausal hormone use may benefit visual working memory. ",

fMRI","Emotions are an indispensable part of our mental life. The term emotion regulation refers to those processes that influence the generation, the experience and the expression of emotions. There is a great variety of strategies to regulate emotions efficiently, which are used in daily life and that have been investigated by cognitive neuroscience. Distraction guides attention to a secondary task. Reinterpretation, a variant of cognitive reappraisal, works by changing the meaning of an emotional stimulus. Detachment, another reappraisal strategy, refers to distancing oneself from an emotional stimulus, thereby reducing its personal relevance. Expressive Suppression modifies the behavioral or physiological response to an emotional stimulus. These four strategies are not equally effective in terms of emotion regulation success and have been shown to partly rely on different neuronal systems. Here, we compare for the first time the neural mechanisms of these typical strategies directly in a common functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of downregulation of negative emotions. Our results indicate that three of those strategies (Detachment, Expressive Suppression and Distraction) conjointly increase brain activation in a right prefronto-parietal regulation network and significantly reduce activation of the left amygdala. Compared to the other regulation strategies, Reinterpretation specifically recruited a different control network comprising left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal gyrus and was not effective in downregulation of the amygdala. We conclude that Detachment, Distraction and Expressive Suppression recruit very similar emotion regulation networks, whereas Reinterpretation is associated with activation of a qualitatively different network, making this regulation strategy a special one. Notably, Reinterpretation also proved to be the least effective strategy in neural terms, as measured by downregulation of amygdala activation. ",
pmid_25068669,Functional neuroimaging of the Iowa Gambling Task in older adults.,,"The neural systems most susceptible to age-related decline mirror the systems linked to decision making. Yet, the neural processes underlying decision-making disparities among older adults are not well understood. We sought to identify neural response patterns that distinguish 2 groups of older adults who exhibit divergent decision-making patterns. Participants were 31 healthy older adults (ages 59-88, 53% female), defined as advantageous or disadvantageous decision-makers based on Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) performance, who completed an alternate version of the IGT while undergoing functional MRI. The groups were indistinguishable on neuropsychological testing. We contrasted the BOLD signal between groups during 3 phases of the decision-making process: Prechoice (preselection), Prefeedback (postselection), and Feedback (receipt of gains/losses). We further examined whether BOLD signal varied as a function of age in each group. We observed greater activation among the IGT-Disadvantageous relative to -Advantageous older adults in the prefrontal cortex during the early phases of the decision-making process (Prechoice), and in posterior brain regions (e.g., the precuneus) during the later phases (Prefeedback and Feedback). We also found that with increasing age, IGT-Advantageous older adults showed increasing activation in the prefrontal cortex during all phases and increasing activation in the posterior cingulate during earlier phases of the decision process. By contrast, the IGT-Disadvantageous older adults exhibited a reduced or reversed trend. These functional differences may be a consequence of altered reward processing or differing compensatory strategies between IGT-Disadvantageous and -Advantageous older adults. This supports the notion that divergent neurobiological aging trajectories underlie disparate decision-making patterns. ",
pmid_25734018,Altered intra- and interregional synchronization in resting-state cerebral networks associated with chronic tinnitus.,,"Subjective tinnitus is hypothesized to arise from aberrant neural activity; however, its neural bases are poorly understood. To identify aberrant neural networks involved in chronic tinnitus, we compared the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) patterns of tinnitus patients and healthy controls. Resting-state fMRI measurements were obtained from a group of chronic tinnitus patients (n = 29) with normal hearing and well-matched healthy controls (n = 30). Regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis and functional connectivity analysis were used to identify abnormal brain activity; these abnormalities were compared to tinnitus distress. Relative to healthy controls, tinnitus patients had significant greater ReHo values in several brain regions including the bilateral anterior insula (AI), left inferior frontal gyrus, and right supramarginal gyrus. Furthermore, the left AI showed enhanced functional connectivity with the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), while the right AI had enhanced functional connectivity with the right MFG; these measures were positively correlated with Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaires (r = 0.459, P = 0.012 and r = 0.479, P = 0.009, resp.). Chronic tinnitus patients showed abnormal intra- and interregional synchronization in several resting-state cerebral networks; these abnormalities were correlated with clinical tinnitus distress. These results suggest that tinnitus distress is exacerbated by attention networks that focus on internally generated phantom sounds. ",
pmid_20423700,"Processing of food pictures: influence of hunger, gender and calorie content.",,"In most cases obesity, a major risk factor for diabetes mellitus type 2 and other associated chronic diseases, is generated by excessive eating. For a better understanding of eating behavior, it is necessary to determine how it is modulated by factors such as the calorie content of food, satiety and gender. Twelve healthy normal weighted participants (six female) were investigated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. In order to prevent the influence of social acceptability, an implicit one-back task was chosen for stimulus presentation. We presented food (high- and low-caloric) and non-food pictures in a block design and subjects had to indicate by button press whether two consecutive pictures were the same or not. Each subject performed the task in a hungry and satiated state on two different days. High-caloric pictures compared to low-caloric pictures led to increased activity in food processing and reward related areas, like the orbitofrontal and the insular cortex. In addition, we found activation differences in visual areas (occipital lobe), despite the fact that the stimuli were matched for their physical features. Detailed investigation also revealed gender specific effects in the fusiform gyrus. Women showed higher activation in the fusiform gyrus while viewing high-caloric pictures in the hungry state. This study shows that the calorie content of food pictures modulates the activation of brain areas related to reward processing and even early visual areas. In addition, satiation seems to influence the processing of food pictures differently in men and women. Even though an implicit task was used, activation differences could also be observed in the orbitofrontal cortex, known to be activated during explicit stimulation with food related stimuli. ",

resting state fMRI","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with increased functional connectivity in specific neural networks. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), the gold-standard treatment for acute, treatment-resistant MDD, but temporal dependencies between networks associated with ECT response have yet to be investigated. In the present longitudinal, case-control investigation, we used independent component analysis to identify distinct networks of brain regions with temporally coherent hemodynamic signal change and functional network connectivity (FNC) to assess component time course correlations across these networks. MDD subjects completed imaging and clinical assessments immediately prior to the ECT series and a minimum of 5 days after the last ECT treatment. We focused our analysis on four networks affected in MDD: the subcallosal cingulate gyrus, default mode, dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC). In an older sample of ECT subjects (n = 12) with MDD, remission associated with the ECT series reverses the relationship from negative to positive between the posterior default mode (p_DM) and two other networks: the DMPFC and left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (l_DLPFC). Relative to demographically healthy subjects (n = 12), the FNC between the p_DM areas and the DMPFC normalizes with ECT response. The FNC changes following treatment did not correlate with symptom improvement; however, a direct comparison between ECT remitters and non-remitters showed the pattern of increased FNC between the p_DM and l_DLPFC following ECT to be specific to those who responded to the treatment. The differences between ECT remitters and non-remitters suggest that this increased FNC between p_DM areas and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is a neural correlate and potential biomarker of recovery from a depressed episode.

A total of 29 adults with ADHD and 25 control individuals were recruited. They completed an event-related-design Go/No-go task under functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning. Both the ADHD group and the control group exhibited activation of the frontostriatal network when processing response inhibition. They also exhibited activation of the frontoinsula cortex and anterior cingulate in error processing. Adults with ADHD have a lower brain activation of error processing over the right inferior frontal lobe adjacent to the insula than control individuals. The altered frontoinsula cortex activation may represent the mechanism of error processing deficit among adults with ADHD. ,

We examined functional connectivity in a clinically homogenous sample of 34 early course schizophrenia patients compared with/to 19 healthy controls using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). Mean duration of illness for schizophrenia patients was 4 ± 1.78 years. Following a comprehensive clinical assessment, rsfMRI data were acquired using a 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging scanner, and analyzed using FSL version 5.01 software (FMRIB's Software Library, www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl). Compared to healthy controls, schizophrenia patients had significantly decreased functional connectivity in the left fronto-parietal network, lateral and medial visual network, motor network, default mode network and auditory network. Our data suggests significant functional hypoconnectivity in selected brain networks in early schizophrenia patients compared to controls. It is likely that the observed functional hypoconnectivity may be associated with features of schizophrenia other than those examined in this study. It is possible that hypoconnectivity is necessary but not sufficient to the clinical manifestation of schizophrenia. The examination of functional connectivity as a biomarker should be extended to a wider array of disease phenotypes to better understand its significance. ",

physical activity
yoga","Chronic stress contributes to both mental and physical illness. A high prevalence and cost of stress-related illnesses North America warrants investigation into alternative or complementary therapies which may help reduce adverse reactions to stressful stimuli. Emotion regulation is the process of monitoring and adjusting emotional responses to environmental stimuli and stressors. Individuals who participate in physical activity are less likely to have adverse responses to potentially stressful situations, potentially due to adaptions in emotion regulation. Yoga is a form of physical activity involving stretching exercises and meditation, that may lessen individuals' levels of stress and anxiety and improve emotion regulation. High-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) is considered a measure of parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity during the emotion regulation. Measuring HRV and brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a useful, noninvasive approach to evaluating ""neurovisceral"" components of emotion regulation. We aimed to determine whether yoga practitioners (YP) exhibit different patterns of brain activation compared to recreational athletes (RA) without current yoga experience, while viewing emotionally arousing visual stimuli. Our secondary aim was to examine potential differences across groups in HRV throughout the presentation of these stimuli. Analysis of fMRI data during exposure to emotion-evoking (EE) stimuli revealed that the YP group activated two unique brain areas, namely the superior parietal lobule and the supramarginal gyrus. These areas have been associated with attentional awareness and reduced egocentric bias, processes that have been implicated in emotion regulation by others. The RA group activated the inferior middle frontal cortex, an area associated with cognitive reappraisal during emotion regulation. The YP group also demonstrated a trend towards a higher ratio of low- to high-frequency HRV compared to the RA group. The present findings support the presence of experience-dependent neurovisceral mechanisms associated with emotion regulation. Individuals who practice yoga regulate their neurovisceral responses to potentially stressful external stimuli in a different manner than recreational athletes who do not engage in yoga practice. The present study had a small sample size (RA:  ",
pmid_16107540,Distinct basal ganglia territories are engaged in early and advanced motor sequence learning.,,"In this study, we used functional MRI (fMRI) at high field (3T) to track the time course of activation in the entire basal ganglia circuitry, as well as other motor-related structures, during the explicit learning of a sequence of finger movements over a month of training. Fourteen right-handed healthy volunteers had to practice 15 min daily a sequence of eight moves using the left hand. MRI sessions were performed on days 1, 14 and 28. In both putamen, activation decreased with practice in rostrodorsal (associative) regions. In contrast, there was a significant signal increase in more caudoventral (sensorimotor) regions of the putamen. Subsequent correlation analyses between signal variations and behavioral variables showed that the error rate (movement accuracy) was positively correlated with signal changes in areas activated during early learning, whereas reaction time (movement speed) was negatively correlated with signal changes in areas activated during advanced learning stages, including the sensorimotor putamen and globus pallidus. These results suggest the possibility that motor representations shift from the associative to the sensorimotor territories of the striato-pallidal complex during the explicit learning of motor sequences, suggesting that motor skills are stored in the sensorimotor territory of the basal ganglia that supports a speedy performance.

pmid_19560123,Ventral striatal activation during reward anticipation correlates with impulsivity in alcoholics.,,"Alcohol dependence is often associated with impulsivity, which may be correlated with dysfunction of the brain reward system. We explored whether functional brain activation during anticipation of incentive stimuli is associated with impulsiveness in detoxified alcoholics and healthy control subjects. Nineteen detoxified male alcoholics and 19 age-matched healthy men participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study using a monetary incentive delay (MID) task, in which visual cues predicted that a rapid response to a subsequent target stimulus would either result in monetary gain, avoidance of monetary loss, or no consequence. Impulsivity was assessed with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-Version 10 (BIS-10). Detoxified alcoholics showed reduced activation of the ventral striatum during anticipation of monetary gain relative to healthy control subjects. Low activation of the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate during gain anticipation was correlated with high impulsivity only in alcoholics, not in control subjects. This study suggests that reduced ventral striatal recruitment during anticipation of conventional rewards in alcoholics may be related to their increased impulsivity and indicate possibilities for enhanced treatment approaches in alcohol dependence.

pmid_18483136,Response to emotional expressions in generalized social phobia and generalized anxiety disorder: evidence for separate disorders.,,"Generalized social phobia involves fear/avoidance, specifically of social situations, whereas generalized anxiety disorder involves intrusive worry about diverse circumstances. It remains unclear the degree to which these two, often comorbid, conditions represent distinct disorders or alternative presentations of a single, core underlying pathology. Functional magnetic resonance imaging assessed the neural response to facial expressions in generalized social phobia and generalized anxiety disorder. Individuals matched on age, IQ, and gender with generalized social phobia without generalized anxiety disorder (N=17), generalized anxiety disorder (N=17), or no psychopathology (N=17) viewed neutral, fearful, and angry expressions while ostensibly making a simple gender judgment. The patients with generalized social phobia without generalized anxiety disorder showed increased activation to fearful relative to neutral expressions in several regions, including the amygdala, compared to healthy individuals. This increased amygdala response related to self-reported anxiety in patients with generalized social phobia without generalized anxiety disorder. In contrast, patients with generalized anxiety disorder showed significantly less activation to fearful relative to neutral faces compared to the healthy individuals. They did show significantly increased response to angry expressions relative to healthy individuals in a lateral region of the middle frontal gyrus. This increased lateral frontal response related to self-reported anxiety in patients with generalized anxiety disorder. These results suggest that neural circuitry dysfunctions differ in generalized social phobia and generalized anxiety disorder. ",

reward
ventral striatum","Substance use disorder is characterized by a transition from volitional to compulsive responding for drug reward. A possible explanation for this transition may be that alcohol-dependent patients (ADP) show a general propensity for a history of rewarded instrumental responses, and these rewarded responses may boost the activation of motivational neurocircuitry for additional reward. Brain imaging studies of decision-making have demonstrated that ADP relative to controls (CON) often show altered neural activation in response to anticipating and receiving rewards, but the majority of studies have not investigated how past performance affects activation. A potential exists for ADP to show increased sensitivity to reward as a function of reward delivery history. In the current study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural correlates of risky decision-making in ADP (n = 18) and CON (n = 18) while they played a two-choice monetary risk-taking game. In addition to investigating general neural recruitment by risky decision-making, we also modeled each participant's running total of monetary earnings in order to determine areas of activation that correlated with cumulative reward. We found that ADP and CON showed few differences in behavior or in mesolimbic activation by choice for, and receipt of, risky gains. However, when including a cumulative-earnings covariate, ADP exhibited heightened striatal activation that correlated with total earnings during the choice event in the task. The heightened contextual sensitivity of striatal responses to cumulative earnings in ADP may represent a general neurobiological affective substrate for development of automatized instrumental behavior.

pmid_22574121,Pavlovian reward prediction and receipt in schizophrenia: relationship to anhedonia.,,"Reward processing abnormalities have been implicated in the pathophysiology of negative symptoms such as anhedonia and avolition in schizophrenia. However, studies examining neural responses to reward anticipation and receipt have largely relied on instrumental tasks, which may confound reward processing abnormalities with deficits in response selection and execution. 25 chronic, medicated outpatients with schizophrenia and 20 healthy controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging using a pavlovian reward prediction paradigm with no response requirements. Subjects passively viewed cues that predicted subsequent receipt of monetary reward or non-reward, and blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal was measured at the time of cue presentation and receipt. At the group level, neural responses to both reward anticipation and receipt were largely similar between groups. At the time of cue presentation, striatal anticipatory responses did not differ between patients and controls. Right anterior insula demonstrated greater activation for nonreward than reward cues in controls, and for reward than nonreward cues in patients. At the time of receipt, robust responses to receipt of reward vs. nonreward were seen in striatum, midbrain, and frontal cortex in both groups. Furthermore, both groups demonstrated responses to unexpected versus expected outcomes in cortical areas including bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Individual difference analyses in patients revealed an association between physical anhedonia and activity in ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex during anticipation of reward, in which greater anhedonia severity was associated with reduced activation to money versus no-money cues. In ventromedial prefrontal cortex, this relationship held among both controls and patients, suggesting a relationship between anticipatory activity and anhedonia irrespective of diagnosis. These findings suggest that in the absence of response requirements, brain responses to reward receipt are largely intact in medicated individuals with chronic schizophrenia, while reward anticipation responses in left ventral striatum are reduced in those patients with greater anhedonia severity.

pmid_26559309,Antidepressant Effects of Electroconvulsive Therapy Correlate With Subgenual Anterior Cingulate Activity and Connectivity in Depression.,,"The mechanisms underlying the effects of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in major depressive disorder (MDD) are not fully understood. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a new tool to study the effects of brain stimulation interventions, particularly ECT. The authors aim to investigate the mechanisms of ECT in MDD by rs-fMRI.They used rs-fMRI to measure functional changes in the brain of first-episode, treatment-naive MDD patients (n = 23) immediately before and then following 8 ECT sessions (brief-pulse square-wave apparatus, bitemporal). They also computed voxel-wise amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) as a measure of regional brain activity and selected the left subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) to evaluate functional connectivity between the sgACC and other brain regions.Increased regional brain activity measured by ALFF mainly in the left sgACC following ECT. Functional connectivity of the left sgACC increased in the ipsilateral parahippocampal gyrus, pregenual ACC, contralateral middle temporal pole, and orbitofrontal cortex. Importantly, reduction in depressive symptoms were negatively correlated with increased ALFF in the left sgACC and left hippocampus, and with distant functional connectivity between the left sgACC and contralateral middle temporal pole. That is, across subjects, as depression improved, regional brain activity in sgACC and its functional connectivity increased in the brain.Eight ECT sessions in MDD patients modulated activity in the sgACC and its networks. The antidepressant effects of ECT were negatively correlated with sgACC brain activity and connectivity. These findings suggest that sgACC-associated prefrontal-limbic structures are associated with the therapeutic effects of ECT in MDD. ",

ventral visual stream","Converging lines of evidence point to the occipitotemporal cortex (OTC) as a critical structure in visual perception. For instance, human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has revealed a modular organisation of object-selective, face-selective, body-selective and scene-selective visual areas in the OTC, and disruptions to the processing within these regions, either in neuropsychological patients or through transcranial magnetic stimulation, can produce category-specific deficits in visual recognition. Here we show, using fMRI and pattern classification methods, that the activity in the OTC also represents how stimuli will be interacted with by the body--a level of processing more traditionally associated with the preparatory activity in sensorimotor circuits of the brain. Combining functional mapping of different OTC areas with a real object-directed delayed movement task, we found that the pre-movement spatial activity patterns across the OTC could be used to predict both the action of an upcoming hand movement (grasping vs. reaching) and the effector (left hand vs. right hand) to be used. Interestingly, we were able to extract this wide range of predictive movement information even though nearly all OTC areas showed either baseline-level or below baseline-level activity prior to action onset. Our characterisation of different OTC areas according to the features of upcoming movements that they could predict also revealed a general gradient of effector-to-action-dependent movement representations along the posterior-anterior OTC axis. These findings suggest that the ventral visual pathway, which is well known to be involved in object recognition and perceptual processing, plays a larger than previously expected role in preparing object-directed hand actions.

representational similarity analysis","Previous studies have revealed that phonological processing of Chinese characters elicited activation in the left prefrontal cortex, bilateral parietal cortex, and occipitotemporal regions. However, it is controversial what role the left middle frontal gyrus plays in Chinese character reading, and whether the core regions (e.g., the left superior temporal gyrus and supramarginal gyrus) for phonological processing of alphabetic languages are also involved in Chinese character reading. To address these questions, the present study used both univariate and multivariate analysis (i.e., representational similarity analysis, RSA) to explore neural representations of phonological information during Chinese character reading. Participants were scanned while performing a reading aloud task. Univariate activation analysis revealed a widely distributed network for word reading, including the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, lateral temporal cortex, and occipitotemporal cortex. More importantly, RSA showed that the left prefrontal (i.e., the left middle frontal gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus) and bilateral occipitotemporal areas (i.e., the left inferior and middle temporal gyrus and bilateral fusiform gyrus) represented phonological information of Chinese characters. These results confirmed the importance of the left middle frontal gyrus and regions in ventral pathway in representing phonological information of Chinese characters. ",

A total of 10 healthy right-handed volunteers were studied. fMRI was performed with two different paradigms; namely, pressure and acupuncture stimulation at acupuncture points LI11 and ST36 on the left. fMRI data were analyzed using SPM2. In comparison with the left LI11 pressure stimulation, both sides of the parahippocampal gyrus, cerebellum, left side of thalamus, and right side of posterior cingulate regions were more activated by the left LI11 acupuncture stimulation. In comparison with the left ST36 pressure stimulation, the secondary motor cortex, limbic system (cingulate gyrus, posterior cingulate), primary visual cortex, pons, and medulla regions were more activated by left ST36 acupuncture stimulation. In comparison with the left ST36 pressure stimulation, both side of BA 4 and BA 6 were more activated by the LI11 pressure stimulation. In comparison with the left LI11 acupuncture stimulation, left BA 6, BA 8, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) were more activated by the left ST36 acupuncture stimulation. In conclusion, brain signal activation patterns according to the stimulation methods and acupoints were observed to differ. Acupuncture stimulation activated more regions than pressure at the same acupoint. In particular, acupuncture stimulation activated the limbic system, such as the parahippocampal gyrus and ACC. ",
pmid_12067701,Functional MRI of motor sequence acquisition: effects of learning stage and performance.,,"Neural networks of motor control are well understood and the motor domain therefore lends itself to the study of learning. Neuroimaging of motor learning has demonstrated fronto-parietal, subcortical, and cerebellar involvement. However, there is conflicting evidence on the specific functional contributions of individual regions and their relative importance for early and advanced stages of learning. Using functional MRI (fMRI), we examined hemodynamic effects in seven right-handed men during brief episodes of explicit learning of novel six-digit sequences (experiments 1 and 2) and during prolonged learning of an eight-digit sequence (experiment 3), all performed with the dominant hand. Brief episodes of new learning were predominantly associated with bilateral activations in premotor and supplementary motor areas, superior and inferior parietal cortices, and anterior cerebellum. In experiment 2, which included a control condition matched for complexity of motor execution, we also found unexpectedly strong activation in the bilateral inferior frontal lobes. In experiment 3, analysis of task by learning stage interactions showed greater involvement of the bilateral superior parietal lobes, the right middle frontal gyrus, and the left caudate nucleus during early stages, whereas left occipito-temporal and superior frontal cortex as well as the bilateral parahippocampal region were more activated during late learning stages. Analysis of task by performance interactions (based on each subject's response times and accuracy during each scan) showed effects in bilateral fronto-polar, right hippocampal, and anterior cerebellar regions associated with high levels of performance, as well as inverse effects in bilateral occipito-parietal regions. We conclude that superior parietal and occipital regions are most intensely involved in visually driven explicit digit sequence learning during early stages and low performance, whereas later stages of acquisition and higher levels of performance are characterized by stronger recruitment of prefrontal and mediotemporal regions.

pmid_22714121,Neural changes associated with appetite information processing in schizophrenic patients after 16 weeks of olanzapine treatment.,,"There is evidence that some atypical antipsychotics, including olanzapine, can produce unwanted metabolic side effects, weight gain and diabetes. However, neuronal correlates of change related to food information processing have not been investigated with these medications. We studied the effect of a pharmacological manipulation with an antipsychotic known to cause weight gain on metabolites, cognitive tasks and neural correlates related to food regulation. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in conjunction with a task requiring visual processing of appetitive stimuli in schizophrenic patients and healthy controls before and after 16 weeks of antipsychotic medication with olanzapine. In patients, the psychological and neuronal changes associated following the treatment correlated with appetite control measures and metabolite levels in fasting blood samples. After 16 weeks of olanzapine treatment, the patients gained weight, increased their waist circumference, had fewer positive schizophrenia symptoms, a reduced ghrelin plasma concentration and an increased concentration of triglycerides, insulin and leptin. In premotor area, somatosensory cortices as well as bilaterally in the fusiform gyri, the olanzapine treatment increased the neural activity related to appetitive information in schizophrenic patients to similar levels relative to healthy individuals. However, a higher increase in sensitivity to appetitive stimuli after the treatment was observed in insular cortices, amygdala and cerebellum in schizophrenic patients as compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, these changes in neuronal activity correlated with changes in some metabolites and cognitive measurements related to appetite regulation. ",
pmid_22945620,"Toward clinically useful neuroimaging in depression treatment: prognostic utility of subgenual cingulate activity for determining depression outcome in cognitive therapy across studies, scanners, and patient characteristics.",,"CONTEXT Among depressed individuals not receiving medication in controlled trials, 40% to 60% respond to cognitive therapy (CT). Multiple previous studies suggest that activity in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC; Brodmann area 25) predicts outcome in CT for depression, but these results have not been prospectively replicated. OBJECTIVE To examine whether sgACC activity is a reliable and robust prognostic outcome marker of CT for depression and whether sgACC activity changes in treatment. DESIGN Two inception cohorts underwent assessment with functional magnetic resonance imaging using different scanners on a task sensitive to sustained emotional information processing before and after 16 to 20 sessions of CT, along with a sample of control participants who underwent testing at comparable intervals. SETTING A hospital outpatient clinic. PATIENTS Forty-nine unmedicated depressed adults and 35 healthy controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Pretreatment sgACC activity in an a priori region in response to negative words was correlated with residual severity and used to classify response and remission. RESULTS As expected, in both samples, participants with the lowest pretreatment sustained sgACC reactivity in response to negative words displayed the most improvement after CT (R2 = 0.29, >75% correct classification of response, >70% correct classification of remission). Other a priori regions explained additional variance. Response/remission in cohort 2 was predicted based on thresholds from cohort 1. Subgenual anterior cingulate activity remained low for patients in remission after treatment. CONCLUSIONS Neuroimaging provides a quick, valid, and clinically applicable way of assessing neural systems associated with treatment response/remission. Subgenual anterior cingulate activity, in particular, may reflect processes that interfere with treatment (eg, emotion generation) in addition to its putative regulatory role; alternately, its absence may facilitate treatment response.

pmid_22162145,Neural correlates of creative writing: an fMRI study.,,"Cerebral activations involved in actual writing of a new story and the associated correlates with creative performance are still unexplored. To investigate the different aspects of the creative writing process, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging while 28 healthy participants performed a new paradigm related to creative writing: ""brainstorming"" (planning a story) and ""creative writing"" (writing a new and creative continuation of a given literary text), as well as an additional control paradigm of ""reading"" and ""copying."" Individual verbal creativity was assessed with a verbal creativity test and creative performance with a qualitative rating of the creative products. ""brainstorming"" engaged cognitive, linguistic, and creative brain functions mainly represented in a parieto-frontal-temporal network, as well as writing preparation, and visual and imaginative processing. ""creative writing"" activated motor and visual brain areas for handwriting and additionally, cognitive and linguistic areas. Episodic memory retrieval, free-associative and spontaneous cognition, and semantic integration were observed in a right lateralized activation pattern in bilateral hippocampi, bilateral temporal poles (BA 38), and bilateral posterior cingulate cortex in a ""creative writing"" minus ""copying"" comparison. A correlation analysis of ""creative writing"" minus ""copying"" with the creativity index revealed activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 45) and the left temporal pole (BA 38). Thus, verbal creativity during ""creative writing"" is associated with verbal and semantic memory as well as semantic integration. ",
pmid_15750588,Gaze fixation and the neural circuitry of face processing in autism.,,"Diminished gaze fixation is one of the core features of autism and has been proposed to be associated with abnormalities in the neural circuitry of affect. We tested this hypothesis in two separate studies using eye tracking while measuring functional brain activity during facial discrimination tasks in individuals with autism and in typically developing individuals. Activation in the fusiform gyrus and amygdala was strongly and positively correlated with the time spent fixating the eyes in the autistic group in both studies, suggesting that diminished gaze fixation may account for the fusiform hypoactivation to faces commonly reported in autism. In addition, variation in eye fixation within autistic individuals was strongly and positively associated with amygdala activation across both studies, suggesting a heightened emotional response associated with gaze fixation in autism.

pmid_9405692,Role of left inferior prefrontal cortex in retrieval of semantic knowledge: a reevaluation.,,"A number of neuroimaging findings have been interpreted as evidence that the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) subserves retrieval of semantic knowledge. We provide a fundamentally different interpretation, that it is not retrieval of semantic knowledge per se that is associated with left IFG activity but rather selection of information among competing alternatives from semantic memory. Selection demands were varied across three semantic tasks in a single group of subjects. Functional magnetic resonance imaging signal in overlapping regions of left IFG was dependent on selection demands in all three tasks. In addition, the degree of semantic processing was varied independently of selection demands in one of the tasks. The absence of left IFG activity for this comparison counters the argument that the effects of selection can be attributed solely to variations in degree of semantic retrieval. Our findings suggest that it is selection, not retrieval, of semantic knowledge that drives activity in the left IFG. ",
pmid_25496446,Electroacupuncture stimulation at sub-specific acupoint and non-acupoint induced distinct brain glucose metabolism change in migraineurs: a PET-CT study.,,"Acupuncture has analgesic effect to most pain conditions. Many neuroimaging studies were conducted to explore acupoint specificity in pain and other condition, but till now there is still discrepancy. Based on our previous finding, this study investigated the brain metabolism changes of acupuncture analgesia induced by sub-specific acupoint and non-acupoint stimulation. 30 migraineurs were included and randomly assigned to 3 groups: Acupuncture Group (AG), Sham Acupuncture Group (SAG) and Migraine Group (MG). In AG, a combination sub-specific points of Shaoyang meridians, Luxi (TE19), San Yangluo (TE8), and Xi Yangguan (GB33) has been stimulated with electroacupuncture, while non-acupoints for SAG were used and MG received no treatment. Positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET-CT) was used to identify differences in brain glucose metabolism between groups. In the AG, brain glucose metabolism increase compared with the MG was observed in the middle frontal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, the precuneus, parahippocampus, cerebellum and middle cingulate cortex (MCC), and decrease were observed in the left hemisphere of Middle Temporal Cortex (MTC).In the SAG, compared with MG, glucose metabolism increased in the poster cingulate cortex (PCC), insula, inferior temporal gyrus, MTC, superior temporal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, fusiform, inferior parietal lobe, superior parietal lobe, supramarginal gyrus, middle occipital lobe, angular and precuneus; while, decreased in cerebellum, parahippocampus. Acupuncture stimulation at both sub-specific acupoint and non-acupoint yields ameliorating effect to migraine pain, but with evidently differed central mechanism as measured by PET-CT. The pattern of brain glucose metabolism change in acupoint is pertinent and targeted, while in non-acupoint that was disordered and randomized. These finding may provide new perspectives into the validation of acupoint specificity, optimizing acupuncture analgesia and revealing central mechanism of acupuncture analgesia by neuroimaging measurement. This trial was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, with registration no. ChiCTR-TRC-11001813. ",

Engagement of ventral, but not dorsal, amygdala during unaware exposure to emotional faces.",,"The ability to selectively perceive items in the environment may be modulated by the emotional content of those items. The neural mechanism that underlies the privileged processing of emotionally salient content is poorly understood. Here, using fMRI, we investigated this issue via a binocular rivalry procedure when face stimuli depicting fearful or neutral expressions competed for awareness with a house. Results revealed an interesting dissociation in the amygdala during rivalry condition: Whereas its dorsal component exhibited dominant activation to aware fearful faces, a ventral component was more active during the suppression of fearful faces. Moreover, during rivalry, the dorsal and ventral components of the amygdala were coupled with segregated cortical activations in the brainstem and medial PFC, respectively. In summary, this study points to a differential involvement of two clusters within the amygdala and their connected networks in naturally occurring perceptual biases of emotional content in faces.

The same regions receive optokinetic, visual, and proprioceptive projections. We examined the cortical and subcortical projection of vestibular activity with visual and proprioceptive input eliminated during caloric stimulation (CS), using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Single-shot gradient-echo echoplanar image (EPI) volumes were sensitive to BOLD contrast in oblique orientation. We adopted a pharmacokinetic model for analysis of imaging data from 10 subjects as a group. The insular gyrus, intraparietal sulcus, superior temporal gyrus, hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, and thalamus showed activation by CS. Cortical and subcortical activation during CS in the present study was observed within regions less precisely delineated by other methods. As intraparietal sulcus activation showed right hemispheric dominance, this region may have an oculomotor projection as well as the vestibular input. ",
pmid_21777105,Neural correlates of social approach and withdrawal in patients with major depression.,,"Successful human interaction is based on correct recognition, interpretation, and appropriate reaction to facial affect. In depression, social skill deficits are among the most restraining symptoms leading to social withdrawal, thereby aggravating social isolation and depressive affect. Dysfunctional approach and withdrawal tendencies to emotional stimuli have been documented, but the investigation of their neural underpinnings has received limited attention. We performed an fMRI study including 15 depressive patients and 15 matched, healthy controls. All subjects performed two tasks, an implicit joystick task as well as an explicit rating task, both using happy, neutral, and angry facial expressions. Behavioral data analysis indicated a significant group effect, with depressed patients showing more withdrawal than controls. Analysis of the functional data revealed significant group effects for both tasks. Among other regions, we observed significant group differences in amygdala activation, with patients showing less response particularly during approach to happy faces. Additionally, significant correlations of amygdala activation with psychopathology emerged, suggesting that more pronounced symptoms are accompanied by stronger decreases of amygdala activation. Hence, our results demonstrate that depressed patients show dysfunctional social approach and withdrawal behavior, which in turn may aggravate the disorder by negative social interactions contributing to isolation and reinforcing cognitive biases.

pmid_20157743,Preliminary fMRI findings on the effects of event rate in adults with ADHD.,,"Inhibition problems in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are sensitive to stimulus event rate. This pilot study explores the neural basis of this increased susceptibility to event rate in ADHD. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was used in conjunction with the administration of a fast (1.5 s) and a slow (7 s) Go/No-Go task. Brain activity patterns and reaction times of ten young male adults with ADHD (two of whom were in partial remission) and ten healthy male controls were compared. The ADHD group responded slower than controls with greater variability but with similar number of errors. Accurate response inhibition in the ADHD group in the slow condition was associated with widespread fronto-striatal activation, including the thalamus. For correct Go trials only, the ADHD group compared with controls showed substantial under-activation in the slow condition. The observed abnormal brain activation in the slow condition in adults with ADHD supports a fronto-striatal etiology, and underlines a presumed activation regulation deficit. Larger sample sizes to further validate these preliminary findings are needed. ",
pmid_19951293,Greater activation in left hemisphere language-related regions during simple judgment tasks among substance-dependent patients in treatment for alcoholism.,,"Alcoholism is often associated with impaired emotional control. Alcoholics have also been found to have deficits in frontal lobe executive functions. Recent functional imaging studies have suggested that alcoholics show greater activation than nonalcoholics in circuits involving frontal lobes, as well as more posterior brain regions, when engaged in executive-type tasks. In this study, we compared brain activations of alcohol-dependent patients and healthy nonalcoholics while they performed 2 simple judgment tasks designed to activate frontal circuits involved in a basic form of decision making. Participants completed 1 judgment task that required an emotional judgment and 1 task that did not, which enabled us to study whether alcoholics had greater brain activation while performing executive tasks, and to determine if emotional tasks elicited even greater activation than nonemotional tasks. We performed functional magnetic resonance imaging scans while alcoholic patients and nonalcoholic controls viewed pictures from the International Affective Picture System. In 3 separate runs, participants viewed the images without making a judgment, determined whether the images were indoor or outdoor scenes, or decided if they liked or disliked the images. There was little difference in brain activation between alcoholics and controls when no judgment was required. When participants made judgments about either the location or whether they liked or disliked an image, however, we observed significantly increased activation in frontal, limbic, and temporal regions in the patients relative to the controls. Increases were particularly robust in the frontal lobe and in areas of the brain associated with language. When we compared the emotional to the nonemotional judgment, the alcoholics, but not the controls, showed greater activation in the ventral mesial frontal cortex. Alcoholic patients appear to use brain language areas more than nonalcoholics while making judgments about the setting or liking of emotionally arousing visual images. This increased activation may reflect a compensatory recruitment of brain regions to perform simple decision-making tasks. ",
pmid_12763194,Distinct prefrontal cortex activity associated with item memory and source memory for visual shapes.,,"In contrast to item memory, which refers to recognition or recall of previously presented information, source memory refers to memory for the context of previously presented information. The relatively few functional MRI (fMRI) source memory studies conducted to date have provided evidence that item memory and source memory are associated with differential activity in right and left prefrontal cortex, respectively. To both confirm this distinction in prefrontal cortex and to determine whether other differences in the neural substrates associated with these cognitive functions exist, an event-related fMRI study was conducted. In this study, item memory and source memory encoding phases were identical; participants viewed a series of abstract visual shapes presented on the left or right side of the screen and were instructed to remember each shape and its spatial location. During the item memory retrieval phase, shapes from the encoding phase were intermixed with new shapes and participants made an old-new judgment. During the source memory retrieval phase, all shapes were from the encoding phase and participants made a left-right judgment. An event-related analysis of item memory and source memory revealed a right and left prefrontal cortex distinction. Moreover, only item memory was associated with activity in the medial temporal lobes. These results confirm and extend previous findings that item memory and source memory are associated with distinct neural substrates. ",

Eighteen PD patients with RBD, 16 patients without RBD, and 19 age- and gender-matched normal controls underwent clinical assessment and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a 3.0T scanner. Resting-state fMRI scans were collected using an echo planar imaging sequence. Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) were calculated to measure spontaneous brain activity in each subject. Compared with PD patients without RBD, patients with RBD exhibited significantly decreased ALFF values (P < 0.001, cluster level) in primary motor cortex extending to premotor cortex. Compared with normal controls, PD patients exhibited decreased ALFF values (P < 0.001, cluster level) in caudate and putamen (P < 0.001, cluster level), and increased ALFF values (P = 0.03, cluster level) in prefrontal cortex. The altered spontaneous brain activity in motor cortex may contribute to the pathogenesis of RBD in PD patients, which further supports the idea that the pathophysiology of RBD involves not only midbrain dysfunction but also cerebral cortex abnormalities. Our findings provide additional insight into the neural mechanism of RBD and may drive future research to develop better treatment. 3 Technical Efficacy: Stage 3 J. MAGN. RESON.

pmid_17079703,Probing the working memory system in chronic fatigue syndrome: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study using the n-back task.,,"Up to 90% of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) report substantial cognitive difficulties. However, objective evidence supporting these claims is inconsistent. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study examined the neural correlates of working memory in patients with CFS compared with controls. Seventeen patients with CFS and 12 healthy control subjects were scanned while performing a parametric version of the n-back task (0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-back). Both groups performed comparably well and activated the verbal working memory network during all task levels. However, during the 1-back condition, patients with CFS showed greater activation than control subjects in medial prefrontal regions, including the anterior cingulate gyrus. Conversely, on the more challenging conditions, patients with CFS demonstrated reduced activation in dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal cortices. Furthermore, on the 2- and 3-back conditions, patients but not control subjects significantly activated a large cluster in the right inferior/medial temporal cortex. Trend analyses of task load demonstrated statistically significant differences in brain activation between the two groups as the demands of the task increased. These results suggest that patients with CFS show both quantitative and qualitative differences in activation of the working memory network compared with healthy control subjects. It remains to be determined whether these findings stay stable after successful treatment. ",

Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) using the DARTEL approach was performed to assess regional gray matter (GM) volumes. Additionally, individual performance on tests of attention was recorded to correlate ADHD related cognitive impairments with regional gray matter abnormalities. We found significantly smaller GM volume in subjects with ADHD compared to their matched controls within the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the occipital cortex, bilateral hippocampus/amygdala and in widespread cerebellar regions. Further, reductions of the ACC gray matter volume were found to correlate with scores of selective inattention. These findings underline that structural alterations in a widespread cortico-subcortical network seem to underlie the observable attention problems in patients with ADHD. ",

Toronto Structured Interview for Alexithymia","The ability to recognize subtle facial expressions can be valuable in social interaction to infer emotions and intentions of others. Research has shown that the personality trait of alexithymia is linked to difficulties labeling facial expressions especially when these are presented with temporal constraints. The present study investigates the neural mechanisms underlying this deficit. 50 young healthy volunteers had to label briefly presented (≤100ms) emotional (happy, angry, fearful) facial expressions masked by a neutral expression while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A multi-method approach (20-Item Toronto Alexithymia Scale and Toronto Structured Interview for Alexithymia) was administered to assess alexithymic tendencies. Behavioral results point to a global deficit of alexithymic individuals in labeling brief facial expressions. Alexithymia was related to decreased response of the ventral striatum to negative facial expressions. Moreover, alexithymia was associated with lowered activation in frontal, temporal and occipital cortices. Our data suggest that alexithymic individuals have difficulties in creating appropriate representations of the emotional state of other persons under temporal constraints. These deficiencies could lead to problems in labeling other people׳s facial emotions. ",

We performed structural magnetic resonance imaging and examined performance on a cognitive flexibility task (intra-extradimensional set shift and reversal; IED). We also presented subjects with fearful, disgust and anger facial emotional expressions. Participants were abstaining, multiply detoxified (MDTx; n = 12) or singly detoxified patients (SDTx; n = 17) and social drinker controls (n = 31). Alcoholic patients were less able than controls to change their behavior in accordance with the changing of the rules in the IED and they were less accurate in recognizing fearful expressions in particular. They also showed lower gray matter volume compared with controls in frontal brain areas, including inferior frontal cortex (IFC) and insula that mediate emotional processing, inferior parietal lobule and medial frontal cortex that mediate attentional and motor planning processes, respectively. Impairments in performance and some of the regional decreases in gray matter were greater in MDTx. Gray matter volume in IFC in patients was negatively correlated with the number of detoxifications, whereas inferior parietal lobule was negatively correlated with the control over drinking score (impaired control over drinking questionnaire). Performance in IED was also negatively correlated with gray matter volume in IFC/BA47, whereas recognition of fearful faces was positively correlated with the IFC gray matter. Repeated episodes of detoxification from alcohol, related to severity of dependency, are coupled with altered brain structure in areas of emotional regulation, attention and motor planning. Such changes may confer increased inability to switch behavior according to environmental demands and social incompetence, contributing to relapse. ",
pmid_27101425,Pharmacologic attenuation of cross-modal sensory augmentation within the chronic pain insula.,,"Pain can be elicited through all mammalian sensory pathways yet cross-modal sensory integration, and its relationship to clinical pain, is largely unexplored. Centralized chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia are often associated with symptoms of multisensory hypersensitivity. In this study, female patients with fibromyalgia demonstrated cross-modal hypersensitivity to visual and pressure stimuli compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that insular activity evoked by an aversive level of visual stimulation was associated with the intensity of fibromyalgia pain. Moreover, attenuation of this insular activity by the analgesic pregabalin was accompanied by concomitant reductions in clinical pain. A multivariate classification method using support vector machines (SVM) applied to visual-evoked brain activity distinguished patients with fibromyalgia from healthy controls with 82% accuracy. A separate SVM classification of treatment effects on visual-evoked activity reliably identified when patients were administered pregabalin as compared with placebo. Both SVM analyses identified significant weights within the insular cortex during aversive visual stimulation. These data suggest that abnormal integration of multisensory and pain pathways within the insula may represent a pathophysiological mechanism in some chronic pain conditions and that insular response to aversive visual stimulation may have utility as a marker for analgesic drug development.

This electrophysiological study examined inhibitory control and reward processing in adolescents with IGD during a go/no-go task and a gambling task. Behaviorally, the adolescents with IGD exhibited lower inhibitory control, as measured by the accuracy of no-go trials, and more risk seeking, as measured by the proportion of risky choices, than did the controls. Compared with the controls, the adolescents with IGD exhibited decreased no-go P3 and blunted feedback-related negativity (FRN) amplitudes following gains (gain FRN) but not losses. Thus, IGD in adolescents is potentially driven by dysfunction of the control system and the approach system rather than the avoidance system, supporting the neurobiological model of adolescent development.

pmid_25344114,Assessment of in vivo microstructure alterations in gray matter using DKI in Internet gaming addiction.,,"The aim of the current study was to investigate the utility of diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) in the detection of gray matter (GM) alterations in people suffering from Internet Gaming Addiction (IGA). DKI was applied to 18 subjects with IGA and to 21 healthy controls (HC). Whole-brain voxel-based analyses were performed with the following derived parameters: mean kurtosis metrics (MK), radial kurtosis (K⊥), and axial kurtosis (K//). A significance threshold was set at P <0.05, AlphaSim corrected. Pearson's correlation was performed to investigate the correlations between the Chen Internet Addiction Scale (CIAS) and the DKI-derived metrics of regions that differed between groups. Additionally, we used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to detect GM-volume differences between the two groups. Compared with the HC group, the IGA group demonstrated diffusional kurtosis parameters that were significantly less in GM of the right anterolateral cerebellum, right inferior and superior temporal gyri, right supplementary motor area, middle occipital gyrus, right precuneus, postcentral gyrus, right inferior frontal gyrus, left lateral lingual gyrus, left paracentral lobule, left anterior cingulate cortex, and median cingulate cortex. The bilateral fusiform gyrus, insula, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and thalamus also exhibited less diffusional kurtosis in the IGA group. MK in the left PCC and K⊥ in the right PCC were positively correlated with CIAS scores. VBM showed that IGA subjects had higher GM volume in the right inferior and middle temporal gyri, and right parahippocampal gyrus, and lower GM volume in the left precentral gyrus. The lower diffusional kurtosis parameters in IGA suggest multiple differences in brain microstructure, which may contribute to the underlying pathophysiology of IGA. DKI may provide sensitive imaging biomarkers for assessing IGA severity. ",

Social anxiety","Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by negative self-beliefs (NSBs) that are thought to maintain symptom severity-at least in part-by impairing emotion regulation. Few studies to date have investigated the neural basis of emotion regulation during NSBs in SAD. Moreover, different regulation strategies have not been directly compared, leaving open questions about the generality of emotion regulation deficits in SAD. Patients with SAD (n = 113) and healthy control subjects (n = 35) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while reacting to NSBs or attempting to downregulate negative emotions occasioned by NSBs using either reappraisal (reinterpreting negative beliefs) or acceptance (nonjudgmentally experiencing thoughts and emotions). Ratings of negative emotion were collected after each trial. When cued to do so, patients with SAD were able to downregulate negative emotions using both reappraisal and acceptance and demonstrated effective recruitment of frontoparietal regulatory regions. Patients with SAD demonstrated greater activation of default mode network and somatomotor regions for the react versus accept contrast. Both groups demonstrated reductions in frontoparietal and default mode network activation during acceptance relative to reappraisal. Greater SAD symptom severity was associated with lower activation in frontoparietal regions during both regulation conditions. There were no group differences in frontoparietal recruitment during two distinct emotion regulation strategies. However, individual differences in symptom severity within the SAD group were associated with frontoparietal regulation-related activation. Patients with SAD were differentiated from control subjects in default mode network recruitment patterns, suggesting that acceptance may be a useful task condition for revealing altered neural activity in SAD.

fMRI","Social exclusion is a distressing experience and can lead to both retaliatory and prosocial reactions toward the sources of exclusion. The way people react to social exclusion has been hypothesized to be shaped through chronic exposure to peer rejection. This functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging study examined associations between chronic peer rejection and retaliatory (i.e. punishing) and prosocial (i.e. forgiving) reactions to social exclusion and the neural processes underlying them. Chronically rejected (n=19) and stably highly accepted adolescents (n=27) distributed money between themselves and unknown others who previously included or excluded them in a virtual ball-tossing game (Cyberball). Decreasing the excluders' monetary profits (i.e., punishment) was associated with increased activity in the ventral striatum, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and parietal cortex in both groups. Compared to stably highly accepted adolescents, chronically rejected adolescents exhibited higher activity in the dorsal striatum and lateral prefrontal cortex - brain regions implicated in cognitive control - when they refrained from punishment and shared their money equally with (i.e. forgave) the excluders. These results provide insights into processes that might underlie the maintenance of peer rejection across development, such as difficulties controlling the urge to retaliate after exclusion. ",

This study compared global and regional brain volumes between treatment-respondent and treatment-resistant patients with schizophrenia, including a group of patients who were clozapine-resistant. T1-weighted brain MRIs were obtained on a 3T scanner in 20 controls and 52 people with schizophrenia who were selected based on their symptomatic responses to antipsychotic medication: 18 responded well to first-line atypical antipsychotics (FLR), 19 were treatment-resistant but responsive to clozapine monotherapy (TR), and 15 were ultra-treatment-resistant and did not respond to clozapine (UTR). Treatment groups were matched for disease duration and current psychopathology. SIENAX and FSL-VBM were used to investigate differences in the global brain, gray matter (GM), white matter, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid volumes, and regional GM volumes. GM volume was significantly reduced in the TR and UTR groups compared with controls and the FLR group (p < 0.05). GM volume was significantly reduced in TR patients compared with FLRs in the superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyri, pre- and post-central gyri, middle and superior frontal gyri, right supramarginal gyrus, and right lateral occipital cortex. UTR patients showed reduced GM compared with FLRs in their right parietal operculum and left cerebellum. No significant volume differences were observed between TR and UTR groups. These differences are unlikely to be solely due to medication effects, and reduced GM volume in treatment-resistant schizophrenia may represent an accelerated disease course or a different underlying pathology.

Psychosocial stress","Psychosocial stress is associated with an increased intake of palatable foods and weight gain in stress-reactive individuals. Personality traits have been shown to predict stress-reactivity. However, it is not known if personality traits influence brain activity in regions implicated in appetite control during psychosocial stress. The current study assessed whether Gray's Behavioural Inhibition System (BIS) scale, a measure of stress-reactivity, was related to the activity of brain regions implicated in appetite control during a stressful period. Twenty-two undergraduate students participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment once during a non-exam period and once during final exams in a counter-balanced order. In the scanner, they viewed food and scenery pictures. In the exam compared with the non-exam condition, BIS scores related to increased perceived stress and correlated with increased blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) response to high-calorie food images in regions implicated in food reward and subjective value, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, (vmPFC) and the amygdala. BIS scores negatively related to the functional connectivity between the vmPFC and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The results demonstrate that the BIS trait influences stress reactivity. This is observed both as an increased activity in brain regions implicated in computing the value of food cues and decreased connectivity of these regions to prefrontal regions implicated in self-control. This suggests that the effects of real life stress on appetitive brain function and self-control is modulated by a personality trait. This may help to explain why stressful periods can lead to overeating in vulnerable individuals. ",
pmid_16317024,Cerebellar damage produces selective deficits in verbal working memory.,,"The cerebellum is often active in imaging studies of verbal working memory, consistent with a putative role in articulatory rehearsal. While patients with cerebellar damage occasionally exhibit a mild impairment on standard neuropsychological tests of working memory, these tests are not diagnostic for exploring these processes in detail. The current study was designed to determine whether damage to the cerebellum is associated with impairments on a range of verbal working memory tasks, and if so, under what circumstances. Moreover, we assessed the hypothesis that these impairments are related to impaired rehearsal mechanisms. Patients with damage to the cerebellum (n = 15) exhibited a selective deficit in verbal working memory: spatial forward and backward spans were normal, but forward and backward verbal spans were lower than controls. While the differences were significant, digit spans were relatively preserved, especially in comparison to the dramatic reductions typically observed in classic 'short-term memory' patients with perisylvian brain damage. The patients tended to be more impaired on a verbal version compared to a spatial version of a working memory task with a long delay and this impairment was correlated with overall symptom and dysarthria severity. These results are consistent with a contribution of the cerebellum to rehearsal and suggest that inclusion of a delay before recall is especially detrimental in individuals with cerebellar damage. However, when we examined markers of rehearsal (i.e. word-length and articulatory suppression effects) in an immediate serial recall task, we found that qualitative aspects of the patients' rehearsal strategies were unaffected. We propose that the cerebellum may contribute to verbal working memory during the initial phonological encoding and/or by strengthening memory traces rather than by fundamentally subserving covert articulatory rehearsal.

pmid_19413479,Item retrieval and competition in noun and verb generation: an FMRI study.,,"Selection between competing responses and stimulus-response association strength is thought to affect performance during verb generation. However, the specific contribution of these two processes remains unclear. Here we used fMRI to investigate the role of selection and association within frontal and BG circuits that are known to be involved in verb production. Subjects were asked to generate verbs from nouns in conditions requiring either high or low selection, but with constant association strength, and in conditions of weak or strong association strength, now with constant selection demands. Furthermore, we examined the role of selection and association during noun generation from noun stimuli. We found that the midpart of the left inferior frontal gyrus was more active in conditions requiring high compared with low selection, with matched association strength. The same left inferior frontal region activated irrespective of verb or noun generation. Results of ROI analyses showed effects of association strength only for verb generation and specifically in the anterior/ventral part of the left inferior frontal gyrus. Moreover, the BG were more active when weakly associated verbs had to be produced relative to weakly associated nouns. These results highlight a functional segregation within the left inferior frontal gyrus for verb generation. More generally, the findings suggest that both factors of selection between competing responses and association strength are important during single-word production with the latter factor becoming particularly critical when task-irrelevant stimuli interfere with the current task (here nouns during verb production), triggering additional activation of the BG.

The authors examined the cerebral perfusion differences among 17 Parkinson disease (PD) patients, 17 PD with dementia (PDD) patients, and 17 healthy controls and used ASL-MRI to assess the effects of dopaminergic therapies on perfusion in the patients. The authors demonstrated progressive widespread cortical hypoperfusion in PD and PDD and robust effects for the dopaminergic therapies. Specifically, dopaminergic medications further decreased frontal lobe and cerebellum perfusion in the PD and PDD groups, respectively. These patterns of hypoperfusion could be related to cognitive dysfunctions and disease severity. Furthermore, desensitization to dopaminergic therapies in terms of cortical perfusion was found as the disease progressed, supporting the concept that long-term therapies are associated with the therapeutic window narrowing. The highly sensitive pharmaceutical response of ASL allows clinicians and researchers to easily and effectively quantify the absolute perfusion status, which might prove helpful for therapeutic planning.

The present study compared the brain function of tobacco-exposed (n=7) and unexposed (n=11) 12-year-olds during a Go/No-Go response inhibition task using an event-related functional MRI (fMRI) design. Prenatal alcohol exposure, neonatal medical problems, environmental risk, IQ, current environmental smoke exposure, and handedness were statistically controlled. Tobacco-exposed children showed greater activation in a relatively large and diverse set of regions, including left frontal, right occipital, and bilateral temporal and parietal regions. In contrast, unexposed but not exposed children showed activation in the cerebellum, which prior research has indicated is important for attention and motor preparation. The diversity of regions showing greater activation among tobacco-exposed children suggests that their brain function is characterized by an inefficient recruitment of regions required for response inhibition.

pmid_16846694,Cortical effects of anticipation and endogenous modulation of visceral pain assessed by functional brain MRI in irritable bowel syndrome patients and healthy controls.,,"Visceral pain processing is abnormal in a majority of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. Aberrant endogenous nociceptive modulation and anticipation are possible underlying mechanisms investigated in the current study. Twelve IBS patients and 12 matched healthy controls underwent brain fMRI scanning during the following randomised stimuli: sham and painful rectal distensions by barostat without and with simultaneous activation of endogenous descending nociceptive inhibition using ice water immersion of the foot for heterotopic stimulation. Heterotopic stimulation decreased rectal pain scores from 3.7+/-0.2 to 3.1+/-0.3 (mean+/-SE, scale 0-5) in controls (p<0.01), but not significantly in IBS. Controls differed from IBS patients in showing significantly greater activation bilaterally in the anterior insula, SII and putamen during rectal stimulation alone compared to rectal plus heterotopic stimulation. Greater activation during rectal plus heterotopic versus rectal stimulation was seen bilaterally in SI and the right superior temporal gyrus in controls and in the right inferior lobule and bilaterally in the superior temporal gyrus in IBS. Rectal pain scores were similarly low during sham stimulation in both groups, but brain activation patterns differed. In conclusion, IBS patients showed dysfunctional endogenous inhibition of pain and concomitant aberrant activation of brain areas involved in pain processing and integration. Anticipation of rectal pain was associated with different brain activation patterns in IBS involving multiple interoceptive, homeostatic, associative and emotional areas, even though pain scores were similar during sham distension. The aberrant activation of endogenous pain inhibition appears to involve circuitry relating to anticipation as well as pain processing itself. ",
pmid_24068801,Decrease of gray matter volume in the midbrain is associated with treatment response in medication-overuse headache: possible influence of orbitofrontal cortex.,,"Patients with chronic daily headache and overuse of analgesics, triptans, or other acute headache compounds, are considered to suffer from medication-overuse headache (MOH). This implies that medication overuse is the cause of headache chronification. It remains a key question why only two-thirds of patients with chronic migraine-like headache and overuse of pain medication improve after detoxification, whereas the remainder continue to have chronic headache. In the present longitudinal MRI study, we used voxel-based morphometry to investigate gray matter changes related to medication withdrawal in a group of humans with MOH. As a main result, we found that only patients with significant clinical improvement showed a significant decrease of previously increased gray matter in the midbrain including periaqueductal gray matter and nucleus cuneiformis, whereas patients without improvement did not. Patients without treatment response had less gray matter in the orbitofrontal cortex. Another striking result is the correlation of treatment response with the amount of orbitofrontal gray matter. Thus, we demonstrate adaptive gray matter changes within the pain modulatory system in patients with MOH who responded to detoxification, probably reflecting neuronal plasticity. Decreased gray matter in the orbitofrontal cortex at baseline may be predictive of poor response to treatment. ",

Even though these studies have examined the relationship between grey matter shrinkage and hypometabolism, none has performed a direct voxel-by-voxel comparison between the degrees of structural and metabolic abnormalities. Seventeen alcoholic patients and 16 control subjects underwent both structural magnetic resonance imaging and (18)F-2-fluoro-deoxy-glucose-positron emission tomography examinations. Structural abnormalities and hypometabolism were examined in alcoholic patients compared with control subjects using two-sample t-tests. Then, these two patterns of brain damage were directly compared with a paired t-test. Compared to controls, alcoholic patients had grey matter shrinkage and hypometabolism in the fronto-cerebellar circuit and several nodes of Papez's circuit. The direct comparison revealed greater shrinkage than hypometabolism in the cerebellum, cingulate cortex, thalamus and hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus. Conversely, hypometabolism was more severe than shrinkage in the dorsolateral, premotor and parietal cortices. The distinct profiles of abnormalities found within the Papez's circuit, the fronto-cerebellar circuit and the parietal gyrus in chronic alcoholism suggest the involvement of different pathological mechanisms.

Although involving basic perceptual and memory related processes, spatial navigation is particularly complex because it is a multisensory process in which information needs to be integrated and manipulated over time and space. Not surprisingly, humans differ widely in this ability, and recent animal and human work has begun to unveil the underlying mechanisms. Here, we consider three interdependent domains that have been related to navigational abilities: cognitive and perceptual factors, neural information processing and variability in brain microstructure. Together, the findings converge into an emerging model of how different factors interact to produce individual patterns of navigational performance. ",

However, whether this thalamo-cortical abnormality pattern is of genetic predisposition remains unknown. The present study for the first time aimed to investigate the common and distinct characteristics of this circuit in schizophrenia patients and their unaffected siblings who share half of the patient's genotype. Totally 293 participants were recruited into this study including 94 patients with schizophrenia, 96 their healthy siblings, and 103 healthy controls scanned using gradient-echo echo-planar imaging at rest. By using a fine-grained atlas of thalamus with 16 sub-regions, we mapped the thalamocortical network in three groups. Decreased thalamo-prefronto-cerebellar connectivity was shared between schizophrenia and their healthy siblings, but increased sensorimotor-thalamic connectivity was only found in schizophrenia. The shared thalamo-prefronto-cerebellar dysconnectivity showed an impressively gradient reduction pattern in patients and siblings comparing to controls: higher in the controls, lower in the patients and intermediate in the siblings. Anatomically, the decreased thalamic connectivity mostly centered on the pre-frontal thalamic subregions locating at the mediodorsal nucleus, while the increased functional connectivity with sensorimotor cortices was only observed in the caudal temporal thalamic subregion anchoring at the dorsal and ventral lateral nuclei. Moreover, both decreased thalamo-prefronto-cerebellar connectivity and increased sensorimotor-thalamic connectivity were related to clinical symptoms in patients. Our findings extend the evidence that the decreased thalamo-prefronto-cerebellar connectivity may be related to the high genetic risk in schizophrenia, while increased sensorimotor-thalamic connectivity potentially represents a neural biomarker for this severe mental disorder.

One neurological system proposed to underlie this function is the mirror neuron system (MNS) and previous research has suggested a dysfunctional MNS in ASD. The EEG mu frequency, more precisely the reduction of the mu power, is considered to be an index for mirror neuron functioning. In this work, EEG registrations are used to evaluate the mirror neuron functioning of twenty children with high functioning autism (HFA) between 8 and 13 years. Their mu suppression to self-executed and observed movement is compared to typically developing peers and related to age, intelligence and symptom severity. Both groups show significant mu suppression to both self and observed hand movements. No group differences are found in either condition. These results do not support the hypothesis that HFA is associated with a dysfunctional MNS. The discrepancy with previous research is discussed in light of the heterogeneity of the ASD population.

pmid_12604786,Neural deficits in children with dyslexia ameliorated by behavioral remediation: evidence from functional MRI.,,"Developmental dyslexia, characterized by unexplained difficulty in reading, is associated with behavioral deficits in phonological processing. Functional neuroimaging studies have shown a deficit in the neural mechanisms underlying phonological processing in children and adults with dyslexia. The present study examined whether behavioral remediation ameliorates these dysfunctional neural mechanisms in children with dyslexia. Functional MRI was performed on 20 children with dyslexia (8-12 years old) during phonological processing before and after a remediation program focused on auditory processing and oral language training. Behaviorally, training improved oral language and reading performance. Physiologically, children with dyslexia showed increased activity in multiple brain areas. Increases occurred in left temporo-parietal cortex and left inferior frontal gyrus, bringing brain activation in these regions closer to that seen in normal-reading children. Increased activity was observed also in right-hemisphere frontal and temporal regions and in the anterior cingulate gyrus. Children with dyslexia showed a correlation between the magnitude of increased activation in left temporo-parietal cortex and improvement in oral language ability. These results suggest that a partial remediation of language-processing deficits, resulting in improved reading, ameliorates disrupted function in brain regions associated with phonological processing and produces additional compensatory activation in other brain regions.

T2DM patients (n=28) were compared with nondiabetic age-, sex-, and education-matched control subjects (n=29) using rs-fMRI. We computed the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of fMRI signals to measure spontaneous neuronal activity and detect the relationship between rs-fMRI information and clinical data. Compared with healthy controls, T2DM patients had significantly decreased ALFF values in the bilateral middle temporal gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus, right inferior occipital gyrus; and increased ALFF values in both the bilateral cerebellum posterior lobe and right cerebellum culmen. Moreover, we found an inverse correlation between the ALFF values in the MTG and both the HbA1c (r=-0.451, p=0.016) and the score of Trail Making Test-B (r=-0.420, p=0.026) in the patient group. On the other hand, C-peptide level and pancreatic β-cell function had a positive correlation (r=0.429, p=0.023; r=0.453, p=0.016, respectively) with the ALFF value in the middle temporal gyrus. The present study confirms that T2DM patients have altered ALFF in many brain regions, which is associated with poor neurocognitive performances, severity of consistent hyperglycemic state and impaired β-cell function. ALFF disturbance in MTG may play a central role in cognitive decline associated with T2DM and serve as reference for future clinical diagnosis. ",

This study was aim to investigate the spontaneous brain activity and its relationship with memory performance in ESRD patients before dialysis (T1) and after 24 h (T2) during a single dialysis session. 23 ESRD patients and 25 matched healthy controls (HCs) were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at T1, and all patients were also scanned at T2. Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) methods were used to evaluate the spontaneous brain activity between two groups. The Auditory Verbal Learning Test-Huashan version (AVLT-H) was performed to assess memory function. Compared with HCs, ESRD group showed a significant decreases in the immediate recall total score (IR-S), short-term delayed recall score (SR-S), and long-term delayed recall score (LR-S) at T1. IR-S, SR-S, LR-S and recognition score (REC-S) were significantly increased at T2. Compared with HCs at T1, ESRD patients showed that the lower mean ALFF (mALFF) values were mainly located in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), medial frontal gyrus, and precuneus. Higher ReHo in the bilateral inferior temporal gyrus and left hippocampus and lower ReHo in the right precentral gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex were found at T1 too. The mALFF values of the DLPFC and precuneus were significantly increased during a dialysis session, while no significantly difference of ReHo region was found. Furthermore, the increased mALFF values of the DLPFC were significantly positively correlated with the improvement in the IR-S. Our results indicated that increased regional spontaneous activity of the DLPFC may reflect memory performance improvement after a single dialysis treatment, which may provide insight into the effect of hemodialysis on spontaneous brain function during a single dialysis session.

Voxel-based morphometry","Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has a high prevalence of co-occurring with emotion dysregulation (ED). Youths with ADHD and ED are more likely to have increased functional impairment. There is accumulating research on defining the features, behavioral, and physiological manifestations of ED, but there are currently few studies elucidating neuroanatomical correlations of ED in ADHD. Structural magnetic resonance imaging data from 118 children (aged 7-18 years) with ADHD (50 ADHD+high ED, 68 ADHD+low ED), and 104 typically developing controls (TDC) were processed using voxel-based morphometry. We used both dichotomous and continuous indices of ED to examine the possible correspondence between ED and ADHD. Relative to ADHD+high ED, ADHD+low ED had greater gray matter (GM) volumes over the left anterior prefrontal cortex (PFC). ADHD+low ED and ADHD+high ED shared a negative association of ED levels with the left middle temporal pole GM volume. TDC and ADHD+low ED also shared negative relationships of ED levels with the right temporal volume, and positive relationships with the left dorsolateral PFC volume. Besides, ED-by-group interactions were also noted. Specifically, medial PFC GM volumes increased and decreased with ED severity in ADHD+low ED and ADHD+high ED, respectively; and left cerebellum Crus GM volumes decreased and increased with ED severity in ADHD+low ED and ADHD+high ED, respectively. Our findings add to the evidence that some specific neural correlates are underpinning ED across ADHD and TDC. These findings suggest the importance of incorporating ED problems when considering heterogeneity in studies of ADHD. ",

Striatum","The brain reward circuitry innervated by dopamine is critically disturbed in schizophrenia. This study aims to investigate the role of dopamine-related brain activity during prediction of monetary reward and loss in first episode schizophrenia patients. We measured blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) activity in 10 patients with schizophrenia (SCH) and 12 healthy controls during dopamine depletion with α-methylparatyrosine (AMPT) and during a placebo condition (PLA). AMPT reduced the activation of striatal and cortical brain regions in SCH. In SCH vs. controls reduced activation was found in the AMPT condition in several regions during anticipation of reward and loss, including areas of the striatum and frontal cortex. In SCH vs. controls reduced activation of the superior temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate was observed in PLA during anticipation of rewarding stimuli. PLA patients had reduced activation in the ventral striatum, frontal and cingulate cortex in anticipation of loss. The findings of reduced dopamine-related brain activity during AMPT were verified by reduced levels of dopamine in urine, homovanillic-acid in plasma and increased prolactin levels. Our results indicate that dopamine depletion affects functioning of the cortico-striatal reward circuitry in SCH. The findings also suggest that neuronal functions associated with dopamine neurotransmission and attribution of salience to reward predicting stimuli are altered in schizophrenia. ",

Stroop","Despite the high prevalence and consequences associated with externalizing psychopathologies, little is known about their underlying neurobiological mechanisms. Studying multiple externalizing disorders, each characterized by compromised inhibition, could reveal both common and distinct mechanisms of impairment. The present study therefore compared individuals with intermittent explosive disorder (IED) (N = 11), individuals with cocaine use disorder (CUD) (N = 21), and healthy controls (N = 17) on task performance and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity during an event-related color-word Stroop task; self-reported trait anger expression was also collected in all participants. Results revealed higher error-related activity in the two externalizing psychopathologies as compared with controls in two subregions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (a region known to be involved in exerting cognitive control during this task), suggesting a neural signature of inhibitory-related error processing common to these psychopathologies. Interestingly, in one DLPFC subregion, error-related activity was especially high in IED, possibly indicating a specific neural correlate of clinically high anger expression. Supporting this interpretation, error-related DLPFC activity in this same subregion positively correlated with trait anger expression across all participants. These collective results help to illuminate common and distinct neural signatures of impaired self-control, and could suggest novel therapeutic targets for increasing self-control in clinical aggression specifically and/or in various externalizing psychopathologies more generally.

pmid_21601433,Atypical modulation of medial prefrontal cortex to self-referential comments in generalized social phobia.,,"Generalized social phobia (GSP) involves the fear of being negatively evaluated. Previous work suggests that self-referentiality, mediated by the medial prefrontal cortex (MFPC), plays an important role in the disorder. However, it is not clear whether this anomalous MPFC response to self-related information in patients with GSP concerns an increased representation of their own or others' opinions. In this article, we examine whether GSP is associated with increased response to own (1st person) or other individuals' (2nd person) opinions relative to healthy individuals. Unmedicated individuals with GSP (n=15) and age-, IQ-, and gender-matched comparison individuals (n=15) read 1st (e.g., I'm ugly), and 2nd (e.g., You're ugly) person viewpoint comments during functional magnetic resonance imaging. We observed significant group-by-viewpoint interactions within the ventral MPFC. Whereas the healthy comparison individuals showed significantly increased (or less decreased) BOLD responses to 1st relative to 2nd person viewpoints, the patients showed significantly increased responses to 2nd relative to 1st person viewpoints. The reduced BOLD responses to 1st person viewpoint comments shown by the patients correlated significantly with severity of social anxiety symptom severity. These results underscore the importance of dysfunctional self-referential processing and MPFC in GSP. We believe that these data reflect a reorganization of self-referential reasoning in the disorder with a self-concept perhaps atypically related to the view of others. ",

movement planning
parieto-frontal network","The planning of goal-directed arm reaching movements is associated with activity in the dorsal parieto-frontal cortex, within which multiple regions subserve the integration of arm- and target-related sensory signals to encode a motor goal. Surprisingly, many of these regions show sustained activity during reach preparation even when target location is not specified, i.e., when a motor goal cannot be unambiguously formed. The functional role of these non-spatial preparatory signals remains unresolved. Here this process was investigated in humans by comparing reach preparatory activity in the presence or absence of information regarding upcoming target location. In order to isolate the processes specific to reaching and to control for visuospatial attentional factors, the reaching task was contrasted to a finger movement task. Functional MRI and electroencephalography (EEG) were used to characterize the spatio-temporal pattern of reach-related activity in the parieto-frontal cortex. Reach planning with advance knowledge of target location induced robust blood oxygenated level dependent and EEG responses across parietal and premotor regions contralateral to the reaching arm. In contrast, reach preparation without knowledge of target location was associated with a significant BOLD response bilaterally in the parietal cortex. Furthermore, EEG alpha- and beta-band activity was restricted to parietal scalp sites, the magnitude of the latter being correlated with reach reaction times. These results suggest an intermediate stage of sensorimotor transformations in bilateral parietal cortex when target location is not specified. ",

In this paper, we review recent progress on the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on resting-state fMRI. First, we briefly introduce some AD-related studies from other groups. Then we describe our AD-related work in detail from three aspects: (1) alterations in regional homogeneity (ReHo) of the fMRI signal in the resting state, (2) altered patterns of functional connectivity from regions of interest and whole brain analyses, and (3) discriminative analyses based on classification features from resting-state fMRI data for differentiating AD patients from healthy elders. Finally, we summarize the main results and some prospects for future work. ",
pmid_11713630,Relationship between saccadic eye movements and cortical activity as measured by fMRI: quantitative and qualitative aspects.,,"We investigated the quantitative relationship between saccadic activity (as reflected in frequency of occurrence and amplitude of saccades) and blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) changes in the cerebral cortex using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Furthermore, we investigated quantitative changes in cortical activity associated with qualitative changes in the saccade task for comparable levels of saccadic activity. All experiments required the simultaneous acquisition of eye movement and fMRI data. For this purpose we used a new high-resolution limbus-tracking technique for recording eye movements in the magnetic resonance tomograph. In the first two experimental series we varied both frequency and amplitude of saccade stimuli (target jumps). In the third series we varied task difficulty; subjects performed either pro-saccades or anti-saccades. The brain volume investigated comprised the frontal and supplementary eye fields, parietal as well as striate cortex, and the motion sensitive area of the parieto-occipital cortex. All these regions showed saccade-related BOLD responses. The responses in these regions were highly correlated with saccade frequency, indicating that repeated processing of saccades is integrated over time in the BOLD response. In contrast, there was no comparable BOLD change with variation of saccade amplitude. This finding speaks for a topological rather than activity-dependent coding of saccade amplitudes in most cortical regions. In the experiments comparing pro- vs anti-saccades we found higher BOLD activation in the ""anti"" task than in the ""pro"" task. A comparison of saccade parameters revealed that saccade frequency and cumulative amplitude were comparable between the two tasks, whereas reaction times were longer in the ""anti"" task than the pro task. The latter finding is taken to indicate a more demanding cortical processing in the ""anti"" task than the ""pro"" task, which could explain the observed difference in BOLD activation. We hold that a quantitative analysis of saccade parameters (especially saccade frequency and latency) is important for the interpretation of the BOLD changes observed with visual stimuli in fMRI. ",
pmid_18684074,The human brain response to acupuncture on same-meridian acupoints: evidence from an fMRI study.,,"Stimulation of acupuncture points (acupoints) located on meridians has been proven to activate specific areas of the human brain, as evidenced by functional imaging studies. To date, the specificity of acupoints located on different meridians has been investigated with functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI). The present fMRI study explored the effects of stimulating 4 acupoints on 2 different meridians for the purpose of researching the characteristic response of acupoints on the same meridian. The acupoints studied were LR3 (Taichong) and LR6 (Zhongdu), which belong to the Liver meridian of Foot-Jueyin; ST36 (Zusanli) and ST43 (Xiangu), which belong to the Stomach meridian of Foot-Yangming; and 2 nearby sham acupoints. Fifty-three (53) healthy right-handed subjects were divided randomly into 6 groups. Each group only received acupuncture at one acupoint. All the acupoints in this study were stimulated only on the right side of the subject's body. Through analysis of fMRI data from all subjects, we obtained the activation patterns in the central nervous system (CNS) evoked by acupuncture. In contrast to the CNS activation by sham acupoint, the results showed that all 4 real acupoints under consideration had the common effect of activating 2 specific areas of the brain: the bilateral primary somatosensory area and the ipsilateral cerebellum. Acupuncture stimulation of both acupoints LR3 and LR6 evoked activation at the ipsilateral superior parietal lobe (BA7). Acupuncture stimulation of both acupoints ST36 and ST43 evoked activation at the ipsilateral middle frontal gyrus (BA10). These results suggest that different acupoints on the same meridian may activate certain similar areas of the brain. In addition, acupoints that are commonly used in clinical practice might modulate a greater extent of cortical areas than uncommonly used acupoints. ",

The resting state brain function of 30 patients with left KOA was scanned with fMRI before and after treatment with moxibustion. The analytic methods of fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (fALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) were used to observe changes in resting state brain function. The fALFF values of the right cerebrum, extra-nucleus, left cerebellum, left cerebrum and white matter of patients after moxibustion treatment were higher than before treatment, and the fALFF values of the precentral gyrus, frontal lobe and occipital lobe were lower than before treatment (P < 0.05, K > or = 85). The ReHo values of the thalamus, extra-nucleus and parietal lobe of patients were much higher than those before moxibustion treatment, and the ReHo values of the right cerebrum, left cerebrum and frontal lobe were lower than before treatment (P < 0.05, K > or = 85). The influence of moxibustion on obvious changes in brain regions basically conforms to the way that pain and warmth is transmitted in the body, and the activation of sensitive systems in the body may be objective evidence of channel transmission. The regulation of brain function by moxibustion is not in a single brain region but rather in a network of many brain regions. ",

Rats of the CLP, CLP+EA and CLP+Sham-EA groups underwent CLP modeling of sepsis; those in the Sham-CLP underwent sham surgery and those in the Control and Control+EA groups remained unoperated. Rats in the CLP+EA and Control+EA groups received verum EA at ST36 and rats in the CLP+Sham-EA groups received EA at non-traditional acupuncture points. After three days, serum D-lactate concentrations were measured and ileal mucosa was collected for haematoxylin and eosin staining, morphological observation and Chiu's scoring. The intestinal epithelial cells were observed under transmission electron microscopy (TEM), while protein expression of occludin was measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. TJs of the Control, Sham-CLP and Control+EA groups were continuous under TEM but discontinuous in the CLP, CLP+EA and CLP+Sham-EA groups. Plasma D-lactate levels were significantly higher in the CLP, CLP+EA and CLP+Sham-EA groups compared with the Control, Sham-CLP and Control+EA groups (P<0.01). Protein expression of occludin, reflected by immunohistochemistry scores (IHS) and the results of Western blotting, were significantly reduced in the CLP, CLP+EA and CLP+Sham-EA groups when compared with the Control, Sham-CLP and Control+EA groups (P<0.01). Compared with the CLP group, the IHS and Western blotting results of the CLP+EA group were both significantly higher (P<0.05), while those of the CLP+Sham-EA group were similar to the CLP group. Electrical stimulation at ST36 in rats with sepsis can increase protein expression of occludin, reduce serum D-lactate levels and increase permeability of the intestinal barrier. ",

Seventeen studies were included in the systematic review, total of 200 major depression participants (mean age 37.6 years), all medication free, and 116 healthy controls (mean age 36.4 years). Neuroimaging assessments were performed prior to initiation of treatment and following course of treatment. Treatment durations were: 16-30 weeks for CBT, 11 weeks for behavioral activation therapy, and up to 15 months for psychodynamic psychotherapy. The meta-analysis consisted of studies in which both groups had same serial scans and comparable tasks; total of 5 studies with visual presentation tasks of emotional stimuli: 55 patients (mean age: 38.7 years) and 55 healthy controls (mean age: 36.3 years). The meta-analysis revealed a significant group by time effect in left rostral anterior cingulate, in which patients showed increased activity following psychotherapy while healthy controls showed a decrease at follow up. Longitudinal treatment effects revealed reduced left precentral cortical activity in major depression. Findings could be indicative of improvements in emotion responsivity that may be achieved following psychotherapy. ",
pmid_23867619,"A link between FTO, ghrelin, and impaired brain food-cue responsivity.",,"Polymorphisms in the fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) are associated with human obesity and obesity-prone behaviors, including increased food intake and a preference for energy-dense foods. FTO demethylates N6-methyladenosine, a potential regulatory RNA modification, but the mechanisms by which FTO predisposes humans to obesity remain unclear. In adiposity-matched, normal-weight humans, we showed that subjects homozygous for the FTO ""obesity-risk"" rs9939609 A allele have dysregulated circulating levels of the orexigenic hormone acyl-ghrelin and attenuated postprandial appetite reduction. Using functional MRI (fMRI) in normal-weight AA and TT humans, we found that the FTO genotype modulates the neural responses to food images in homeostatic and brain reward regions. Furthermore, AA and TT subjects exhibited divergent neural responsiveness to circulating acyl-ghrelin within brain regions that regulate appetite, reward processing, and incentive motivation. In cell models, FTO overexpression reduced ghrelin mRNA N6-methyladenosine methylation, concomitantly increasing ghrelin mRNA and peptide levels. Furthermore, peripheral blood cells from AA human subjects exhibited increased FTO mRNA, reduced ghrelin mRNA N6-methyladenosine methylation, and increased ghrelin mRNA abundance compared with TT subjects. Our findings show that FTO regulates ghrelin, a key mediator of ingestive behavior, and offer insight into how FTO obesity-risk alleles predispose to increased energy intake and obesity in humans.

Although abnormal frontostriatal structure and function have been observed in individuals addicted to cocaine, it is less clear how individual variability in brain structure is associated with brain function to influence behavior. Our objective was to examine frontostriatal structure and neural processing of money value in chronic cocaine users and closely matched healthy controls. A reward task that manipulated different levels of money was used to isolate neural activity associated with money value. Gray matter volume measures were used to assess frontostriatal structure. Our results indicated that cocaine users had an abnormal money value signal in the sensorimotor striatum (right putamen/globus pallidus) that was negatively associated with accuracy adjustments to money and was more pronounced in individuals with more severe use. In parallel, group differences were also observed in both the function and gray matter volume of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex; in the cocaine users, the former was directly associated with response to money in the striatum. These results provide strong evidence for abnormalities in the neural mechanisms of valuation in addiction and link these functional abnormalities with deficits in brain structure. In addition, as value signals represent acquired associations, their abnormal processing in the sensorimotor striatum, a region centrally implicated in habit formation, could signal disadvantageous associative learning in cocaine addiction.

While the pathogenesis of ALS remains largely unknown, imaging studies of the brain should lead to more insight into structural and functional disease effects on the brain network, which may provide valuable information on the underlying disease process. This study investigates the correlation between changes in structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) of the brain network in ALS. Structural reconstructions of the brain network, derived from diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), were obtained from 64 patients and 27 healthy controls. Functional interactions between brain regions were derived from resting-state fMRI. Our results show that (i) the most structurally affected connections considerably overlap with the most functionally impaired connections, (ii) direct connections of the motor cortex are both structurally and functionally more affected than connections at greater topological distance from the motor cortex, and (iii) there is a strong positive correlation between changes in SC and FC averaged per brain region (r = 0.44, P < 0.0001). Our findings indicate that structural and functional network degeneration in ALS is coupled, suggesting the pathogenic process affects both SC and FC of the brain, with the most prominent effects in SC.

Twenty-eight participants with IAD and twenty-eight healthy age and gender matched controls participated in the study. Brain morphology of adolescents with IGD and healthy controls was investigated using an optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM) technique. Cognitive control performances were measured by Stroop task, and correlation analysis was performed between brain structural change and behavioral performance in IGD group. The results showed that GMV of the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), precuneus, supplementary motor area (SMA), superior parietal cortex, left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), left insula, and bilateral cerebellum decreased in the IGD participants compared with healthy controls. Moreover, GMV of the ACC was negatively correlated with the incongruent response errors of Stroop task in IGD group.

Here, we seek to determine if abnormalities specific to interictal MA patients exist in functional brain connectivity of intrinsic cognitive networks. In particular, these networks are involved in top-down modulation of visual processing. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, whole-brain functional connectivity maps were derived from seeds placed in the anterior insula and the middle frontal gyrus, key nodes of the salience and dorsal attention networks, respectively. Twenty-six interictal MA patients were compared with 26 matched MO patients and 26 healthy matched controls. The major findings were: connectivity between the anterior insula and occipital areas, including area V3A, was reduced in MA but not in MO. Connectivity changes between the anterior insula and occipital areas further correlated with the headache severity in MA only. The unique pattern of connectivity changes found in interictal MA patients involved area V3A, an area previously implicated in aura generation. Hypoconnectivity to this and other occipital regions may either represent a compensatory response to occipital dysfunctions or predispose MA patients to the development of aura. ",

Despite the wealth of research in this field, the exact functional nature and different topological features of these neural networks remain elusive. Here, we addressed both using a well-established data-driven meta-analytic grouping approach. We applied k-means clustering to a large set of previously published experiments investigating emotion regulation (independent of strategy, goal and stimulus type) to segregate the results of these experiments into large-scale networks. To elucidate the functional nature of these distinct networks, we used functional decoding of metadata terms (i.e. task-level descriptions and behavioral domains). We identified four large-scale brain networks. The first two were related to regulation and functionally characterized by a stronger focus on response inhibition or executive control versus appraisal or language processing. In contrast, the second two networks were primarily related to emotion generation, appraisal, and physiological processes. We discuss how our findings corroborate and inform contemporary models of emotion regulation and thereby significantly add to the literature. ",

PASAT is sensitive to subtle cognitive impairment related to MS, although the cognitive components of this test still remain unclear. In order to better characterize brain systems involved during this complex task, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments were conducted during PASAT in a population of ten normal subjects. The paradigm consisted of a series of 61 single-digit numbers delivered every 3 s. After each number, subjects were asked to overt vocalize the result of the addition of the two last numbers heard. A control task consisting of the repetition of the same series of single-digit numbers was used. Statistical group analysis was performed using the random effect procedure (SPM 99). Cortical activation was observed in the left prefrontal cortex, the supplementary motor area, the lateral premotor cortex, the cingulate gyrus, the left parietal lobe, the left superior temporal gyrus, the left temporal pole, and visual associative areas. fMRI activations underlying PASAT were consistent with an involvement of verbal working memory and the semantic memory retrieval network which could be related to arithmetic fact retrieval. This study on normal subjects could provide a base for the understanding of the potential abnormal cortical activation in MS patients performing this test for a cognitive evaluation. ",

This study aims to investigate whether the inconsistent voxel-based morphometry (VBM) findings in schizophrenia are due to the use of different software packages. T1 MRI images were obtained from 86 first-episode schizophrenia (FESZ) patients and 86 age- and gender-matched Healthy controls (HCs). VBM analysis was carried out using FMRIB software library (FSL) 5.0 and statistical parametric mapping 8 (SPM8). All images were processed using the default parameter settings as provided by these software packages. FSL-VBM revealed widespread GM volume reductions in FESZ patients compared with HCs, however, for SPM-VBM, only increased and circumscribed GM volume changes were found, both software revealed increased GM volume within cerebellum. Significant correlations between Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and GM volume were mainly found in frontal regions.

Emotion morphs depicted expression changes from neutral to fear or anger, creating the illusion that the actor was 'getting scared' or 'getting angry' in real-time. Brain regions implicated in processing facial affect, including the amygdala and fusiform gyrus, showed greater responses to dynamic versus static emotional expressions, especially for fear. Identity morphs activated a dorsal fronto-cingulo-parietal circuit and additional ventral areas, including the amygdala, that also responded to the emotion morphs. Activity in the superior temporal sulcus discriminated emotion morphs from identity morphs, extending its known role in processing biologically relevant motion. The results highlight the importance of temporal cues in the neural coding of facial displays. ",

Connectivity analyses between subcortical regions and other brain areas were performed using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging among the groups. Whole brain and total cortical gray matter, right fusiform gyrus, left pars orbitalis gyrus, right pars triangularis, left superior temporal gyrus and left insula volumes, and bilateral cortical thickness were decreased in the deteriorated group compared to the control and preserved groups. Both schizophrenia subgroups had increased left lateral ventricle, right putamen and left pallidum, and decreased bilateral hippocampus, left precentral gyrus, right rostral middle frontal gyrus, and bilateral superior frontal gyrus volumes compared with controls. Hyperconnectivity between the thalamus and a broad range of brain regions was observed in the deteriorated group compared to connectivity in the control group, and this hyperconnectivity was less evident in the preserved group. We also found hyperconnectivity between the accumbens and the superior and middle frontal gyri in the preserved group compared with connectivity in the deteriorated group. These findings provide evidence of prominent structural and functional brain abnormalities in deteriorated patients with schizophrenia, suggesting that cognitive subgroups in schizophrenia might be useful biotypes to elucidate brain pathophysiology for new diagnostic and treatment strategies.

To assess the motoric aspects of rehearsal in the absence of working memory, we asked the subjects to repeatedly read subvocally six or one letters at a rate that approximated the internally generated rehearsal of working memory (motoric rehearsal task). For both tasks, bilateral regions of the superior cerebellar hemispheres (left superior HVIIA and right HVI) and portions of posterior vermis (VI and superior VIIA) exhibited increased activation during high relative to low load conditions. In contrast, the right inferior cerebellar hemisphere (HVIIB) exhibited this load effect only during the working-memory task. We hypothesize that HVI and superior HVIIA activation represents input from the articulatory control system of working memory from the frontal lobes and that HVIIB activation is derived from the phonological store in temporal and parietal regions. From these inputs, the cerebellum could compute the discrepancy between actual and intended phonological rehearsal and use this information to update a feedforward command to the frontal lobes, thereby facilitating the phonological loop.

pmid_31637009,History and progress of hypotheses and clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease.,"Neurological disorders
Neuroscience","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive memory loss along with neuropsychiatric symptoms and a decline in activities of daily life. Its main pathological features are cerebral atrophy, amyloid plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles in the brains of patients. There are various descriptive hypotheses regarding the causes of AD, including the cholinergic hypothesis, amyloid hypothesis, tau propagation hypothesis, mitochondrial cascade hypothesis, calcium homeostasis hypothesis, neurovascular hypothesis, inflammatory hypothesis, metal ion hypothesis, and lymphatic system hypothesis. However, the ultimate etiology of AD remains obscure. In this review, we discuss the main hypotheses of AD and related clinical trials. Wealthy puzzles and lessons have made it possible to develop explanatory theories and identify potential strategies for therapeutic interventions for AD. The combination of hypometabolism and autophagy deficiency is likely to be a causative factor for AD. We further propose that fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, has the potential to treat AD. ",
pmid_22640382,Differential brain activation during response inhibition in bipolar and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders.,,"To identify differential patterns of brain activation between adolescents with bipolar disorder and adolescents with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to better understand the neurophysiology of both disorders. We hypothesized that subjects with ADHD would show altered activation in brain regions involved in executive and sustained attention. In contrast, we hypothesized that bipolar subjects would show altered brain activation in regions responsible for emotionally homeostasis, including the striatum and amygdala. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed during a continuous performance task with a response inhibition component in 11 adolescents with bipolar disorder during a manic episode, 10 adolescents with ADHD, and 13 healthy adolescents. There were no differences in behavioural performance among the three groups. Compared with bipolar subjects, subjects with ADHD showed increased activation in the superior temporal lobe during successful response inhibition. Although bipolar subjects did not show activation differences in the striatum or amygdala compared with ADHD subjects, increased left parahippocampal activation in the bipolar group was associated with increased manic symptoms. The patterns of brain activation observed in the current study support divergent patterns of neurophysiological dysfunction in individuals with bipolar disorder as compared with those with ADHD. Therefore, the impulsive behaviour seen in both disorders may be the consequence of dysfunction in different brain regions, and further research may help identify neurobiological markers that are specific to each condition.

pmid_15511653,The influence of working memory load on phase specific patterns of cortical activity.,,"This study investigated patterns of cortical activity associated with the temporally separated encoding, maintenance and retrieval phases of a working memory (WM) task. Eighteen healthy subjects completed a variable load version of the Sternberg Item Recognition Task. Brain regions showing activity on average across load were determined for each task phase. In addition, brain regions showing activity that increased linearly with load were determined for encoding and retrieval. Although previous fMRI studies have used event-related designs to isolate phase specific activity, this study differed in that design and analysis methods were optimized to ensure low multicollinearity between the conditions of interest: the duration of the intermediate phase (maintenance) was varied and load was selectively modeled for the encoding and retrieval phases. The brain areas showing activity on average across load for each phase combine to encompass regions identified in previous studies that have not attempted to separate phase specific activity. Encoding is associated with extensive load dependent activity, with the most robust activity in bilateral occipital and posterior parietal regions. Retrieval is associated with more selective load dependent activity, primarily in the anterior supplementary motor region and the right posterior cerebellum. The analysis strategies employed in this study could be used to further delineate the phases of WM that are most severely compromised in clinical populations with WM disturbances. ",

Task-fMRI","Previous task-fMRI studies have reported the abnormal brain activations in major depressive disorders (MDD) with suicidal behavior. However, there is no consensus of opinion on task-fMRI imaging findings of the suicidal brain. We performed a meta-analysis to integrate the results of reported studies to find the consistent task-related alteration pattern of brain activations in MDD patients with suicidal behavior, aiming to investigate brain functional alterations in association with a vulnerability to suicidal behavior. Using the SDM (Seed-based d Mapping) method, we conducted a meta-analysis of the task-fMRI studies to compare the brain activations between major depressive disorder (MDD) patients with a history of suicidal behavior (suicide attempter, ATT) and the MDD patients without suicidal behavior (non-attempters, NAT) during tasks. Our systematic search identified 7 task-fMRI studies comprising 366 individuals, i.e., 150 ATT and 216 NAT. We found that brain activation in ATT increased in the left insula, while decreased in the bilateral fusiform gyrus compared to NAT during the fMRI tasks. We found the brain activation changes in the insula and fusiform gyrus in MDD patients with a history of suicide attempt during fMRI tasks. The brain activation changes in these regions were associated with the dysfunction of emotion regulation, processing negative information and self-awareness which may increase the vulnerability of suicidal behavior in MDD patients.

Neuroimaging studies particularly focused on the neural substrates of social exclusion in healthy subjects (HC), borderline personality disorder (BPD), and major depression (MD). However, there is evidence regarding neural alterations also during social inclusion in BPD that we intended to elucidate in our study. Considering that patients with BPD often have comorbid MD, we investigated patients with BPD, and comorbid MD, patients with MD without BPD, and a sample of HC. By investigating these two clinical samples within one study design, we attempted to disentangle potential confounds arising by psychiatric disorder or medication and to relate neural alterations under social inclusion specifically to BPD. We investigated 48 females (15 BPD and MD, 16 MD, and 17 HC) aged between 18 and 40 years by fMRI (3T), using the established cyberball paradigm with social exclusion, inclusion, and passive watching conditions.

pmid_7846080,Functional neuroanatomy of antisaccade eye movements investigated with positron emission tomography.,,"Increasing interest in the role of the frontal lobe in relation to psychiatric and neurologic disorders has popularized tests of frontal function. One of these is the antisaccade task, in which both frontal lobe patients and schizophrenics are impaired despite normal performance on (pro)saccadic tasks. We used position emission tomography to examine the cerebral blood flow changes associated with the performance of antisaccades in normal individuals. We found that the areas of the brain that were more active during antisaccades than saccades were highly consistent with the oculomotor circuit, including frontal eye fields (FEFs), supplementary motor area, thalamus, and putamen. Superior parietal lobe and primary visual cortex were also significantly more active. In contrast, prefrontal areas 46 and 9 were not more active during antisaccades than during saccades. Performance of some frontal patients on the antisaccade task has been likened to a bradykinesia, or the inability to initiate a willed movement. It is the necessity to will the movement and inhibit competing responses that intuitively linked this task to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in frontal patients. Our data suggest that it is the FEFs in prefrontal cortex that differentiate between conditions in which the required oculomotor response changes while the stimulus remains the same, rather than areas 46 and 9, which, in human studies, have been linked to the performance of complex cognitive tasks. Such a conclusion is consistent with single-unit studies of nonhuman primates that have found that the FEFs, the executive portion of the oculomotor circuit, can trigger, inhibit, and set the target of saccades.

pmid_17060365,Grammatical categories in the brain: the role of morphological structure.,,"The current study addresses the controversial issue of how different grammatical categories are neurally processed. Several lesion-deficit studies suggest that distinct neural substrates underlie the representation of nouns and verbs, with verb deficits associated with damage to left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) and noun deficits with damage to left temporal cortex. However, this view is not universally shared by neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies. We have suggested that these inconsistencies may reflect interactions between the morphological structure of nouns and verbs and the processing implications of this, rather than differences in their neural representations (Tyler et al. 2004). We tested this hypothesis using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, to scan subjects performing a valence judgment on unambiguous nouns and verbs, presented as stems ('snail, hear') and inflected forms ('snails, hears'). We predicted that activations for noun and verb stems would not differ, whereas inflected verbs would generate more activation in left frontotemporal areas than inflected nouns. Our findings supported this hypothesis, with greater activation of this network for inflected verbs compared with inflected nouns. These results support the claim that form class is not a first-order organizing principle underlying the representation of words but rather interacts with the processes that operate over lexical representations.

spinal manipulative therapy","Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is one of the leading causes of low-back pain and results in a series of clinical symptoms, including pain, reflex loss, and muscle weakness. Spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) can relieve pain and promote internal and external stabilization of the lumbar spine. In this study, we investigated whether the brain alterations of LDH patients with SMT were frequency-dependent based on the calculation of Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF). Further, we established a cohort of LDH patients to evaluate the contribution of SMT treatments to brain functional reorganization. A total of 55 participants, including 27 LDH patients and 28 health controls (HCs), were collected. All LDH patients underwent two fMRI scans (before SMT and after the sixth SMT session). To represent LDH-related brain oscillatory activities, we calculated the ALFF and fALFF in the conventional band (0.01-0.08 Hz), the slow-4 band (0.027-0.073 Hz), and the slow-5 band (0.01-0.027 Hz). Moreover, we extracted ALFF and fALFF values in clusters with significant differences to evaluate the SMT effect. Compared with HCs, the LDH patients before SMT (LDH-pre) exhibited increased fALFF in right lingual gyri in the conventional band, and showed increased fALFF in left Cerebelum_Crus1 in the slow-4 band. We further examined the abnormal brain activities changes before and after the SMT intervention. The ALFF and fALFF values of LDH-pre group were higher than those of the HCs and LDH-pos groups. After SMT, the increased ALFF and fALFF values were suppressed for patients in conventional band and slow-4 band. The present study characterized the altered regional patterns in spontaneous neural activity in patients with LDH. Meanwhile, SMT is an effective treatment of LDH, and we supposed that it might have been involved in modulating dysfunctional brain regions which are important for the processing of pain. The findings of the current study may provide new insights to understand pathological mechanism of LDH. ",

pmid_23074077,Stimulating creativity via the exposure to other people's ideas.,,"As it is the case in brainstorming, each single idea a person generates to a specific problem may stimulate new ideas or solutions in others. In this fMRI study, we investigate the effects of cognitive stimulation via the exposure to other people's ideas on the originality of generated ideas. Participants are requested to generate alternative uses of conventional everyday objects subsequent to a short cognitive stimulation intervention in which they are exposed to other ideas, which were either common or highly original. In a control condition, meaningless pseudowords are shown. Results suggest that cognitive stimulation via common or moderately creative ideas was effective in improving creativity. At the neurophysiological level, temporo-parietal brain regions (primarily right-hemispheric) turned out to be particularly sensitive to cognitive stimulation, possibly indicating that cognitive stimulation via relevant memory cues results in a state of heightened focused attention to memory that facilitates efficient retrieval and recombination of existing knowledge.

voxel-based morphometry","Recent studies suggested that internet gaming disorder (IGD) was associated with impulsivity and structural abnormalities in brain gray matter (GM). However, no morphometric study has examined the association between GM and impulsivity in IGD individuals. In this study, 25 adolescents with IGD and 27 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited, and the relationship between Barratt impulsiveness scale-11 (BIS) score and gray matter volume (GMV) was investigated with the voxel-based morphometric (VBM) correlation analysis. Then, the intergroup differences in correlation between BIS score and GMV were tested across all GM voxels. Our results showed that the correlations between BIS score and GMV of the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), the bilateral insula and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the right amygdala and the left fusiform gyrus decreased in the IGD group compared to the HCs. Region-of-interest (ROI) analysis revealed that GMV in all these clusters showed significant positive correlations with BIS score in the HCs, while no significant correlation was found in the IGD group. Our findings demonstrated that dysfunction of these brain areas involved in the behavior inhibition, attention and emotion regulation might contribute to impulse control problems in IGD adolescents.

pmid_17601709,Fronto-limbic dysfunction in response to facial emotion in borderline personality disorder: an event-related fMRI study.,,"Clinical hallmarks of borderline personality disorder (BPD) include social and emotional dysregulation. We tested a model of fronto-limbic dysfunction in facial emotion processing in BPD. Groups of 12 unmedicated adults with BPD by DSM-IV and 12 demographically-matched healthy controls (HC) viewed facial expressions (Conditions) of neutral emotion, fear and anger, and made gender discriminations during rapid event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Analysis of variance of Region of Interest signal change revealed a statistically significant effect of the Group-by-Region-by-Condition interaction. This was due to the BPD group exhibiting a significantly larger magnitude of deactivation (relative to HC) in the bilateral rostral/subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to fear and in the left ACC to fear minus neutral; and significantly greater activation in the right amygdala to fear minus neutral. There were no significant between-group differences in ROI signal change in response to anger. In voxel-wise analyses constrained within these ROIs, the BPD group exhibited significant changes in the fear minus neutral contrast, with relatively less activation in the bilateral rostral/subgenual ACC, and greater activation in the right amygdala. In the anger minus neutral contrast this pattern was reversed, with the BPD group showing greater activation in the bilateral rostral/subgenual ACC and less activation in the bilateral amygdala. We conclude that adults with BPD exhibit changes in fronto-limbic activity in the processing of fear stimuli, with exaggerated amygdala response and impaired emotion-modulation of ACC activity. The neural substrates underlying processing of anger may also be altered. These changes may represent an expression of the volumetric and serotonergic deficits observed in these brain areas in BPD.

pmid_23010311,A preliminary study of alterations in default network connectivity in post-traumatic stress disorder patients following recent trauma.,,"This study used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate whether functional connectivity is altered in people developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following recent trauma. Sixty-two participants who had experienced recent acute traumatic events underwent a 7.3 min resting fMRI scan within 2 days post accident. Of these, 22 participants were diagnosed with PTSD within 1 to 6 months. Nineteen age- and sex-matched subjects without PTSD were selected as the trauma-exposed control group. Posterior cingulate cortex connectivity was determined from 17 PTSD patients and 15 control subjects by investigating synchronic low-frequency fMRI signal fluctuations using a temporal correlation method. To assess the relationship between PTSD symptom severity and PCC connectivity, the contrast image representing areas correlated with the PCC was correlated with the 17 PTSD subjects' Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) scores at diagnosis. Compared with the control group, PTSD patients exhibited decreased functional connectivity in the right lingual and right middle temporal gyri, and left lingual/posterior cingulate cortex. The left inferior temporal gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus/insula, left medial frontal lobe/anterior cingulate cortex, and right medial frontal gyrus also showed increased connectivity within two days post accident. A negative correlation was found between PCC connectivity and CAPS scores in the left medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These results suggest that patients who develop PTSD exhibit different resting-state patterns of neuronal activity following recent trauma. Abnormal FC of mPFC may be a major risk factor predisposing patients to the development of PTSD. ",
pmid_17088334,A widespread distinct pattern of cerebral atrophy in patients with alcohol addiction revealed by voxel-based morphometry.,,"Patients with alcohol addiction show a number of transient or persistent neurological and psychiatric deficits. The complexity of these brain alterations suggests that several brain areas are involved, although the definition of the brain alteration patterns is not yet accomplished. To determine brain atrophy patterns in patients with alcohol dependence. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) was performed in 22 patients with alcohol dependence and in 22 healthy controls matched for age and sex. In patients with alcohol dependence, VBM of GM revealed a significant decrease in density (p<0.001) in the precentral gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, insular cortex, dorsal hippocampus, anterior thalamus and cerebellum compared with controls. Reduced density of WM was found in the periventricular area, pons and cerebellar pedunculi in patients with alcohol addiction. Our findings provide evidence that alcohol addiction is associated with altered density of GM and WM of specific brain regions. This supports the assumption that alcohol dependence is associated with both local GM dysfunction and altered brain connectivity. Also, VBM is an effective tool for in vivo investigation of cerebral atrophy in patients with alcohol addiction. ",

fMRI","One of the core features of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is re-experiencing trauma. The anterior insula (AI) has been proposed to play a crucial role in these intrusive experiences. However, the dynamic function of the AI in re-experiencing trauma and its putative modulation by effective therapy need to be specified. Thirty PTSD patients were enrolled and exposed to traumatic memory reactivation therapy. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans were acquired before and after treatment. To explore AI-directed influences over the rest of the brain, we referred to a mixed model using pre-/posttreatment Granger causality analysis seeded on the AI as a within-subject factor and treatment response as a between-subject factor. To further identify correlates of re-experiencing trauma, we investigated how intrusive severity affected (i) causality maps and (ii) the spatial stability of other intrinsic brain networks. We observed changes in AI-directed functional connectivity patterns in PTSD patients. Many within- and between-network causal paths were found to be less influenced by the AI after effective therapy. Insular influences were found to be positively correlated with re-experiencing symptoms, while they were linked with a stronger default mode network (DMN) and more unstable central executive network (CEN) connectivity. We showed that directed changes in AI signaling to the DMN and CEN at rest may underlie the degree of re-experiencing symptoms in PTSD. A positive response to treatment further induced changes in network-to-network anticorrelated patterns. Such findings may guide targeted neuromodulation strategies in PTSD patients not suitably improved by conventional treatment. ",

Based on heterogeneity of the IPL in structure, connection and function, we hypothesize that the resting-state functional connectivities (rsFCs) of the IPL subregions are differentially affected in schizophrenia. This study included 95 schizophrenia patients and 104 healthy controls. The IPL subregions were defined according to a previous in vivo connection-based parcellation study. We calculated the rsFC of each IPL subregion and compared them between the two groups while controlling for the effects of age, gender, and grey matter volume. Among the six subregions of the left IPL and the five subregions of the right IPL, only the bilateral PFm (a transition zone of the IPL) subregions exhibited abnormal rsFC in schizophrenia. Specifically, the left PFm showed increased rsFC with the bilateral lingual gyri in schizophrenia patients than in healthy controls. The right PFm exhibited increased rsFC with the right lingual gyrus and inferior occipital gyrus, and bilateral mid-cingulate and sensorimotor cortices in schizophrenia patients. These findings suggest a selective rsFC abnormality in the IPL subregions in schizophrenia, characterized by the increased rsFC between the PFm subregion of the IPL and the visual and sensorimotor areas.

pmid_23924467,Abnormal intrinsic brain activity in amnestic mild cognitive impairment revealed by amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation: a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study.,,"Previous studies have shown that brain functional activity in the resting state is impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. However, alterations in intrinsic brain activity patterns in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients are poorly understood. This study aimed to explore the differences in regional intrinsic activities throughout the whole brain between aMCI patients and controls. In the present study, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed on 18 amnestic MCI (aMCI) patients, 18 mild AD patients and 20 healthy elderly subjects. And amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) method was used. Compared with healthy elderly subjects, aMCI patients showed decreased ALFF in the right hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex, left lateral temporal cortex, and right ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) and increased ALFF in the left temporal-parietal junction (TPJ) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Mild AD patients showed decreased ALFF in the left TPJ, posterior IPL (pIPL), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared with aMCI patients. Mild AD patients also had decreased ALFF in the right posterior cingulate cortex, right vMPFC and bilateral dorsal MPFC (dMPFC) compared with healthy elderly subjects. Decreased intrinsic activities in brain regions closely related to episodic memory were found in aMCI and AD patients. Increased TPJ and IPL activity may indicate compensatory mechanisms for loss of memory function in aMCI patients. These findings suggest that the fMRI based on ALFF analysis may provide a useful tool in the study of aMCI patients. ",
pmid_23075420,Behavioral and neural reactions to emotions of others in the distribution of resources.,,"This study investigated the neural mechanisms involved in the interpersonal effects of emotions--i.e., how people are influenced by other people's emotions. Participants were allocators in a version of the dictator game and made a choice between two offers after receiving written emotional expressions of the recipients. The results showed that participants more often made a self-serving offer when dealing with an angry recipient than when dealing with a happy or disappointed recipient. Compared to disappointment, expressions of anger increased activation in regions associated with self-referential thinking (anterior medial prefrontal cortex, aMPFC) and (emotional) conflict (anterior cingulate cortex). We found increased activation in temporoparietal junction for receiving happy reactions in comparison with receiving angry or disappointed reactions. This study thus emphasizes that distinct emotions have distinct effects on people in terms of behavior and underlying neurological mechanisms. ",
pmid_22398976,Neural bases of gaze and emotion processing in children with autism spectrum disorders.,,"Abnormal eye contact is a core symptom of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), though little is understood of the neural bases of gaze processing in ASD. Competing hypotheses suggest that individuals with ASD avoid eye contact due to the anxiety-provoking nature of direct eye gaze or that eye-gaze cues hold less interest or significance to children with ASD. The current study examined the effects of gaze direction on neural processing of emotional faces in typically developing (TD) children and those with ASD. While undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 16 high-functioning children and adolescents with ASD and 16 TD controls viewed a series of faces depicting emotional expressions with either direct or averted gaze. Children in both groups showed significant activity in visual-processing regions for both direct and averted gaze trials. However, there was a significant group by gaze interaction such that only TD children showed reliably greater activity in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex for direct versus averted gaze. The ASD group showed no difference between direct and averted gaze in response to faces conveying negative emotions. These results highlight the key role of eye gaze in signaling communicative intent and suggest altered processing of the emotional significance of direct gaze in children with ASD. ",

The subjects were studied by functional MRI (fMRI) during performance of a simple paced overlearned motor sequence task, with and without an additional attentional task. For the attentional task, subjects were instructed to attend either to their actions or to a visual distractor task. Statistical parametric mapping was used to implement a random effects analysis of the regional task-related activations in patient and control populations. Structural equation modelling of fMRI time series was used to measure effective connectivity among prefrontal and premotor areas. In both groups, the motor task was associated with activation of a distributed network including the premotor, motor and parietal cortex, striatum and cerebellum. In control subjects, but not patients, attention to action (relative to execution of an overlearned sequence) was associated with further activation of prefrontal, parietal and paracingulate cortex, and the supplementary motor area (SMA). Patients with Parkinson's disease showed greater than normal activation of the SMA during execution of the simple overlearned motor sequence, but less augmentation when attending to their actions. In control subjects, attention to action, but not attention to the visual distractor task, increased the effective connectivity between prefrontal cortex and both the lateral premotor cortex and the SMA. This represents a specific increase in effective connectivity. Attentional modulation of effective connectivity between the prefrontal, premotor cortex and SMA was not observed in patients. This deficit indicates a context-specific functional disconnection between the prefrontal cortex and the supplementary and premotor cortex in Parkinson's disease. ",
pmid_23909003,Tentative evidence for striatal hyperactivity in adolescent cannabis-using boys: a cross-sectional multicenter fMRI study.,,"Adolescents' risk-taking behavior has been linked to a maturational imbalance between reward (""go"") and inhibitory-control (""stop"")-related brain circuitry. This may drive adolescent drug-taking, such as cannabis use. In this study, we assessed the non-acute effects of adolescent cannabis use on reward-related brain function. We performed a two-site (United States and Netherlands; pooled data) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study with a cross-sectional design. Twenty-one abstinent but frequent cannabis-using boys were compared with 24 non-using peers on reward-related brain function, using a monetary incentive delay task with fMRI. Focus was on anticipatory and response stages of reward and brain areas critically involved in reward processing like the striatum. Performance in users was normal. Region-of-interest analysis indicated striatal hyperactivity during anticipatory stages of reward in users. Intriguingly, this effect was most pronounced during non-rewarding events. Striatal hyperactivity in adolescent cannabis users may signify an overly sensitive motivational brain circuitry. Frequent cannabis use during adolescence may induce diminished ability to disengage the motivational circuit when no reward can be obtained. This could strengthen the search for reinforcements like drugs of abuse, even when facing the negative (non-rewarding) consequences. ",
pmid_28964930,Grasping with a new hand: Improved performance and normalized grasp-selective brain responses despite persistent functional changes in primary motor cortex and low-level sensory and motor impairments.,,"Hand loss can now be reversed through surgical transplantation years or decades after amputation. Remarkably, these patients come to use their new hand to skilfully grasp and manipulate objects. The brain mechanisms that make this possible are unknown. Here we test the hypothesis that the anterior intraparietal cortex (aIPC) - a multimodal region implicated in hand preshaping and error correction during grasping - plays a key role in this compensatory grasp control. Motion capture and fMRI are used to characterize hand kinematics and brain responses during visually guided grasping with a transplanted hand at 26 and 41 months post-transplant in patient DR, a former hand amputee of 13 years. Compared with matched controls, DR shows increasingly normal grasp kinematics paralleled by increasingly robust grasp-selective fMRI responses within the very same brain areas that show grasp-selectivity in controls, including the aIPC, premotor and cerebellar cortices. Paradoxically, over this same time DR exhibits significant limitations in basic sensory and motor functions, and persistent amputation-related functional reorganization of primary motor cortex. Movements of the non-transplanted hand positively activate the ipsilateral primary motor hand area - a functional marker of persistent interhemispheric amputation-related reorganization. Our data demonstrate for the first time that even after more than a decade of living as an amputee the normative functional brain organization governing the control of grasping can be restored. We propose that the aIPC and interconnected premotor and cerebellar cortices enable grasp normalization by compensating for the functional impact of reorganizational changes in primary sensorimotor cortex and targeting errors in regenerating peripheral nerves.

primary insomnia","Primary insomnia (PI) is defined as a sleep disorder with no definite cause or inducement. Electroacupuncture, a treatment of inserting needles into specific points on the body surface and applying electrical stimulation, has been proved effective in treating PI with minimal adverse effects. However, the influence of gender difference on the clinical treatment efficacy of electroacupuncture for PI patients remains unclear. Therefore, we designed a clinical trial to compare the clinical treatment efficacy of electroacupuncture for PI patients with different genders. The research on the mechanism of electroacupuncture suggested it could modulate the sleep and wakefulness by activating or deactivating brain regions via a needling/tactile somatosensory specific stimulus. Therefore, we also designed a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) study to detect the spontaneous brain activity of PI patients before and after the electroacupuncture treatment. Thirty PI patients were recruited to accept 5-week electroacupuncture treatment on HT-7. Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) questionnaires were used to evaluate the clinical treatment efficacy. Rs-fMRI was employed to observe the spontaneous brain activity in the resting state at the baseline and after 5 weeks of electroacupuncture treatment, which was measured by the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF). The AIS and PSQI scores were significantly decreased both in the female PI group and the male PI group after treatment. The decreased PSQI of female patients was significantly more than that of male patients (p < .05). The gender-related difference in the cerebral response to electroacupuncture was mainly in posterior cingulate and supramarginal gyrus. There is a gender-related difference in the clinical treatment efficacy of electroacupuncture for PI patients, and female patients may benefit more from electroacupuncture. Gender-related differences in the cerebral response to electroacupuncture may be one of the factors affecting clinical treatment efficacy. ",
pmid_20947065,Altered function and connectivity of the medial frontal cortex in pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder.,,"Exaggerated concern for correct performance has been linked to hyperactivity of the medial frontal cortex (MFC) in adult obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but the role of the MFC during the early course of illness remains poorly understood. We tested whether hyperactive MFC-based performance monitoring function relates to altered MFC connectivity within task control and default mode networks in pediatric patients. Eighteen pairs of OCD and matched healthy youth underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during performance monitoring and at rest. Task-related hyperactivations in the posterior and ventral MFC were used as seeds for connectivity analyses during task and resting state. In posterior MFC, patients showed greater activation of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) than control subjects, with greater activation predicting worse performance. In ventral MFC, control subjects exhibited deactivation, whereas patients activated this region. Compared with control subjects, patients showed increased dACC-ventral MFC connectivity during task and decreased dACC-right anterior operculum and ventral MFC-posterior cingulate connectivity during rest. Excessive activation and increased interactions of posterior and ventral MFC during performance monitoring may combine with reduced resting state connectivity of these regions within networks for task control and default mode to reflect early markers of OCD. Alteration of reciprocal interactions between these networks could potentiate the intrusion of ventral MFC-based affectively laden, self-referential thoughts, while disrupting posterior MFC-based performance-monitoring function in young patients.

pmid_19969089,Volition diminishes genetically mediated amygdala hyperreactivity.,,"Individuals carrying the short allele of a common polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) exhibit heightened amygdala responses to passive stimulation with aversive emotional material. In turn, the level of amygdala activation in response to emotion can be decreased by will, for example by using cognitive emotion regulation strategies. In the present study, 37 female subjects (s-carriers: n=21; l/l-homozygotes: n=16) performed an emotion regulation task during functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine whether cognitive emotion regulation can modulate the genetically determined amygdala hyperreactivity in 5-HTTLPR short allele carriers. Our results demonstrate that cognitive emotion regulation diminishes the difference in amygdala reactivity to threat-related stimuli between 5-HTTLPR genotype groups. Furthermore, we also provide evidence that the effect of cognitive regulation is mediated through altered coupling between the amygdala and prefrontal regulatory regions. Our findings demonstrate that while the presence of the 5-HTTLPR short allele leads to heightened responses in the amygdala, cognitive regulation can modify genetically mediated effects upon brain function by volitionally altering prefrontal-amygdala connectivity.

We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine potential amygdala-PFC functional connectivity abnormalities in treatment-naive subjects with MDD. Resting-state fMRI data were acquired from 28 individuals with MDD and 30 healthy control (HC) subjects. Amygdala-PFC functional connectivity was compared between the MDD and HC groups. Decreased functional connectivity to the left ventral PFC (VPFC) from the left and right amygdala was observed in the MDD group, compared with the HC group (p < 0.05, corrected). The treatment-naive subjects with MDD showed decreased functional connectivity from the amygdala to the VPFC, especially to the left VPFC. This suggests that these connections may play an important role in the neuropathophysiology of MDD at its onset. ",
pmid_20479758,Investigating neural primacy in Major Depressive Disorder: multivariate Granger causality analysis of resting-state fMRI time-series data.,,"Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) has been conceptualized as a neural network-level disease. Few studies of the neural bases of depression, however, have used analytical techniques that are capable of testing network-level hypotheses of neural dysfunction in this disorder. Moreover, of those that have, fewer still have attempted to determine the directionality of influence within functionally abnormal networks of structures. We used multivariate GC analysis, a technique that estimates the extent to which preceding neural activity in one or more seed regions predicts subsequent activity in target brain regions, to analyze blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) data collected during eyes-closed rest from depressed and never-depressed persons. We found that activation in the hippocampus predicted subsequent increases in ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) activity in depression, and that activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and vACC were mutually reinforcing in MDD. Hippocampal and vACC activation in depressed participants predicted subsequent decreases in dorsal cortical activity. This study shows that, on a moment-by-moment basis, there is increased excitatory activity among limbic and paralimbic structures, as well as increased inhibition in the activity of dorsal cortical structures, by limbic structures in depression; these aberrant patterns of effective connectivity implicate disturbances in the mesostriatal dopamine system in depression. These findings advance the neural theory of depression by detailing specific patterns of limbic excitation in MDD, by making explicit the primary role of limbic inhibition of dorsal cortex in the cortico-limbic relation posited to underlie depression, and by presenting an integrated neurofunctional account of altered dopamine function in this disorder.

pmid_30655506,Investigating the predictive value of different resting-state functional MRI parameters in obsessive-compulsive disorder.,,"Previous resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) studies of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have facilitated our understanding of OCD pathophysiology based on its intrinsic activity. However, whether the group difference derived from univariate analysis could be useful for informing the diagnosis of individual OCD patients remains unclear. We aimed to apply multivariate pattern analysis of different rs-fMRI parameters to distinguish drug-naive patients with OCD from healthy control subjects (HCS). Fifty-four drug-naive OCD patients and 54 well-matched HCS were recruited. Four different rs-fMRI parameter maps, including the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity strength (FCS), were calculated. Training of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier using rs-fMRI maps produced voxelwise discrimination maps. Overall, the classification accuracies were acceptable for the four rs-fMRI parameters. Excellent performance was achieved when ALFF maps were employed (accuracy, 95.37%, p < 0.01), good performance was achieved by using ReHo maps, weaker performance was achieved by using fALFF maps, and fair performance was achieved by using FCS maps. The brain regions showing the greatest discriminative power included the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, precentral gyrus, and occipital lobes. The application of SVM to rs-fMRI features may provide potential power for OCD classification. ",

Understanding how and why probability is distorted is a key issue in understanding the peculiar character of experience-based decision. We consider how probability information is used not just in decision-making but also in a wide variety of cognitive, perceptual, and motor tasks. Very similar patterns of distortion of probability/frequency information have been found in visual frequency estimation, frequency estimation based on memory, signal detection theory, and in the use of probability information in decision-making under risk and uncertainty. We show that distortion of probability in all cases is well captured as linear transformations of the log odds of frequency and/or probability, a model with a slope parameter, and an intercept parameter. We then consider how task and experience influence these two parameters and the resulting distortion of probability. We review how the probability distortions change in systematic ways with task and report three experiments on frequency distortion where the distortions change systematically in the same task. We found that the slope of frequency distortions decreases with the sample size, which is echoed by findings in decision from experience. We review previous models of the representation of uncertainty and find that none can account for the empirical findings. ",
pmid_24086365,Emotional processing of personally familiar faces in the vegetative state.,,"The Vegetative State (VS) is a severe disorder of consciousness in which patients are awake but display no signs of awareness. Yet, recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have demonstrated evidence for covert awareness in VS patients by recording specific brain activations during a cognitive task. However, the possible existence of incommunicable subjective emotional experiences in VS patients remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to probe the question of whether VS patients retain a brain ability to selectively process external stimuli according to their emotional value and look for evidence of covert emotional awareness in patients. In order to explore these questions we employed the emotive impact of observing personally familiar faces, known to provoke specific perceptual as well as emotional brain activations. Four VS patients and thirteen healthy controls first underwent an fMRI scan while viewing pictures of non-familiar faces, personally familiar faces and pictures of themselves. In a subsequent imagery task participants were asked to actively imagine one of their parent's faces. Analyses focused on face and familiarity selective regional brain activations and inter-regional functional connectivity. Similar to controls, all patients displayed face selective brain responses with further limbic and cortical activations elicited by familiar faces. In patients as well as controls, Connectivity was observed between emotional, visual and face specific areas, suggesting aware emotional perception. This connectivity was strongest in the two patients who later recovered. Notably, these two patients also displayed selective amygdala activation during familiar face imagery, with one further exhibiting face selective activations, indistinguishable from healthy controls. Taken together, these results show that selective emotional processing can be elicited in VS patients both by external emotionally salient stimuli and by internal cognitive processes, suggesting the ability for covert emotional awareness of self and the environment in VS patients.

Most studies clarifying the neuronal pathway produced by acupuncture were still applied to healthy subjects with limited single acupuncture point stimulation, which was inconsistency with clinical practice. Thus, in our present study, we investigate the differences between brain activity changes in AD and MCI patients caused by multi-acupuncture point Siguan (four gates), in order to provide visualized evidence for neuronal specificity of clinical acupuncture. Forty-nine subjects were recruited, including 21 AD patients, 14 MCI patients, and 14 healthy controls (HC). AD and MCI patients were randomly divided into two groups, respectively: real acupuncture point group (14 AD and 8 MCI) and sham acupuncture point group (7 AD and 6 MCI). We adopted a 16-minute, single-block, experimental design for acquiring functional MRI images. We found, in AD and MCI patients, Siguan (four gates) elicited extensive activations and deactivations in cognitive-related areas, visual-related areas, the sensorimotor-related area, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Compared with HC, AD and MCI patients showed similar activations in cognitive-related brain areas (inferior frontal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and rolandic operculum) as well as deactivations in cognitive-related areas, visual-related areas, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, which were not found in HC. Compared with sham acupuncture points, real acupuncture points produced more specific brain changes with both activated and deactivated brain activities in AD and MCI. The preliminary results in our study verified the objective evidence for neuronal specificity of acupuncture in AD and MCI patients. ",

fMRI","Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may be adopted as a complementary tool for bedside observation in the disorders of consciousness (DOC). However, the diagnostic value of this technique is still debated because of the lack of accuracy in determining levels of consciousness within a single patient. Recently, Giacino and colleagues (2014) hypothesized that a longitudinal fMRI evaluation may provide a more informative assessment in the detection of residual awareness. The aim of this study was to measure the correspondence between clinically defined level of awareness and neural responses within a single DOC patient. We used a follow-up fMRI design in combination with a passive speech-processing task. Patient's consciousness was measured through time by using the Coma Recovery Scale. The patient progressed from a vegetative state (VS) to a minimally conscious state (MCS). Patient's task-related neural responses mirrored the clinical change from a VS to an MCS. Specifically, while in an MCS, but not a VS, the patient showed a selective recruitment of the left angular gyrus when he listened to a native speech narrative, as compared to the reverse presentation of the same stimulus. Furthermore, the patient showed an increased response in the language-related brain network and a greater deactivation in the default mode network following his progression to an MCS. Our findings indicate that longitudinal assessment of brain responses to passive stimuli can contribute to the definition of the clinical status in individual patients with DOC and represents an adequate counterpart of the bedside assessment during the diagnostic decision-making process.

fMRI","Tinnitus, a phantom ringing, buzzing, or hissing sensation with potentially debilitating consequences, is thought to arise from aberrant spontaneous neural activity at one or more sites within the central nervous system; however, the location and specific features of these oscillations are poorly understood with respect to specific tinnitus features. Recent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies suggest that aberrant fluctuations in spontaneous low-frequency oscillations (LFO) of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal may be an important factor in chronic tinnitus; however, the role that frequency-specific components of LFO play in subjective tinnitus remains unclear. A total of 39 chronic tinnitus patients and 41 well-matched healthy controls participated in the resting-state fMRI scans. The LFO amplitudes were investigated using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF) in two different frequency bands (slow-4: 0.027-0.073 Hz and slow-5: 0.01-0.027 Hz). We observed significant differences between tinnitus patients and normal controls in ALFF/fALFF in the two bands (slow-4 and slow-5) in several brain regions including the superior frontal gyrus (SFG), inferior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, angular gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and middle occipital gyrus. Across the entire subject pool, significant differences in ALFF/fALFF between the two bands were found in the midbrain, basal ganglia, hippocampus and cerebellum (Slow 4 > Slow 5), and in the middle frontal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus (Slow 5 > Slow 4). We also observed significant interaction between frequency bands and patient groups in the orbitofrontal gyrus. Furthermore, tinnitus distress was positively correlated with the magnitude of ALFF in right SFG and the magnitude of fALFF slow-4 band in left SFG, whereas tinnitus duration was positively correlated with the magnitude of ALFF in right SFG and the magnitude of fALFF slow-5 band in left SFG. Resting-state fMRI provides an unbiased method for identifying aberrant spontaneous LFO occurring throughout the central nervous system. Chronic tinnitus patients have widespread abnormalities in ALFF and fALFF slow-4 and slow-5 band which are correlated with tinnitus distress and duration. These results provide new insights on the neuropathophysiology of chronic tinnitus; therapies capable of reversing these aberrant patterns may reduce tinnitus distress. ",
pmid_26439278,Aberrant intra- and inter-network connectivity architectures in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.,,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and those with high-risk mild cognitive impairment are increasingly considered to have dysfunction syndromes. Large-scale network studies based on neuroimaging techniques may provide additional insight into AD pathophysiology. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the impaired network functional connectivity with the disease progression. For this purpose, we explored altered functional connectivities based on previously well-defined brain areas that comprise the five key functional systems [the default mode network (DMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), control network (CON), salience network (SAL), sensorimotor network (SMN)] in 35 with AD and 27 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, compared with 27 normal cognitive subjects. Based on three levels of analysis, we found that intra- and inter-network connectivity were impaired in AD. Importantly, the interaction between the sensorimotor and attention functions was first attacked at the MCI stage and then extended to the key functional systems in the AD individuals. Lower cognitive ability (lower MMSE scores) was significantly associated with greater reductions in intra- and inter-network connectivity across all patient groups. These profiles indicate that aberrant intra- and inter-network dysfunctions might be potential biomarkers or predictors of AD progression and provide new insight into AD pathophysiology. ",

This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study explored the neural correlates of visually induced food reward and loathing. Sixty-seven female participants assigned to one of four groups (overweight BED patients, overweight healthy control subjects, normal-weight healthy control subjects, and normal-weight patients with bulimia nervosa) participated in the experiment. After an overnight fast, the participants' brain activation was recorded during each of the following three conditions: visual exposure to high-caloric food, to disgust-inducing pictures, and to affectively neutral pictures. After the fMRI experiment, the participants rated the affective value of the pictures. Each of the groups experienced the food pictures as very pleasant. Relative to the neutral pictures, the visual food stimuli provoked increased activation in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and insula across all participants. The BED patients reported enhanced reward sensitivity and showed stronger medial OFC responses while viewing food pictures than all other groups. The bulimic patients displayed greater arousal, ACC activation, and insula activation than the other groups. Neural responses to the disgust-inducing pictures as well as trait disgust did not differ between the groups. This study provides first evidence of differential brain activation to visual food stimuli in patients suffering from BED and bulimia nervosa. ",

neuroimaging","It is unclear whether reflective awareness of emotions is related to extent and intensity of implicit affective reactions. This study is the first to investigate automatic brain reactivity to emotional stimuli as a function of trait emotional awareness. To assess emotional awareness the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale (LEAS) was administered. During scanning, masked happy, angry, fearful and neutral facial expressions were presented to 46 healthy subjects, who had to rate the fit between artificial and emotional words. The rating procedure allowed assessment of shifts in implicit affectivity due to emotion faces. Trait emotional awareness was associated with increased activation in the primary somatosensory cortex, inferior parietal lobule, anterior cingulate gyrus, middle frontal and cerebellar areas, thalamus, putamen and amygdala in response to masked happy faces. LEAS correlated positively with shifts in implicit affect caused by masked happy faces. According to our findings, people with high emotional awareness show stronger affective reactivity and more activation in brain areas involved in emotion processing and simulation during the perception of masked happy facial expression than people with low emotional awareness. High emotional awareness appears to be characterized by an enhanced positive affective resonance to others at an automatic processing level. ",
pmid_18240326,Partially segregated neural networks for spatial and contextual memory in virtual navigation.,,"Finding our way in a previously learned, ecologically valid environment concurrently involves spatial and contextual cognitive operations. The former process accesses a cognitive map representing the spatial interactions between all paths in the environment. The latter accesses stored associations between landmark objects and their milieu. Here, we aimed at dissociating their neural basis in the context of memory-based virtual navigation. To do so, subjects freely explored a virtual town for 1 h, then were scanned using fMRI while retrieving their way between two locations, under four navigation conditions designed to probe separately or jointly the spatial and contextual memory components. Besides prominent commonalities found in a large hippocampo-neocortical network classically involved in topographical navigation, results yield evidence for a partial dissociation between the brain areas supporting spatial and contextual components of memory-based navigation. Performance-related analyses indicate that hippocampal activity mostly supports the spatial component, whereas parahippocampal activity primarily supports the contextual component. Additionally, the recruitment of contextual memory during navigation was associated with higher frontal, posterior parietal and lateral temporal activity. These results provide evidence for a partial segregation of the neural substrates of two crucial memory components in human navigation, whose combined involvement eventually leads to efficient navigation behavior within a learned environment.

pmid_22698763,The effect of family therapy on the changes in the severity of on-line game play and brain activity in adolescents with on-line game addiction.,,"We evaluated whether a brief 3-week family therapy intervention would change patterns of brain activation in response to affection and gaming cues in adolescents from dysfunctional families who met criteria for on-line game addiction. Fifteen adolescents with on-line game addiction and fifteen adolescents without problematic on-line game play and an intact family structure were recruited. Over 3 weeks, families were asked to carry out homework assignments focused on increasing family cohesion for more than 1 hour/day and 4 days/week. Before therapy, adolescents with on-line game addiction demonstrated decreased activity as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) within the caudate, middle temporal gyrus, and occipital lobe in response to images depicting parental affection and increased activity of the middle frontal and inferior parietal in response scenes from on-line games, relative to healthy comparison subjects. Improvement in perceived family cohesion following 3 weeks of treatment was associated with an increase in the activity of the caudate nucleus in response to affection stimuli and was inversely correlated with changes in on-line game playing time. With evidence of brain activation changes in response to on-line game playing cues and images depicting parental love, the present findings suggest that family cohesion may be an important factor in the treatment of problematic on-line game playing.

We aimed to identify patterns of neuroanatomical substrate alterations associated with migraine and insomnia comorbidity. High-resolution T1-weighted images were acquired from subjects with insomnia, migraine, and comorbid migraine and insomnia, respectively, and healthy controls (HC). Direct group comparisons with HC followed by conjunction analyses identified shared regional gray matter volume (GMV) alterations between the disorders. To further examine large-scale anatomical network changes, a seed-based structural covariance network (SCN) analysis was applied. Conjunction analyses also identified common SCN alterations in two disease groups, and we further evaluated these shared regional and global neuroanatomical signatures in the comorbid group. Compared with controls, patients with migraine and insomnia showed GMV changes in the cerebellum and the lingual, precentral, and postcentral gyri (PCG). The bilateral PCG were common GMV alteration sites in both groups, with decreased structural covariance integrity observed in the cerebellum. In patients with comorbid migraine and insomnia, shared regional GMV and global SCN changes were consistently observed. The GMV of the right PCG also correlated with sleep quality in these patients. These findings highlight the specific role of the PCG in the shared pathophysiology of insomnia and migraine from a regional and global brain network perspective. These multilevel neuroanatomical changes could be used as potential image markers to decipher the comorbidity of the two disorders. ",
pmid_20932912,Working memory maintenance of grasp-target information in the human posterior parietal cortex.,,"Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was applied to identify cortical areas involved in maintaining target information in working memory used for an upcoming grasping action. Participants had to grasp with their thumb and index finger of the dominant right hand three-dimensional objects of different size and orientation. Reaching-to-grasp movements were performed without visual feedback either immediately after object presentation or after a variable delay of 2-12 s. The right inferior parietal cortex demonstrated sustained neural activity throughout the delay, which overlapped with activity observed during encoding of the grasp target. Immediate and delayed grasping activated similar motor-related brain areas and showed no differential activity. The results suggest that the right inferior parietal cortex plays an important functional role in working memory maintenance of grasp-related information. Moreover, our findings confirm the assumption that brain areas engaged in maintaining information are also involved in encoding the same information, and thus extend previous findings on working memory function of the posterior parietal cortex in saccadic behavior to reach-to-grasp movements.

pmid_31051296,Neural similarity at temporal lobe and cerebellum predicts out-of-sample preference and recall for video stimuli.,,"The extent to which brains respond similarly to a specific stimulus, across a small group of individuals, has been previously found to predict out-of-sample aggregate preference for that stimulus. However, the location in the brain where neural similarity predicts out-of-sample preference remains unclear. In this article, we attempt to identify the neural substrates in three functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. Two fMRI studies (N = 40 and 20), using previously broadcasted TV commercials, show that spatiotemporal neural similarity at temporal lobe and cerebellum predict out-of-sample preference and recall. A follow-up fMRI study (N = 28) with previously unseen movie-trailers replicated the predictive effect of neural similarity. Moreover, neural similarity provided unique information on out-of-sample preference above and beyond in-sample preference. Overall, the findings suggest that neural similarity at temporal lobe and cerebellum - traditionally associated with sensory integration and emotional processing - may reflect the level of engagement with video stimuli.

pmid_16798015,fMRI investigation of cortical and subcortical networks in the learning of abstract and effector-specific representations of motor sequences.,,"A visuo-motor sequence can be learned as a series of visuo-spatial cues or as a sequence of effector movements. Earlier imaging studies have revealed that a network of brain areas is activated in the course of motor sequence learning. However, these studies do not address the question of the type of representation being established at various stages of visuo-motor sequence learning. In an earlier behavioral study, we demonstrated that acquisition of visuo-spatial sequence representation enables rapid learning in the early stage and progressive establishment of somato-motor representation helps speedier execution by the late stage. We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments wherein subjects learned and practiced the same sequence alternately in normal and rotated settings. In one rotated setting (visual), subjects learned a new motor sequence in response to an identical sequence of visual cues as in normal. In another rotated setting (motor), the display sequence was altered as compared to normal, but the same sequence of effector movements was used to perform the sequence. Comparison of different rotated settings revealed analogous transitions both in the cortical and subcortical sites during visuo-motor sequence learning-a transition of activity from parietal to parietal-premotor and then to premotor cortex and a concomitant shift was observed from anterior putamen to a combined activity in both anterior and posterior putamen and finally to posterior putamen. These results suggest a putative role for engagement of different cortical and subcortical networks at various stages of learning in supporting distinct sequence representations. ",

reappraisal","Reappraisal, the cognitive reevaluation of a potentially emotionally arousing event, has been proposed to be based upon top-down appraisal systems within the prefrontal cortex (PFC). It still remains unclear, however, how different prefrontal regions interact to control and regulate emotional responses. We used fMRI and dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to characterize the functional interrelationships among dorsal and ventral PFC regions involved in reappraisal. Specifically, we examined the effective connectivity between the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), and other reappraisal-related regions (supplementary motor area, supramarginal gyrus) during the up- and downregulation of emotions in response to highly arousing extreme sports film clips. We found DLPFC to be the central node of the prefrontal emotion regulation network, strongly interconnected with the IFG. The DCM analysis further revealed excitatory changes of connection strength from the DLPFC to the IFG and strong inhibitory changes of connection strength between the IFG and DLPFC during reappraisal. These bidirectional changes in connectivity strength indicate a feedback mechanism by which the IFG may select one out of several possible goal-appropriate reappraisals held active in working memory (represented in the DLPFC) and inhibits the DLPFC once the selection process is completed.

We have previously reported results of a case series investigating in-vivo food exposure in AN, demonstrating the feasibility and acceptability of this treatment together with evidence of significant clinical change (Cardi, Leppanen, Mataix-Cols, Campbell, & Treasure, 2019). The current study examined the neural circuitry of food-related anxiety. We examined neural reactivity (fMRI) to food images pre- and post-food exposure therapy (n=16), and compared it to a group of healthy control participants (HC n=21) who were scanned on two occasions. Prior to treatment, the AN group (compared to HC) showed less reactivity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Following exposure treatment, patients (compared to HC), show increased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, decreased activity in the superior parietal lobe and no differences in the ACC. The level of activation of the insula (pre-treatment) predicted the degree of post-treatment reduction in self-reported food anxiety in AN. Changes in food-related anxiety were also associated with changes in neural activation in a cluster located in the middle temporal gyrus/lateral parietal cortex. The primary limitations of this work are the small sample size and lack of patient comparison group. Exposure to food in AN may be associated with changes in neural circuitries implicated in emotion regulation and attentional processes. However, these findings need replication in larger and controlled studies. ",
pmid_22608240,Divergent brain network connectivity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,,"Using resting state (RS) functional magnetic resonance imaging and independent component analysis, the integrity of brain networks related to cognition and behavior was investigated in 20 nondemented patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The association between RS functional connectivity and executive functions was assessed in 16 patients with neuropsychological assessment. ALS patients compared with control subjects showed a decreased connectivity of the right orbitofrontal cortex, and an enhanced connectivity of the left precuneus in the default mode network; a decreased connectivity of the left inferior frontal cortex, and an increased connectivity of the right angular gyrus in the right frontoparietal network; and an increased connectivity of the parietal cortex in the left frontoparietal network. The enhanced parietal connectivity was associated with the clinical and cognitive deficits of the patients. In ALS, an alteration of large-scale functional brain networks associated with cognition does occur, even in the absence of overt dementia. The increased parietal connectivity may have a role in an attempt to maintain cognitive efficiency in the presence of structural frontotemporal injury. ",
pmid_19632248,Reduced sensitivity to minimum-jerk biological motion in autism spectrum conditions.,,"We compared psychophysical thresholds for biological and non-biological motion detection in adults with autism spectrum conditions (ASCs) and controls. Participants watched animations of a biological stimulus (a moving hand) or a non-biological stimulus (a falling tennis ball). The velocity profile of the movement was varied between 100% natural motion (minimum-jerk (MJ) for the hand; gravitational (G) for the ball) and 100% constant velocity (CV). Participants were asked to judge which animation was 'less natural' in a two-interval forced-choice paradigm and thresholds were estimated adaptively. There was a significant interaction between group and condition. Thresholds in the MJ condition were lower than in the G condition for the NC group whereas there was no difference between the thresholds in the two conditions for the ASC group. Thus, unlike the controls, the ASC group did not show an increased sensitivity for perturbation to biological over non-biological velocity profiles. ",

Video games","Video gaming can be associated with inter-individual differences in brain morphology. Much of this literature has focused on non-professional/occasional gamers who barely play, on the one extreme; or Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) cases who typically play more than 5 h/day, on the other extreme. We sought to extend this literature and focus on extensive gamers, who play about 3 h/day, which is typically more than non-professional gamers, but less than IGD cases. Findings regarding this sector of gamers can inform research on risk factors or markers for IGD development, even before addiction symptoms emerge. We predicted that extensive gamers have smaller prefrontal regions that presumably reflect weaker inhibition abilities, and larger visuomotor regions that presumably reflect stronger motor skills in response to visual stimuli. We tested these assertions with a between-subject brain morphology comparison of 26 extensive League of Legends (LOL) and matched 26 non-gamers, using voxel based morphometry, deformation based morphometry, and cortical thickness and sulcus depth analyses. Findings largely supported our predictions by pointing to morphological alterations in extensive gamers in the bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as well is in the left superior parietal lobule. These findings suggest that extensive gamers, at least of Massive-Multiplayer battle arena games, present brain alterations that are consistent with presumed loss of control (as mediated by the prefrontal cortex), but also improved attention and visoumotor skills (as mediated by superior parietal lobule). Implications for research and practice are discussed. ",
pmid_19666038,No evidence for impaired perception of biological motion in adults with autistic spectrum disorders.,,"A central feature of autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs) is a difficulty in identifying and reading human expressions, including those present in the moving human form. One previous study, by Blake et al. (2003), reports decreased sensitivity for perceiving biological motion in children with autism, suggesting that perceptual anomalies underlie problems in social cognition. We revisited this issue using a novel psychophysical task. 16 adults with ASDs and 16 controls were asked to detect the direction of movement of human point-light walkers which were presented in both normal and spatially scrambled forms in a background of noise. Unlike convention direction discrimination tasks, in which walkers walk 'on the spot' while facing left or right, we added translatory motion to the stimulus so that the walkers physically moved across the screen. Therefore, while a cue of coherent, translatory motion was available in both the normal and scrambled walker forms, the normal walker alone contained information about the configuration and kinematics of the human body. There was a significant effect of walker type, with reduced response times and error when the normal walker was present. Most importantly, these improvements were the same for both participant groups, suggesting that people with ASDs do not have difficulty integrating local visual information into a global percept of the moving human form. The discrepancy between these and previous findings of impaired biological motion perception in ASDs are discussed with reference to differences in the age and diagnosis of the participants, and the nature of the task.

pmid_17346989,Mental rotation and object categorization share a common network of prefrontal and dorsal and ventral regions of posterior cortex.,,"The multiple-views-plus-transformation variant of object model verification theories predicts that parietal regions that are critical for mental rotation contribute to visual object cognition. Some neuroimaging studies have shown that the intraparietal sulcus region is critically involved in mental rotation. Other studies indicate that both ventral and dorsal posterior regions are object-sensitive and involved in object perception and categorization tasks. However, it is unknown whether dorsal object-sensitive areas overlap with regions recruited for object mental rotation. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to test this directly. Participants performed standard tasks of object categorization, mental rotation, and eye movements. Results provided clear support for the prediction, demonstrating overlap between dorsal object-sensitive regions in ventral-caudal intraparietal sulcus (vcIPS) and an adjacent dorsal occipital area and the regions that are activated during mental rotation but not during saccades. In addition, object mental rotation (but not saccades) activated object-sensitive areas in lateral dorsal occipitotemporal cortex (DOT), and both mental rotation and object categorization recruited ventrolateral prefrontal cortex areas implicated in attention, working memory, and cognitive control. These findings provide clear evidence that a prefrontal-posterior cortical system implicated in mental rotation, including the occipitoparietal regions critical for this spatial task, is recruited during visual object categorization. Altogether, the findings provide a key link in understanding the role of dorsal and ventral visual areas in spatial and object perception and cognition: Regions in occipitoparietal cortex, as well as DOT cortex, have a general role in visual object cognition, supporting not only mental rotation but also categorization.

willingness-to-pay","Considerable evidence points to a link between body mass index (BMI), eating behavior, and the brain's reward system. However, much of this research focuses on food cue reactivity without examining the subjective valuation process as a potential mechanism driving individual differences in BMI and eating behavior. The current pre-registered study (https://osf.io/n4c95/) examined the relationship between BMI, healthy eating, and subjective valuation of healthy and unhealthy foods in a community sample of individuals with higher BMI who intended to eat more healthily. Particularly, we examined: (1) alterations in neurocognitive measures of subjective valuation related to BMI and healthy eating; (2) differences in the neurocognitive valuation for healthy and unhealthy foods and their relation to BMI and healthy eating; (3) and whether we could conceptually replicate prior findings demonstrating differences in neural reactivity to palatable vs. plain foods. To this end, we scanned 105 participants with BMIs ranging from 23 to 42 using fMRI during a willingness-to-pay task that quantifies trial-by-trial valuation of 30 healthy and 30 unhealthy food items. We measured out of lab eating behavior via the Automated Self-Administered 24 H Dietary Assessment Tool, which allowed us to calculate a Healthy Eating Index (HEI). We found that our sample exhibited robust, positive linear relationships between self-reported value and neural responses in regions previously implicated in studies of subjective value, suggesting an intact valuation system. However, we found no relationship between valuation and BMI nor HEI, with Bayes Factor indicating moderate evidence for a null relationship. Separating the food types revealed that healthy eating, as measured by the HEI, was inversely related to subjective valuation of unhealthy foods. Imaging data further revealed a stronger linkage between valuation of healthy (compared to unhealthy) foods and corresponding response in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and that the interaction between healthy and unhealthy food valuation in this region is related to HEI. Finally, our results did not replicate reactivity differences demonstrated in prior work, likely due to differences in the mapping between food healthiness and palatability. Together, our findings point to disruptions in the valuation of unhealthy foods in the vmPFC as a potential mechanism influencing healthy eating. ",
pmid_23613739,Neural congruency effects in the multi-source interference task vanish in healthy youth after controlling for conditional differences in mean RT.,,"According to the conflict monitoring model of cognitive control, reaction time (RT) in distracter interference tasks (e.g., the Stroop task) is a more precise index of response conflict than stimulus congruency (incongruent vs. congruent). The model therefore predicts that RT should be a reliable predictor of activity in regions of the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) that are posited to detect response conflict. In particular, pMFC activity should be (a) greater in slow-RT than in fast-RT trials within a given task condition (e.g., congruent) and (b) equivalent in RT-matched trials from different conditions (i.e., congruent and incongruent trials). Both of these effects have been observed in functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of adults. However, neither effect was observed in a recent study of healthy youth, suggesting that (a) the model does not accurately describe the relationship between RT and pMFC activity in this population or (b) the recent study was characterized by high variability due to a relatively small sample size. To distinguish between these possibilities, we asked a relatively large group of healthy youth (n = 28) to perform a distracter interference task - the multi-source interference task (MSIT) - while we recorded their brain activity with functional MRI. In this relatively large sample, both of the model's predictions were confirmed. We conclude that the model accurately describes the relationship between pMFC activity and RT in healthy youth, but that additional research is needed to determine whether processes unrelated to response conflict contribute to this relationship.

pmid_20219991,The relationship of lyrics and tunes in the processing of unfamiliar songs: a functional magnetic resonance adaptation study.,,"The cognitive relationship between lyrics and tunes in song is currently under debate, with some researchers arguing that lyrics and tunes are represented as separate components, while others suggest that they are processed in integration. The present study addressed this issue by means of a functional magnetic resonance adaptation paradigm during passive listening to unfamiliar songs. The repetition and variation of lyrics and/or tunes in blocks of six songs was crossed in a 2 x 2 factorial design to induce selective adaptation for each component. Reductions of the hemodynamic response were observed along the superior temporal sulcus and gyrus (STS/STG) bilaterally. Within these regions, the left mid-STS showed an interaction of the adaptation effects for lyrics and tunes, suggesting an integrated processing of the two components at prelexical, phonemic processing levels. The degree of integration decayed toward more anterior regions of the left STS, where the lack of such an interaction and the stronger adaptation for lyrics than for tunes was suggestive of an independent processing of lyrics, perhaps resulting from the processing of meaning. Finally, evidence for an integrated representation of lyrics and tunes was found in the left dorsal precentral gyrus (PrCG), possibly relating to the build-up of a vocal code for singing in which musical and linguistic features of song are fused. Overall, these results demonstrate that lyrics and tunes are processed at varying degrees of integration (and separation) through the consecutive processing levels allocated along the posterior-anterior axis of the left STS and the left PrCG.

Visual cortex","The hypothalamus plays a central role in the pathophysiology of migraine and is considered to be the ""migraine generator."" It participates in initiating a migraine attack through its connectivity to regions of the brain involved in processing and modulating pain. However, the underlying mechanisms of hypothalamic effective functional connectivity that bring about migraines remain unclear. This study investigated the hypothalamus-based directional effective connectivity in migraine without aura patients and assessed associations among the clinical characteristics. Seven patients with migraine without aura during the attack (MWoA-DA) (four with photophobia (MWoA-DAWP) and three without photophobia (MWoA-DAWoP)), twenty-seven patients with migraine without aura during the interictal period (MWoA-DI), and twenty-nine healthy controls (HC) were included in this study. Granger causality analysis (GCA) was used to investigate the directional effective connectivity between the hypothalamus and other brain regions. MWoA-DA patients exhibited decreased outflow from the bilateral hypothalamus to the visual cortex compared with the MWoA-DI patients and HCs. The MWoA-DAWP group primarily contributed to this result. The MWoA-DA patients showed decreased outflow from the bilateral hypothalamus to the right inferior parietal gyrus compared with the HCs. The visual analogue scale (VAS) was negatively correlated with abnormal effective functional connectivity from the right hypothalamus to the right inferior parietal gyrus in the MWoA-DA group. These data provide evidence that the hypothalamus might serve as a central component of a multisystem network implicated in migraine and ictal photophobia, which includes hypothalamus and the visual and trigeminovascular systems.

Recent clinical trials have suggested that mindfulness is a promising intervention in adults with ADHD. We performed a randomised controlled clinical trial to investigate working memory (WM) with an n-back task in adults with ADHD during fMRI before and after an 8-week mindfulness intervention (MAP) compared with psychoeducation (PE). ADHD symptoms were assessed using the self- and observer-rated Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS). The complete pre-post data of 21 MAP and 19 PE participants were analysed. We found no group difference in ADHD symptoms or task performance at the pre-measurement, but there was a significant decrease in ADHD symptoms and significant improvement in task performance in both groups at the post-measurement. Furthermore, we found a significant increase in task-related activation in the right parietal lobe, with no difference between groups. Exploratory two-sample paired t-tests revealed significant increased brain activation after MAP in the bilateral inferior parietal lobule, right posterior insula and right precuneus. A decrease in self-rated 'Inattention/Memory Problems' after MAP compared to baseline was associated with stronger activation in parts of the left putamen, globus pallidus and thalamus. ",
pmid_19428413,A failure to grasp the affective meaning of actions in autism spectrum disorder subjects.,,"The ability to grasp emotional messages in everyday gestures and respond to them is at the core of successful social communication. The hypothesis that abnormalities in socio-emotional behavior in people with autism are linked to a failure to grasp emotional significance conveyed by gestures was explored. We measured brain activity using fMRI during perception of fearful or neutral actions and showed that whereas similar activation of brain regions known to play a role in action perception was revealed in both autistics and controls, autistics failed to activate amygdala, inferior frontal gyrus and premotor cortex when viewing gestures expressing fear. Our results support the notion that dysfunctions in this network may contribute significantly to the characteristic communicative impairments documented in autism. ",
pmid_22794262,Linking brain structure and activation in temporoparietal junction to explain the neurobiology of human altruism.,,"Human altruism shaped our evolutionary history and pervades social and political life. There are, however, enormous individual differences in altruism. Some people are almost completely selfish, while others display strong altruism, and the factors behind this heterogeneity are only poorly understood. We examine the neuroanatomical basis of these differences with voxel-based morphometry and show that gray matter (GM) volume in the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is strongly associated with both individuals' altruism and the individual-specific conditions under which this brain region is recruited during altruistic decision making. Thus, individual differences in GM volume in TPJ not only translate into individual differences in the general propensity to behave altruistically, but they also create a link between brain structure and brain function by indicating the conditions under which individuals are likely to recruit this region when they face a conflict between altruistic and selfish acts.

Relapse risk","Alcohol relapse is often occurring to regulate negative affect during withdrawal. On the neurobiological level, alcoholism is associated with gray matter (GM) abnormalities in regions that regulate emotional experience such as the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). However, no study to our knowledge has investigated the neurobiological unpinning of affect in alcoholism at early withdrawal and the associations of OFC volume with long-term relapse risk. One hundred and eighty-two participants were included, 95 recently detoxified alcohol dependent patients (ADP) and 87 healthy controls (HC). We measured affective states using the positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS). We collected T1-weighted brain structural images and performed Voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Findings revealed GM volume decrease in alcoholics in the prefrontal cortex (including medial OFC), anterior cingulate gyrus, and insula. GM volume in the medial OFC was positively associated with NA in the ADP group. Cox regression analysis predicted that risk to heavy relapse at 6 months increases with decreased GM volume in the medial OFC. Negative affect during alcohol withdrawal was positively associated with OFC volume. What is more, increased GM volume in the OFC also moderated risk to heavy relapse at 6 months. Reduced GM in the OFC poses as risk to recovery from alcohol dependence and provides valuable insights into transient negative affect states during withdrawal that can trigger relapse. Implications exist for therapeutic interventions signifying the OFC as a neurobiological marker to relapse and could explain the inability of ADP to regulate internal negative affective states. ",

Six children with SLI and seven control children participated in this study and received a task-switching paradigm. No specific deficit in executive control was observed at the behavioral level in children with SLI. However, the neuroimaging data did show remarkable differences between the SLI and control children. The children with SLI recruited frontal and cingulate areas, normally associated with executive control, even when the task did not require them in the children without SLI. This might indicate that the task was more demanding for the SLI group and that compensatory mechanisms were engaged for successful task performance. ",

post-error slowing","A hallmark of cognitive control is the ability to rein in impulsive responses. Previously, we used a Bayesian model to describe trial-by-trial likelihood of the stop signal or p(Stop) and related regional activations to p(Stop) to response slowing in a stop signal task. Here, we characterized the regional processes of conflict anticipation in association with intersubject variation in impulse control in 114 young adults. We computed the stop signal reaction time (SSRT) and a measure of motor urgency, indexed by the reaction time (RT) difference between go and stop error trials or ""GoRT - SERT,"" where GoRT is the go trial RT and SERT is the stop error RT. Motor urgency and SSRT were positively correlated across subjects. A linear regression identified regional activations to p(Stop), each in correlation with SSRT and motor urgency. We hypothesized that shared neural activities mediate the correlation between motor urgency and SSRT in proactive control of impulsivity. Activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and right superior frontal gyrus (SFG) during conflict anticipation correlated negatively with the SSRT. Activation of the right SFG also correlated negatively with GoRT - SERT. Therefore, activation of the right SFG was associated with more efficient response inhibition and less motor urgency. A mediation analysis showed that right SFG activation to conflict anticipation mediates the correlation between SSRT and motor urgency bidirectionally. The current results highlight a specific role of the right SFG in translating conflict anticipation to the control of impulsive response, which is consistent with earlier studies suggesting its function in action restraint. Individuals vary in impulse control. However, the neural bases underlying individual variation in proactive control of impulsive responses remain unknown. Here, in a large sample of young adults, we showed that activation of the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG) during conflict anticipation is positively correlated with the capacity of inhibitory control and negatively with motor urgency in the stop signal task. Importantly, activity of the right SFG mediates the counteracting processes of inhibitory control and motor urgency across subjects. The results support a unique role of the right SFG in individual variation in cognitive control. ",

However, it is not clear to date how the risk level modulates brain activity during the decision-making process in IGD individuals. In this study, 23 adolescents with IGD and 24 healthy controls (HCs) without IGD were recruited, and the balloon analog risk task (BART) was used in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment to evaluate the modulation of the risk level (the probability of balloon explosion) on brain activity during risky decision making in IGD adolescents. Reduced modulation of the risk level on the activation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during the active BART was found in IGD group compared to the HCs. In the IGD group, there was a significant negative correlation between the risk-related DLPFC activation during the active BART and the Barratt impulsivity scale (BIS-11) scores, which were significantly higher in IGD group compared with the HCs. Our study demonstrated that, as a critical decision-making-related brain region, the right DLPFC is less sensitive to risk in IGD adolescents compared with the HCs, which may contribute to the higher impulsivity level in IGD adolescents.

Very few studies have employed the IGT in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) investigations, in part, because the task is cognitively complex. Here we report a method for exploring brain activity using fMRI during performance of the IGT. Decision-making during the IGT was associated with activity in several brain regions in a group of healthy individuals. The activated regions were consistent with the neural circuitry hypothesized to underlie somatic marker activation and decision-making. Specifically, a neural circuitry involving the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (for working memory), the insula and posterior cingulate cortex (for representations of emotional states), the mesial orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (for coupling the two previous processes), the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate/SMA (supplementary motor area) for implementing behavioral decisions was engaged. These results have implications for using the IGT to study abnormal mechanisms of decision making in a variety of clinical populations. ",

Few studies have systematically explored the relationships between patterns of gambling and health status. Existing data support the notion that some gambling behaviors, particularly problem and pathological gambling, are associated with nongambling health problems. The purpose of this article is to provide a perspective on the relationship between gambling behaviors and substance use disorders, review the data regarding health associations and screening and treatment options for problem and pathological gambling, and suggest a role for generalist physicians in assessing problem and pathological gambling. A rationale for conceptualization of pathological gambling as an addictive disorder and a model proposing stress as a possible mediating factor in the relationship between gambling and health status are presented. More research is needed to investigate directly the biological and health correlates associated with specific types of gambling behaviors and to define the role for generalist physicians in the prevention and treatment of problem and pathological gambling.

Recently, cognitive-coping therapy (CCT), mainly focusing on recognizing and coping with a fear of negative events, has been reported as an efficacious psychotherapy. However, the underlying neurophysiological mechanism remains unknown. This study of 79 OCD patients collected Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scans before and after four weeks of CCT, pharmacotherapy plus CCT (pCCT), or pharmacotherapy. Amygdala seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis was performed. Compared post- to pretreatment, pCCT-treated patients showed decreased left amygdala (LA) FC with the right anterior cingulate gyrus (cluster 1) and with the left paracentral lobule/the parietal lobe (cluster 2), while CCT-treated patients showed decreased LA-FC with the left middle occipital gyrus/the left superior parietal/left inferior parietal (cluster 3). The z-values of LA-FC with the three clusters were significantly lower after pCCT or CCT than pretreatment in comparisons of covert vs. overt and of non-remission vs. remission patients, except the z-value of cluster 2 in covert OCD. CCT and pCCT significantly reduced the Y-BOCS score. The reduction in the Y-BOCS score was positively correlated with the z-value of cluster 1. Our findings demonstrate that both pCCT and CCT with large effect sizes lowered LA-FC, indicating that FCs were involved in OCD. Additionally, decreased LA-FC with the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) or paracentral/parietal cortex may be a marker for pCCT response or a marker for distinguishing OCD subtypes. Decreased LA-FC with the parietal region may be a common pathway of pCCT and CCT. Trial registration: ChiCTR-IPC-15005969. ",
pmid_20579005,Altered neural response of the appetitive emotional system in cocaine addiction: an fMRI Study.,,"Research on addiction suggests that emotional alterations play an essential role in the development, maintenance, relapse and treatment outcome of substance abuse disorders. Although many neuroimaging studies focussed on the neural response to conditioned stimuli, much less is known about the neural response to natural affective stimuli in this pathological population. Previous research has demonstrated an altered emotional experience and autonomic response to emotional stimuli using the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) in drug abusers. Here we aimed, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to study the alterations in the neural responsitivity to pleasant (erotic), unpleasant and neutral IAPS stimuli in cocaine addiction. Thirty-two cocaine-dependent subjects and 26 matched controls completed an fMRI session during the presentation of a set of IAPS pictures as background, while performing a letter discrimination task. Consistent with previous studies, emotional pictures activated an emotional network including amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex and occipito-temporal areas in both groups. However, compared with controls, the cocaine group showed a significant hypoactivation of the dorsal and ventral striatum (including the nucleus accumbens), thalamus, parietal cortex and dorso-medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) when processing pleasant pictures. The analysis of pleasant versus unpleasant stimuli suggested that between-group differences in the dmPFC and striatal activation may be attributed to arousal processing rather than valence. These results could reflect the neural basis for the reduced ability of cocaine-dependent subjects to experience pleasure by daily natural reinforcers, suggesting that these alterations in the emotion processing may play an important role in drug dependence, treatment and relapse.

This paper reviews studies on neuropsychological functioning, brain structure, brain function, and subjective and objective measures of sleep in relation to adolescent marijuana use. Adolescents who use marijuana heavily tend to show disadvantaged attention, learning, and processing speed; subtle abnormalities in brain structure; increased activation during cognitive tasks despite intact performance; and compromised objective indicators of sleep quality. Some abnormalities appear to persist beyond a month of abstinence, but may resolve within three months if cessation is maintained. Recommendations for future studies include characterizing these indices in youth prior to the onset of marijuana use then examining change after chronic use has started, and using large samples of youth with varying degrees of involvement with marijuana as well as alcohol, nicotine, and other drugs to characterize the interactive influences on neurocognition and neural health.

In this study we detail the aspects of attention that covary with the chronic use of cannabis throughout adolescence. We compared performance and brain activation differences in tasks involving attention between young adults with a history of chronic cannabis use during adolescence and matched non-user control subjects. Two tasks were used to activate attention networks: the Attention Network Task (ANT) and the use generation task. In the ANT, chronic users (N=14) differed from controls (N=14) in showing poorer performance (longer reaction time and more errors) on tasks requiring processing of incongruent stimuli reflecting the executive attention network, but not in networks related to alerting or orienting components of attention. Functional MRI of brain activity showed stronger activation within the right prefrontal cortex in chronic users compared to the control group specifically on ANT trials requiring executive attention. The use generation task also revealed significantly stronger activation of the same right prefrontal area in users compared to controls. These results suggest that chronic cannabis users have less efficient executive attention in conflict resolution tasks, demanding more activation in the right prefrontal areas to resolve conflict.

pmid_17948888,Neural correlates of strategic memory retrieval: differentiating between spatial-associative and temporal-associative strategies.,,"Remembering complex, multidimensional information typically requires strategic memory retrieval, during which information is structured, for instance by spatial- or temporal associations. Although brain regions involved in strategic memory retrieval in general have been identified, differences in retrieval operations related to distinct retrieval strategies are not well-understood. Thus, our aim was to identify brain regions whose activity is differentially involved in spatial-associative and temporal-associative retrieval. First, we showed that our behavioral paradigm probing memory for a set of object-location associations promoted the use of a spatial-associative structure following an encoding condition that provided multiple associations to neighboring objects (spatial-associative condition) and the use of a temporal-associative structure following another study condition that provided predominantly temporal associations between sequentially presented items (temporal-associative condition). Next, we used an adapted version of this paradigm for functional MRI, where we contrasted brain activity related to the recall of object-location associations that were either encoded in the spatial- or the temporal-associative condition. In addition to brain regions generally involved in recall, we found that activity in higher-order visual regions, including the fusiform gyrus, the lingual gyrus, and the cuneus, was relatively enhanced when subjects used a spatial-associative structure for retrieval. In contrast, activity in the globus pallidus and the thalamus was relatively enhanced when subjects used a temporal-associative structure for retrieval. In conclusion, we provide evidence for differential involvement of these brain regions related to different types of strategic memory retrieval and the neural structures described play a role in either spatial-associative or temporal-associative memory retrieval.

pmid_12457757,Memory orientation and success: separable neurocognitive components underlying episodic recognition.,,"Episodic recognition can be based on recollection of contextual details, on a sense of recent encounter, or some combination of the two. According to several cognitive models, selectively attending to these distinct aspects of memory may require different retrieval orientations and result in different neural responses depending upon whether or not retrieval is successful. Using event-related fMRI, we examined retrieval orientation by having subjects discriminate between two test words in one of two manners. During source recollection, they selected the member of the pair previously associated with a particular encoding task. In contrast, recency judgment required selection of the most recently encountered item of the pair, regardless of how it had been encoded. Furthermore, successful and unsuccessful trials within each retrieval task were contrasted to determine whether retrieval success effects occurred in overlapping or dissimilar neural populations compared to those associated with each retrieval orientation. The results revealed distinct lateral prefrontal and parietal activations that distinguished attempted source recollection from judgments of relative recency; these orientation effects were largely independent of retrieval success. In contrast, medial temporal lobe structures (hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus) were differentially more active during successful recollection of encoding context, showing similar reduced responses during failed source recollection and judgments of recency. These results indicate that different memory orientations recruit distinct prefrontal and parietal networks and that the recovery of episodic context is associated with the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal cortices.

pmid_22535198,Functional neuroimaging of major depressive disorder: a meta-analysis and new integration of base line activation and neural response data.,,"Functional neuroimaging investigations of major depressive disorder can advance both the neural theory and treatment of this debilitating illness. Inconsistency of neuroimaging findings and the use of region-of-interest approaches have hindered the development of a comprehensive, empirically informed neural model of major depression. In this context, the authors sought to identify reliable anomalies in baseline neural activity and neural response to affective stimuli in major depressive disorder. The authors applied voxel-wise, whole-brain meta-analysis to neuroimaging investigations comparing depressed to healthy comparison groups with respect to baseline neural activity or neural response to positively and/or negatively valenced stimuli. Relative to healthy subjects, those with major depression had reliably higher baseline activity, bilaterally, in the pulvinar nucleus. The analysis of neural response studies using negative stimuli showed greater response in the amygdala, insula, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and lower response in the dorsal striatum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in individuals with major depressive disorder than in healthy subjects. The meta-analytic results support an elegant and neuroanatomically viable model of the salience of negative information in major depressive disorder. In this proposed model, high baseline pulvinar activity in depression first potentiates responding of the brain's salience network to negative information; next, and owing potentially to low striatal dopamine levels in depression, this viscerally charged information fails to propagate up the cortical-striatal-pallidalthalamic circuit to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for contextual processing and reappraisal.

pmid_16350973,Residual auditory function in persistent vegetative state: a combined PET and fMRI study.,,"In recent years, a number of studies have demonstrated an important role for functional neuroimaging in the identification of residual cognitive function in persistent vegetative state. Such studies, when successful, may be particularly useful where there is concern about the accuracy of the diagnosis and the possibility that residual cognitive function has remained undetected. Unfortunately, functional neuroimaging in persistent vegetative state is extremely complex and subject to numerous methodological, clinical and theoretical difficulties. Here, we describe the strategy used to study residual auditory and speech processing in a single patient with a clinical diagnosis of persistent vegetative state. Identical positron emission tomography studies, conducted nine months apart, revealed preserved and consistent responses in predicted regions of auditory cortex in response to intelligible speech stimuli. Moreover, a preliminary functional magnetic resonance imaging examination at the time of the second session revealed partially intact responses to semantically ambiguous stimuli, which are known to tap higher aspects of speech comprehension. In spite of the multiple logistic and procedural problems involved, these results have major clinical and theoretical implications and provide a strong basis for the systematic study of possible residual cognitive function in patients diagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative state.

pmid_20980667,A network approach to assessing cognition in disorders of consciousness.,,"Conventional assessments of consciousness rely on motor responses to indicate awareness. However, overt behaviors may be absent or ambiguous in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) resulting in underrating capacity for cognition. fMRI during a silent picture-naming task was evaluated as an indicator of command following when conventional methods are not sufficient. A total of 10 patients with and without conventional evidence of awareness, who met diagnostic criteria for the minimally conscious state (MCS) (n = 5), vegetative state (VS) (n = 3), emerged from MCS (EMCS) (n = 1), and locked-in syndrome (LIS) (n = 1), participated in this observational fMRI study. The LIS and EMCS patients engaged a complete network of essential language-related regions during the object-naming task. The MCS and 2 of the VS patients demonstrated both complete and partial preservation of the object-naming system. Patients who engaged a complete network scored highest on the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised. This study supports the view that fMRI during object naming can elicit brain activations in patients with DOC similar to those observed in healthy subjects during command following, and patients can be stratified by completeness of the engaged neural system. These results suggest that activity of the language network may serve as an indicator of high-level cognition and possibly volitional processes that cannot be discerned through conventional behavioral assessment alone.

An important question of potential future clinical relevance is whether these two overlapping disorders are mediated by similar or distinct underlying brain substrates. This article reviews the modern neuroimaging literature on brain structure, function, and connectivity in both disorders, shaping out commonalities and differences. Findings show that ADHD is characterized predominantly by abnormalities in inferior frontal, striatal, parietotemporal, and cerebellar regions and networks that mediate ""cool""-cognitive, i.e., inhibitory, attention and timing functions associated with the disorder. Conduct disorder, by contrast, has consistently been associated with abnormalities of the ""hot"" paralimbic system that regulates motivation and affect, comprising lateral orbital and ventromedial prefrontal cortices, superior temporal lobes, and underlying limbic structures, most prominently the amygdala. Direct comparisons in functional imaging show that these associations of cool inferior fronto-striato-cerebellar dysfunction in ADHD and of hot orbitofrontal-paralimbic dysfunction in conduct disorder are disorder-specific. There is, hence, evidence for dissociated underlying pathophysiologies for these two disorders that may have implications for future anatomy-based differential diagnosis and prevention and intervention.

pmid_21334445,Dissociable networks involved in spatial and temporal order source retrieval.,,"Space and time are important components of our episodic memories. Without this information, we cannot determine the ""where and when"" of our recent memories, rendering it difficult to disambiguate individual episodes from each other. The neural underpinnings of spatial and temporal order memory in humans remain unclear, in part because of difficulties in disentangling the contributions of these two types of source information. To address this issue, we conducted an experiment in which participants first navigated a virtual city, experiencing unique routes in a specific temporal order and learning about the spatial layout of the city. Spatial and temporal order information were dissociated in our task such that learning one type of information did not facilitate the other behaviorally. This allowed us to then address the extent to which the two types of information involved functionally distinct or overlapping brain areas. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), participants retrieved information about the relative distance of stores within the city (spatial task) and the temporal order of stores from each other (temporal task). Comparable hippocampal activity was observed during these two tasks, but greater prefrontal activity was seen during temporal order retrieval whereas greater parahippocampal activity was seen during spatial retrieval. We suggest that while the brain possesses dissociable networks for maintaining and representing spatial layout and temporal order components of episodic memory, this information may converge into a common representation for source memory in areas such as the hippocampus.

short-term plasticity","Neuroimaging studies have consistently shown that working memory (WM) tasks engage a distributed neural network that primarily includes the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the parietal cortex, and the anterior cingulate cortex. The current challenge is to provide a mechanistic account of the changes observed in regional activity. To achieve this, we characterized neuroplastic responses in effective connectivity between these regions at increasing WM loads using dynamic causal modeling of functional magnetic resonance imaging data obtained from healthy individuals during a verbal n-back task. Our data demonstrate that increasing memory load was associated with (a) right-hemisphere dominance, (b) increasing forward (i.e., posterior to anterior) effective connectivity within the WM network, and (c) reduction in individual variability in WM network architecture resulting in the right-hemisphere forward model reaching an exceedance probability of 99% in the most demanding condition. Our results provide direct empirical support that task difficulty, in our case WM load, is a significant moderator of short-term plasticity, complementing existing theories of task-related reduction in variability in neural networks.

fMRI","Background In recent years, the prescription of serotonin-noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for treatment of fibromyalgia (FM) has increased with reports of their efficacy. The SNRI milnacipran is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of FM, yet, the mechanisms by which milnacipran reduces FM symptoms are unknown. A large number of neuroimaging studies have demonstrated altered brain function in patients with FM but the effect of milnacipran on central pain processing has not been investigated. The primary objective of this study was to assess the effect of milnacipran on sensitivity to pressure-evoked pain in FM. Secondary objectives were to assess the effect of milnacipran on cerebral processing of pressure-evoked pain using fMRI and the tolerability and safety of milnacipran 200 mg/day in FM. Methods 92 patients were randomized to either 13-weeks milnacipran treatment (200 mg/day) or placebo in this double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial. Psychophysical measures and functional MRI (fMRI) assessments were performed before and after treatment using a computer-controlled pressure-pain stimulator. Here, we present the results of several a priori defined statistical analyses. Results Milnacipran-treated patients displayed a trend toward lower pressure-pain sensitivity after treatment, compared to placebo, and the difference was greater at higher pain intensities. A single group fMRI analysis of milnacipran-treated patients indicated increased pain-evoked brain activity in the caudatus nucleus, anterior insula and amygdala after treatment, compared to before treatment; regions implicated in pain inhibitory processes. A 2 × 2 repeated measures fMRI analysis, comparing milnacipran and placebo, before and after treatment, showed that milnacipran-treated patients had greater pain-evoked activity in the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex after treatment; a region previously implicated in intrinsic brain function and FM pathology. This finding was only significant when uncorrected for multiple comparisons. The safety analysis revealed that patients from both treatment groups had treatment-emergent adverse events where nausea was the most common complaint, reported by 43.5% of placebo patients and 71.7% of milnacipran-treated patients. Patients on milnacipran were more likely to discontinue treatment because of side effects. Conclusions Our results provide preliminary indications of increased pain inhibitory responses in milnacipran-treated FM patients, compared to placebo. The psychophysical assessments did not reach statistical significance but reveal a trend toward higher pressure-pain tolerance after treatment with milnacipran, compared to placebo, especially for higher pain intensities. Our fMRI analyses point toward increased activation of the precuneus/posterior cingulum in patients treated with milnacipran, however results were not corrected for multiple comparisons. The precuneus/posterior cingulum is a key region of the default mode network and has previously been associated with abnormal function in FM. Future studies may further explore activity within the default mode network as a potential biomarker for abnormal central pain processing. Implications The present study provides novel insights for future studies where functional neuroimaging may be used to elucidate the central mechanisms of common pharmacological treatments for chronic pain. Furthermore, our results point toward a potential mechanism for pain normalization in response to milnacipran, involving regions of the default mode network although this finding needs to be replicated in future studies.

pmid_22266175,Estradiol treatment altered anticholinergic-related brain activation during working memory in postmenopausal women.,,"Estradiol has been shown to affect cholinergic modulation of cognition in human and nonhuman animal models. This study examined the brain-based interaction of estradiol treatment and anticholinergic challenge in postmenopausal women during the performance of a working memory task and functional MRI. Twenty-four postmenopausal women were randomly and blindly placed on 1mg oral 17-β estradiol or matching placebo pills for three months after which they participated in three anticholinergic challenge sessions. During the challenge sessions, subjects were administered the antimuscarinic drug scopolamine, the antinicotinic drug mecamylamine, or placebo. After drug administration, subjects completed an fMRI session during which time they performed a visual verbal N-back test of working memory. Results showed that scopolamine increased activation in the left medial frontal gyrus (BA 10) and mecamylamine increased activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 46). Estradiol treatment compared to placebo treatment significantly reduced the activation in this left medial frontal region during scopolamine challenge. Estradiol treatment also increased activation in the precuneus (BA 31) during mecamylamine challenge. These data are the first to show that estradiol modulated antimuscarinic- and anitnicotinic-induced brain activity and suggest that estradiol affected cholinergic system regulation of cognition-related brain activation in humans.

However, they know little about how this process varies across age and with development. Using cross-sectional fMRI data, they examined cerebellar response to biological (BIO) versus scrambled (SCRAM) motion within typically developing (TD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) samples (age 4-30 years old), characterizing cerebellar response and BIO > SCRAM-selective effective connectivity, as well as associations with age and social ability. TD individuals recruited regions throughout cerebellar posterior lobe during BIO > SCRAM, especially bilateral lobule VI, and demonstrated connectivity with right posterior superior temporal sulcus (RpSTS) in left VI, Crus I/II, and VIIIb. ASD individuals showed BIO > SCRAM activity in left VI and left Crus I/II, and bilateral connectivity with RpSTS in Crus I/II and VIIIb/IX. No between-group differences emerged in well-matched subsamples. Among TD individuals, older age predicted greater BIO > SCRAM response in left VIIb and left VIIIa/b, but reduced connectivity between RpSTS and widespread regions of the right cerebellum. In ASD, older age predicted greater response in left Crus I and bilateral Crus II, but decreased effective connectivity with RpSTS in bilateral Crus I/II. In ASD, increased BIO > SCRAM signal in left VI/Crus I and right Crus II, VIIb, and dentate predicted lower social symptomaticity; increased effective connectivity with RpSTS in right Crus I/II and bilateral VI and I-V predicted greater symptomaticity. These data suggest that posterior cerebellum contributes to the neurodevelopment of social perception in both basic and clinical populations.

Studies of the resting brain have shown both altered baseline metabolism from PET/SPECT and altered functional connectivity (FC) of intrinsic brain networks based on resting-state fMRI. To date, however, no study has investigated these two physiological parameters of resting brain function jointly, or explored the relationship between these measures and ASD symptom severity. Here, we used pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling with 3D background-suppressed GRASE to assess resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) and FC in 17 youth with ASD and 22 matched typically developing (TD) children. A pattern of altered resting perfusion was found in ASD versus TD children including frontotemporal hyperperfusion and hypoperfusion in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. We found increased local FC in the anterior module of the default mode network (DMN) accompanied by decreased CBF in the same area. In our cohort, both alterations were associated with greater social impairments as assessed with the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-total T scores). While FC was correlated with CBF in TD children, this association between FC and baseline perfusion was disrupted in children with ASD. Furthermore, there was reduced long-range FC between anterior and posterior modules of the DMN in children with ASD. Taken together, the findings of this study--the first to jointly assess resting CBF and FC in ASD--highlight new avenues for identifying novel imaging markers of ASD symptomatology. ",
pmid_22205646,Distributed sensitivity for movement amplitude in directionally tuned neuronal populations.,,"Neurons in macaque primary motor cortex and dorsal premotor cortex are tuned to movement direction. In humans, neuronal populations tuned to movement direction have recently been described using multivoxel pattern analysis and functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation. It is unclear, however, to what extent directionally tuned neuronal populations are sensitive to movement amplitude. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation to determine whether directionally tuned neuronal populations are modulated by movement amplitude. In different blocks, participants were adapted to small- or large-amplitude hand-reaching movements. On occasional test trials, we parametrically varied the angular difference between adaptation and test direction and the congruency between adapted and tested amplitude (same or different). We predicted that the blood oxygen level-dependent signal in directionally tuned regions should be adapted in proportion to the angular difference between adaptation and test direction. Directionally tuned regions insensitive to movement amplitude should show a transfer of adaptation from the adapted to the nonadapted amplitude. In contrast, regions sensitive to the specific combination of movement direction and amplitude should show directional tuning only for the adapted amplitude. We identified a network of parietal and frontal regions tuned to movement direction. We found that parietal areas contain neuronal populations sensitive to specific combinations of movement direction and amplitude, while frontal areas show transfer from the adapted to the nonadapted amplitude during small-amplitude movements after adaptation to large amplitude, but not vice versa. Our results thus imply different processing of movement amplitude in directionally tuned frontal and parietal areas. ",
pmid_16525800,Precuneus is involved in allocentric spatial location encoding and recognition.,,"Using a declarative memory paradigm, the anatomical correlates of spatial location encoding and retrieval in the healthy human brain as reflected by BOLD fMRI were investigated. During encoding, subjects were instructed to view and keep in mind different locations of an object on a platform seen from different viewpoints in virtual 3D. In retrieval trials, subjects had to recognize previously learned object locations. Comparing activation patterns associated with encoding and recognition on a voxel-by-voxel basis, we found regions in the precuneus bilaterally activated by both processes. To our knowledge, this is the first study that directly compared human brain activation patterns associated with allocentric encoding and retrieval of spatial locations in virtual 3D. Our results provide further information concerning the role of the precuneus in declarative memory processes, pointing to precuneus involvement in encoding and retrieval of spatial locations. ",

Abnormal structural and functional alterations related to the thalamus have been well established. However, it is unknown whether the brain structure and function of the thalamic subregions are differentially affected in this disorder. In this study, we aimed to clarify this issue by comparing the structure and function of 16 thalamic subregions between patients with episodic migraine (EM) and healthy controls (HCs). Twenty-seven patients with EM and 30 sex-, age- and education-matched HCs underwent resting-state functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging scans. Functional connectivity (rsFC), grey matter volume (GMV), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters of each subregion of the thalamus were calculated and compared between the two groups. Furthermore, correlation analyses between neuroimaging changes and clinical features were performed in this study. First, compared with HCs, patients with EM exhibited decreased rsFC between the anterior-medial-posterior subregions of the thalamus and brain regions mainly involved in the medial system of the pain processing pathway and default mode network (DMN). Second, for the whole thalamus and each of its subregions, there were no significant differences in GMV between patients with EM and HCs (P > 0.05, Bonferroni corrected). Third, there was no significant difference in DTI parameters between the two groups (P > 0.05). Finally, decreased rsFC was closely related to scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAMA) and Big Five Inventory (BFI) scales. Selective functional hypoconnectivity in the thalamic subregions provides neuroimaging evidence supporting the important role of thalamocortical pathway dysfunction in episodic migraine, specifically, that it may modulate emotion and different personality traits in migraine patients.

Response inhibition is a hallmark of ADHD, yet the combined effects of ADHD and regular substance use on neural networks associated with response inhibition are unknown. Task-based functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data from young adults with childhood ADHD with (n = 25) and without (n = 25) cannabis use ≥ monthly in the past year were compared with a local normative comparison group (LNCG) with (n = 11) and without (n = 12) cannabis use. Go/NoGo behavioral and fMRI data were evaluated for main and interaction effects of ADHD diagnosis and cannabis use. ADHD participants made significantly more commission errors on NoGo trials than controls. ADHD participants also had less frontoparietal and frontostriatal activity, independent of cannabis use. No main effects of cannabis use on response inhibition or functional brain activation were observed. An interaction of ADHD diagnosis and cannabis use was found in the right hippocampus and cerebellar vermis, with increased recruitment of these regions in cannabis-using controls during correct response inhibition. ADHD participants had impaired response inhibition combined with less fronto-parietal/striatal activity, regardless of cannabis use history. Cannabis use did not impact behavioral response inhibition. Cannabis use was associated with hippocampal and cerebellar activation, areas rich in cannabinoid receptors, in LNCG but not ADHD participants. This may reflect recruitment of compensatory circuitry in cannabis using controls but not ADHD participants. Future studies targeting hippocampal and cerebellar-dependent function in these groups may provide further insight into how this circuitry is altered by ADHD and cannabis use. ",

However, most previous studies just focus on group-level aberrance of a single modality ignoring heterogeneity and multimodal features. On that account, we aimed to uncover OCD subtypes integrating structural and functional neuroimaging features with the help of a multiview learning method and examined multimodal aberrance for each subtype. Ninety-nine first-episode untreated patients with OCD and 104 matched healthy controls (HCs) undergoing structural and functional MRI were included in this study. Voxel-based morphometric and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) were adopted to assess gray matter volumes (GMVs) and the spontaneous neuronal fluctuations respectively. Structural/functional distance network was obtained by calculating Euclidean distance between pairs of regional GMVs/ALFF values across patients. Similarity network fusion, one of multiview learning methods capturing shared and complementary information from multimodal data sources, was used to fuse multimodal distance networks into one fused network. Then spectral clustering was adopted to categorize patients into subtypes. As a result, two robust subtypes were identified. These two subtypes presented opposite GMV aberrance and distinct ALFF aberrance compared with HCs while shared indistinguishable clinical and demographic features. In addition, these two subtypes exhibited opposite structure-function difference correlation reflecting distinct adaptive modifications between multimodal aberrance. Altogether, these results uncover two objective subtypes with distinct multimodal aberrance and provide a new insight into taxonomy of OCD. ",

Research has not established which neuropsychological mechanisms support lending decisions, nor whether their influence extends to markets involving significant financial incentives. In two studies, we found that neural affective mechanisms influence the success of requests for microloans. In a large Internet database of microloan requests (N = 13,500), we found that positive affective features of photographs promoted the success of those requests. We then established that neural activity (i.e., in the nucleus accumbens) and self-reported positive arousal in a neuroimaging sample (N = 28) predicted the success of loan requests on the Internet, above and beyond the effects of the neuroimaging sample's own choices (i.e., to lend or not). These findings suggest that elicitation of positive arousal can promote the success of loan requests, both in the laboratory and on the Internet. They also highlight affective neuroscience's potential to probe neuropsychological mechanisms that drive microlending, enhance the effectiveness of loan requests, and forecast market-level behavior.

Statistical parametric mapping 8, data processing assistant for resting-state fMRI analysis toolkit, and resting state fMRI data analysis toolkit packages were used to process the fMRI data on Matlab 2012a platform, and the difference of regional homogeneity (ReHo) values between the OCD group and HC group was detected with independent two-sample  Compared with HC group, the ReHo values in OCD group were decreased in brain regions, including left thalamus, right thalamus, right paracentral lobule, right postcentral gyrus, and the ReHo value was increased in the left angular gyrus region. There was a negative correlation between disease duration and ReHo value in the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). OCD is a multifactorial disease generally caused by abnormal activities of many brain regions at resting state. Worse brain activity of the OFC is related to the OCD duration, which provides a new insight to the pathogenesis of OCD. ",
pmid_23426687,Reputational priors magnify striatal responses to violations of trust.,,"Humans learn to trust each other by evaluating the outcomes of repeated interpersonal interactions. However, available prior information on the reputation of traders may alter the way outcomes affect learning. Our functional magnetic resonance imaging study is the first to allow the direct comparison of interaction-based and prior-based learning. Twenty participants played repeated trust games with anonymous counterparts. We manipulated two experimental conditions: whether or not reputational priors were provided, and whether counterparts were generally trustworthy or untrustworthy. When no prior information is available our results are consistent with previous studies in showing that striatal activation patterns correlate with behaviorally estimated reinforcement learning measures. However, our study additionally shows that this correlation is disrupted when reputational priors on counterparts are provided. Indeed participants continue to rely on priors even when experience sheds doubt on their accuracy. Notably, violations of trust from a cooperative counterpart elicited stronger caudate deactivations when priors were available than when they were not. However, tolerance to such violations appeared to be mediated by prior-enhanced connectivity between the caudate nucleus and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, which anticorrelated with retaliation rates. Moreover, on top of affecting learning mechanisms, priors also clearly oriented initial decisions to trust, reflected in medial prefrontal cortex activity. ",
pmid_15588605,Cortical mechanisms of visual self-recognition.,,"Several lines of evidence have suggested that visual self-recognition is supported by a special brain mechanism; however, its functional anatomy is of great controversy. We performed an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to identify brain regions selectively involved in recognition of one's own face. We presented pictures of each subject's own face (SELF) and a prelearned face of an unfamiliar person (CONT), as well as two personally familiar faces with high and low familiarity (HIGH and LOW, respectively) to test selectivity of activation to the SELF face. Compared with the CONT face, activation selective to the SELF face was observed in the right occipito-temporo-parietal junction and frontal operculum, as well as in the left fusiform gyrus. On the contrary, the temporoparietal junction in both the hemispheres and the left anterior temporal cortex, which were activated during recognition of HIGH and/or LOW faces, were not activated during recognition of the SELF face. The results confirmed the partial distinction of the brain mechanism involved in recognition of personally familiar faces and that in recognition of one's own face. The right occipito-temporo-parietal junction and frontal operculum appear to compose a network processing motion-action contingency, a role of which in visual self-recognition has been suggested in previous behavioral studies. Activation of the left fusiform gyrus selective to one's own face was consistent with the results of two previous functional imaging studies and a neuropsychological report, possibly suggesting its relationship with lexical processing.

Cognitive improvement in younger postmenopausal women has been attributed to ET's influence on hot flushes and sleep, but empiric examination of the mediating role of menopause symptoms versus direct effects of ET on the brain is limited. In a double-blind trial, 52 women were randomly assigned to estradiol 0.05 mg/day (n = 26) or placebo transdermal patches (n = 26) for 12 weeks. Women completed tests of memory, learning, and executive functioning, and hot flush and sleep assessments at baseline and study end. A subset of women (five ET treated, six placebo treated) also underwent blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. Nondepressed perimenopausal and postmenopausal women were studied. The majority had hot flushes and sleep impairment. Compared with placebo, ET selectively reduced errors of perseveration during verbal recall (P = 0.03), a frontal system-mediated function, but did not influence other cognitive processes. Women with baseline hot flushes had greater cognitive benefit with ET (P < 0.05). Cognitive benefit was not associated with sleep problems or its improvement. Measures of fMRI BOLD activation during tests of verbal and spatial working memory showed significant increases in frontal system activity with ET (P < 0.001). Estrogen therapy selectively improves executive functioning as demonstrated by reduced perseverative errors and prefrontal cortex activation during verbal recall tasks. Cognitive improvement with ET is associated with hot flushes, but not with sleep, suggesting that ET has a direct central nervous system effect, rather than an indirect effect mediated through improvement of sleep.

To address these questions using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), participants up- and down-regulated negative emotion either by focusing internally on the self-relevance of aversive scenes or by focusing externally on alternative meanings for pictured actions and their situational contexts. Results indicated (1a) that both up- and down-regulating negative emotion recruited prefrontal and anterior cingulate regions implicated in cognitive control, (1b) that amygdala activation was modulated up or down in accord with the regulatory goal, and (1c) that up-regulation uniquely recruited regions of left rostromedial PFC implicated in the retrieval of emotion knowledge, whereas down-regulation uniquely recruited regions of right lateral and orbital PFC implicated in behavioral inhibition. Results also indicated that (2) self-focused regulation recruited medial prefrontal regions implicated in internally focused processing, whereas situation-focused regulation recruited lateral prefrontal regions implicated in externally focused processing. These data suggest that both common and distinct neural systems support various forms of reappraisal and that which particular prefrontal systems modulate the amygdala in different ways depends on the regulatory goal and strategy employed.

pmid_22663946,Comparison of brain volume abnormalities between ADHD and conduct disorder in adolescence.,,"Previous studies of brain structure abnormalities in conduct disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) samples have been limited owing to cross-comorbidity, preventing clear understanding of which structural brain abnormalities might be specific to or shared by each disorder. To our knowledge, this study was the first direct comparison of grey and white matter volumes in diagnostically ""pure"" (i.e., no comorbidities) conduct disorder and ADHD samples. Groups of adolescents with noncormobid conduct disorder and with noncomorbid, combined-subtype ADHD were compared with age- and sex-matched controls using DARTEL voxel-based analysis of T1-weighted brain structure images. Analysis of variance with post hoc analyses compared whole brain grey and white matter volumes among the groups. We included 24 adolescents in each study group. There was an overall 13% reduction in grey matter volume in adolescents with conduct disorder, reflecting numerous frontal, temporal, parietal and subcortical deficits. The same grey matter regions typically were not abnormal in those with ADHD. Deficits in frontal lobe regions previously identified in studies of patients with ADHD either were not detected, or group differences from controls were not as strong as those between the conduct disorder and control groups. White matter volume measurements did not differentiate conduct disorder and ADHD. Our modest sample sizes prevented meaningful examination of individual features of ADHD or conduct disorder, such as aggression, callousness, or hyperactive versus inattentive symptom subtypes. The evidence supports theories of frontotemporal abnormalities in adolescents with conduct disorder, but raises questions about the prominence of frontal lobe and striatal structural abnormalities in those with noncomorbid, combined-subtype ADHD. The latter point is clinically important, given the widely held belief that ADHD is associated with numerous frontal lobe structural deficits, a conclusion that is not strongly supported following direct comparison of diagnostically pure groups. The results are important for future etiological studies, particularly those seeking to identify how early expression of specific brain structure abnormalities could potentiate the risk for antisocial behaviour.

Methods One hundred patients and 46 matched HCs were recruited. Migraineurs were randomized to verum acupuncture, sham acupuncture, and waiting list groups. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected before and after longitudinal treatments. Independent component analysis was applied in the data analysis. Results We found that migraineurs showed decreased rs-fc between the rFPN and bilateral precuneus compared with HCs. After treatments (real and sham), rFPN rs-fc with the precuneus was significantly reduced. This reduction was associated with headache intensity relief. In order to explore the role of the precuneus in acupuncture modulation, we performed a seed-based rs-fc analysis using the precuneus as a seed and found that the precuneus rs-fc with the bilateral rostral anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was significantly enhanced after treatment. Conclusion Our results suggest that migraineurs are associated with abnormal rFPN rs-fc. An effective treatment, such as acupuncture, may relieve symptoms by strengthening the cognitive adaptation/coping process. Elucidation of the adaptation/coping mechanisms may open up a new window for migraine management. ",
pmid_17987058,Abnormal reward system activation in mania.,,"Transmission of reward signals is a function of dopamine, a neurotransmitter known to be involved in the mechanism of psychosis. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated how expectation and receipt of monetary rewards modulate brain activation in patients with bipolar mania and schizophrenia. We studied 12 acutely manic patients with a history of bipolar disorder, 12 patients with a current episode of schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia and 12 healthy subjects. All patients were treated with dopamine antagonists at the time of the study. Subjects performed a delayed incentive paradigm with monetary reward in the scanner that allowed for investigating effects of expectation, receipt, and omission of rewards. Patients with schizophrenia and healthy control subjects showed the expected activation of dopaminergic brain areas, that is, ventral tegmentum activation upon expectation of monetary rewards and nucleus accumbens activation during receipt vs omission of rewards. In manic patients, however, we did not find a similar pattern of brain activation and the differential signal in the nucleus accumbens upon receipt vs omission of rewards was significantly lower compared to the healthy control subjects. Our findings provide evidence for abnormal function of the dopamine system during receipt or omission of expected rewards in bipolar disorder. These deficits in prediction error processing in acute mania may help to explain symptoms of disinhibition and abnormal goal pursuit regulation. ",
pmid_22349801,Exploring the neural correlates of visual creativity.,,"Although creativity has been called the most important of all human resources, its neural basis is still unclear. In the current study, we used fMRI to measure neural activity in participants solving a visuospatial creativity problem that involves divergent thinking and has been considered a canonical right hemisphere task. As hypothesized, both the visual creativity task and the control task as compared to rest activated a variety of areas including the posterior parietal cortex bilaterally and motor regions, which are known to be involved in visuospatial rotation of objects. However, directly comparing the two tasks indicated that the creative task more strongly activated left hemisphere regions including the posterior parietal cortex, the premotor cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the medial PFC. These results demonstrate that even in a task that is specialized to the right hemisphere, robust parallel activity in the left hemisphere supports creative processing. Furthermore, the results support the notion that higher motor planning may be a general component of creative improvisation and that such goal-directed planning of novel solutions may be organized top-down by the left DLPFC and by working memory processing in the medial prefrontal cortex.

This study compares the neurofunctional modulation and normalization effects of acute doses of MPH and ATX within medication-naive ADHD boys during working memory (WM). A total of 20 medication-naive ADHD boys underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during a parametric WM n-back task three times, under a single clinical dose of either MPH, ATX or placebo in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. To test for normalization effects, brain activations in ADHD under each drug condition were compared with that of 20 age-matched healthy control boys. Relative to healthy boys, ADHD boys under placebo showed impaired performance only under high WM load together with significant underactivation in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Both drugs normalized the performance deficits relative to controls. ATX significantly enhanced right DLPFC activation relative to MPH within patients, and significantly normalized its underactivation relative to controls. MPH, by contrast, both relative to placebo and ATX, as well as relative to controls, upregulated the left inferior frontal cortex (IFC), but only during 2-back. Both drugs enhanced fronto-temporo-striatal activation in ADHD relative to control boys and deactivated the default-mode network, which were negatively associated with the reduced DLPFC activation and performance deficits, suggesting compensation effects. The study shows both shared and drug-specific effects. ATX upregulated and normalized right DLPFC underactivation, while MPH upregulated left IFC activation, suggesting drug-specific laterality effects on prefrontal regions mediating WM. ",
pmid_12372291,Executive control during episodic retrieval: multiple prefrontal processes subserve source memory.,,"During recognition, one may sense items as familiar (item memory) and additionally recollect specific contextual details of the earlier encounters (source memory). Cognitive theory suggests that, unlike item memory, source memory requires controlled cue specification and monitoring processes. Functional imaging suggests that such processes may depend on left prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, the nature and possible anatomical segregation of these processes remains unknown. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we isolated distinct response patterns in left PFC during source memory consistent with semantic analysis/cue specification (anterior ventrolateral), recollective monitoring (posterior dorsolateral and frontopolar), and phonological maintenance/rehearsal (posterior ventrolateral). Importantly, cue specification and recollective monitoring responses were not seen during item memory and were unaffected by retrieval success, demonstrating that the mere attempt to recollect episodic detail engages multiple control processes with different left PFC substrates.

fMRI","In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), cognition is affected. Cortical atrophy in frontal and temporal areas has been associated with the cognitive profile of patients. Additionally, reduced metabolic turnover and regional cerebral blood flow in frontal areas indicative of reduced neural activity have been reported for ALS. We hypothesize that functional connectivity in non-task associated functional default mode network (DMN) is associated with cognitive profile and white matter integrity. This study focused on specific cognitive tasks known to be impaired in ALS such as verbal fluency and attention, and the relationship with functional connectivity in the DMN and white matter integrity. Nine patients and 11 controls were measured with an extensive neuropsychological battery. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were acquired. Results showed that ALS patients performed significantly worse in attention and verbal fluency task. Patients showed increased functional connectivity in parahippocampal and parietal areas of the non-task associated DMN compared to controls. The more pronounced the cognitive deficits, the stronger the increase in functional connectivity in those areas. White matter integrity was reduced in frontal areas in the patients. In conclusion, increased connectivity in the DMN in parahippocampal and parietal areas might represent recruitment of accessory brain regions to compensate for dysfunctional frontal networks. ",

The present study evaluated the spontaneous neuronal activity of 31 patients with MCI using resting-state functional MRI. The patients were divided into two groups (17 MCI patients without diabetes, and 14 patients with type 2 diabetes who were considered as the MCI-DM group) and 17 well-matched healthy controls were also recruited. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of spontaneous blood oxygen level dependent signals was then applied to assess neuroimaging changes. To further investigate the impact of type 2 diabetes on cognition, the correlation of ALFF and the neuropsychological tests for the MCI-DM and MCI group were calculated. MCI-DM patients showed diffused ALFF changes in a variety of brain regions that were significantly related to cognitive performance, including the frontal lobe, the temporal lobe, the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the precuneus during a resting state; whereas, the alterations were much less pronounced in the MCI patients without diabetes. These findings provide new insights into understanding essential of diabetes mellitus and may help to clarify the relationship between diabetes mellitus and dementia. ",

Reward
fMRI","Neuroeconomics is providing insights into the neural bases of decision-making in normal and pathological conditions. In the neuropsychiatric domain, this discipline investigates how abnormal functioning of neural systems associated with reward processing and cognitive control promotes different disorders, and whether such evidence may inform treatments. This endeavor is crucial when studying different types of addiction, which share a core promoting mechanism in the imbalance between impulsive subcortical neural signals associated with immediate pleasurable outcomes and inhibitory signals mediated by a prefrontal reflective system. The resulting impairment in behavioral control represents a hallmark of alcohol use disorders (AUDs), a chronic relapsing disorder characterized by excessive alcohol consumption despite devastating consequences. This review aims to summarize available magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence on reward-related decision-making alterations in AUDs, and to envision possible future research directions. We review functional MRI (fMRI) studies using tasks involving monetary rewards, as well as MRI studies relating decision-making parameters to neurostructural gray- or white-matter metrics. The available data suggest that excessive alcohol exposure affects neural signaling within brain networks underlying adaptive behavioral learning via the implementation of prediction errors. Namely, weaker ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity and altered connectivity between ventral striatum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex likely underpin a shift from goal-directed to habitual actions which, in turn, might underpin compulsive alcohol consumption and relapsing episodes despite adverse consequences. Overall, these data highlight abnormal fronto-striatal connectivity as a candidate neurobiological marker of impaired choice in AUDs. Further studies are needed, however, to unveil its implications in the multiple facets of decision-making. ",

The behavior responses and brain activities of 17 participants were recorded by an MRI scanner while they performed a gambling task. Different conditions were compared to determine the effect of the task on the behavior and brain activity of the participants. Correlations between brain activity and behavior were calculated to support the imaging results. In win trials, LOSS caused less intense posterior cingulate activity than TIE. In lose trials, LOSS caused more intense activity in the right superior temporal gyrus, bilateral superior frontal gyrus, bilateral anterior cingulate, bilateral insula cortex, and left orbitofrontal cortex than WIN and TIE. The experiences of the participants in win trials showed great similarity among different win-lose situations. However, the brain activity and behavior responses of the participants in lose trials indicated that they experienced stronger negative emotion in LOSS. The participants also showed an increased desire to win in LOSS than in WIN or TIE conditions. ",

However, little is known regarding brain functional processes mediating ECT effects. In a non-randomized prospective study, functional magnetic resonance imaging data during the automatic processing of subliminally presented emotional faces were obtained twice, about 6 weeks apart, in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) before and after treatment with ECT (ECT, n = 24). Additionally, a control sample of MDD patients treated solely with pharmacotherapy (MED, n = 23) and a healthy control sample (HC, n = 22) were obtained. Before therapy, both patient groups equally showed elevated amygdala reactivity to sad faces compared with HC. After treatment, a decrease in amygdala activity to negative stimuli was discerned in both patient samples indicating a normalization of amygdala function, suggesting mechanisms potentially unspecific for ECT. Moreover, a decrease in amygdala activity to sad faces was associated with symptomatic improvements in the ECT sample (r spearman = -0.48, p = 0.044), and by tendency also for the MED sample (r spearman = -0.38, p = 0.098). However, we did not find any significant association between pre-treatment amygdala function to emotional stimuli and individual symptom improvement, neither for the ECT sample, nor for the MED sample. In sum, the present study provides first results regarding functional changes in emotion processing due to ECT treatment using a longitudinal design, thus validating and extending our knowledge gained from previous treatment studies. A limitation was that ECT patients received concurrent medication treatment. ",
pmid_12615645,Age-related changes in the neural correlates of motor performance.,,"Age-related neurodegenerative and neurochemical changes are thought to underlie decline in motor and cognitive functions, but compensatory processes in cortical and subcortical function may allow maintenance of performance level in some people. Our objective was to investigate age-related changes in the motor system of the human brain using functional MRI. Twenty six right handed volunteers were scanned whilst performing an isometric, dynamic, visually paced hand grip task, using dominant (right) and non-dominant (left) hands in separate sessions. Hand grip with visual feedback activated a network of cortical and subcortical regions known to be involved in the generation of simple motor acts. In addition, activation was seen in a putative human 'grasping circuit', involving rostral ventral premotor cortex (Brodmann area 44) and intraparietal sulcus. Within this network, a number of regions were more likely to be activated the older the subject. In particular, age-related changes in task- specific activations were demonstrated in left deep anterior central sulcus when using the dominant or non-dominant hand. Additional age-related increases were seen in caudal dorsal premotor cortex, caudal cingulate sulcus, intraparietal sulcus, insula, frontal operculum and cerebellar vermis. We have demonstrated a clear age-related effect in the neural correlates of motor performance, and furthermore suggest that these changes are non-linear. These results support the notion that an adaptable and plastic motor network is able to respond to age-related degenerative changes in order to maintain performance levels. ",
pmid_24738703,"Imaging the ADHD brain: disorder-specificity, medication effects and clinical translation.",,"A plethora of magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown that ADHD is characterized by multiple functional and structural neural network abnormalities beyond the classical fronto-striatal model, including fronto-parieto-temporal, fronto-cerebellar and even fronto-limbic networks. There is evidence for a maturational delay in brain structure development which likely extends to brain function and structural and functional connectivity, but this needs corroboration by longitudinal imaging studies. Dysfunction of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex seems to be more pronounced relative to other pediatric disorders and is also the most consistent target of acute psychostimulant medication. Future studies are likely to focus on using neuroimaging for clinical translation such as for individual diagnostic and prognostic classification and as a neurotherapy to reverse brain function abnormalities.

Here we investigated the effect of dopaminergic modulation on value-based decision-making for food items in fasted healthy human participants. The Becker-deGroot-Marschak auction, which assesses subjective value, was examined in conjunction with pharmacological fMRI using a dopaminergic agonist and an antagonist. We found that dopamine enhanced the neural response to value in the inferior parietal gyrus/intraparietal sulcus, and that this effect predominated toward the end of the valuation process when an action was needed to record the value. Our results suggest that dopamine is involved in acting upon the decision, providing additional insight to the mechanisms underlying impaired decision-making in healthy individuals and clinical populations with reduced dopamine levels.

pmid_18793658,Developmental topographical disorientation: case one.,,"Topographical disorientation is the inability to orient within the environment, usually acquired from lesions to different cerebral regions participating in the attentional, perceptual or memory functions involved during navigation. We present the first case of a patient with topographical disorientation in the absence of any structural lesion and with intact sensory and intellectual function. Experimental tests in both real and virtual environments revealed a selective impairment in forming a mental representation of the environment, namely a cognitive map. Consistent with the patient's behavioural findings, a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study showed lack of activation in the hippocampal complex and the retrosplenial cortex while forming a cognitive map of the environment. Although the lack of neural activity results in a negative finding that generally has low interpretative value, in this specific case our findings may provide useful information. First, in a group of healthy control subjects performing the same task, activity within the hippocampal complex and retrosplenial cortex were detected in each individual participant. Second, we found that within the same regions (showing lack of neural activity while forming a cognitive map of the environment) increased neural activity was detected while the patient was performing a different navigation task. This case is the first evidence reported in the literature showing that topographical disorientation may occur as a developmental defect causing a lifelong disorder affecting daily activities. ",

Here, we used voxel-based morphometry to investigate the effects of Val158Met polymorphism on grey matter (GM) volumes in a sample of 7-13-year-old children. MRI and genotype data were obtained for 38 children with combined-type ADHD and 24 typically developing (TD) children. Four regions of interest were identified: striatum, cerebellum, temporal lobe and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). When compared to TD children, those with ADHD had a significant decrease of GM volume in the IFG. Volume in this region was negatively correlated with ratings of hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms. Furthermore, the smaller GM volume in the IFG was attributed to the presence of the Met158-allele, as only children with ADHD carrying a Met158-allele exhibited such decrease in the IFG. Children with ADHD homozygotes for the Val158-allele presented increased GM volume in the caudate nucleus when compared with TD children. This study provides the first evidence of a modulation of ADHD-related GM volume alterations by Val158Met in two key regions, possibly mediating the relationship between Val158Met polymorphism and antisocial behaviour in children with ADHD.

pmid_18768646,The human dorsal stream adapts to real actions and 3D shape processing: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study.,,"We tested whether the control of real actions in an ever-changing environment would show any dependence on prior actions elicited by instructional cues a few seconds before. To this end, adaptation of the functional magnetic resonance imaging signal was measured while human participants sequentially grasped three-dimensional objects in an event-related design, using grasps oriented along the same or a different axis of either the same or a different object shape. We found that the bilateral anterior intraparietal sulcus, an area previously linked to the control of visually guided grasping, along with other areas of the intraparietal sulcus, the left supramarginal gyrus, and the right mid superior parietal lobe showed clear adaptation following both repeated grasps and repeated objects. In contrast, the left ventral premotor cortex and the bilateral dorsal premotor cortex, the two premotor areas often linked to response selection, action planning, and execution, showed only grasp-selective adaptation. These results suggest that, even in real action guidance, parietofrontal areas demonstrate differential involvement in visuomotor processing dependent on whether the action or the object has been previously experienced. ",
pmid_23201367,Cortical and subcortical responses to high and low effective placebo treatments.,,"The effectiveness of placebo treatments depends on the recipient's expectations, which are at least in part shaped by previous experiences. Thus, positive past experience together with an accordant verbal instruction should enhance outcome expectations and subsequently lead to higher placebo efficacy. This should be reflected in subjective valuation reports and in activation of placebo-related brain structures. We tested this hypothesis in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study, where subjects experienced different levels of pain relief and conforming information about price levels for two placebo treatments during a manipulation phase, thereby establishing a weak and a strong placebo. As expected, both placebos led to a significant pain relief and the strong placebo induced better analgesic efficacy. Individual placebo value estimates reflected treatment efficacy, i.e. subjects were willing to pay more money for the strong placebo even though pain stimulation was completed at this time. On the neural level, placebo effects were associated with activation of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, the anterior insula, and the ventral striatum and deactivations in the thalamus and secondary somatosensory cortex. However, only placebo-related responses in rostral anterior cingulate cortex were consistent across both the anticipation of painful stimuli and their actual administration. Most importantly, rostral anterior cingulate cortex responses were higher for the strong placebo, thus mirroring the behavioral effects. These results directly link placebo analgesia to anticipatory activity in the ventral striatum, a region involved in reward processing, and highlight the role of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, as its activity consistently scaled with increasing analgesic efficacy.

Studies were restricted to those which used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Nineteen independent studies were identified, mostly comprised of middle aged or older adults. Resting-state studies demonstrated that compared to controls, connectivity of the Default Mode Network (DMN) was reduced and the majority of task-based studies identified reduced activation in T2DM patients in regions relevant to task performance. Abnormalities of low frequency spontaneous brain activity were observed, particularly in visual regions. As most studies demonstrated that alterations in fMRI were related to poorer neuropsychological task performance, these results indicate that functional brain abnormalities in T2DM have consequences for cognition.

pmid_26083379,Neural Networks for Mindfulness and Emotion Suppression.,,"Mindfulness, an attentive non-judgmental focus on ""here and now"" experiences, has been incorporated into various cognitive behavioral therapy approaches and beneficial effects have been demonstrated. Recently, mindfulness has also been identified as a potentially effective emotion regulation strategy. On the other hand, emotion suppression, which refers to trying to avoid or escape from experiencing and being aware of one's own emotions, has been identified as a potentially maladaptive strategy. Previous studies suggest that both strategies can decrease affective responses to emotional stimuli. They would, however, be expected to provide regulation through different top-down modulation systems. The present study was aimed at elucidating the different neural systems underlying emotion regulation via mindfulness and emotion suppression approaches. Twenty-one healthy participants used the two types of strategy in response to emotional visual stimuli while functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted. Both strategies attenuated amygdala responses to emotional triggers, but the pathways to regulation differed across the two. A mindful approach appears to regulate amygdala functioning via functional connectivity from the medial prefrontal cortex, while suppression uses connectivity with other regions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Thus, the two types of emotion regulation recruit different top-down modulation processes localized at prefrontal areas. These different pathways are discussed. ",

Twenty-six IGD participants and 28 demographically matched healthy controls were recruited. After collecting Rumination-Reflection questionnaire data and high-resolution T1-weighted MRI data, participants were asked to complete a sequential decision task. The results demonstrated that compared to healthy controls, IGD participants exhibited significantly decreased GMV in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG). Moreover, GMV in the SFG of IGD participants fully mediated the impact of reflection level on the emotion of loss outcome during the sequential decision task. These results indicate that IGD is associated with reduced GMV in the SFG, and this structural change in IGD contributes to a particular relationship between the level of reflection and regret emotion for loss outcome in the sequential decision task.

To observe differences in neural activity of associative memory effects, this study compared 13 heavy marijuana users and 15 non-using controls, ranging in age from 18 to 25, during performance of a marijuana Implicit Association Test (IAT). Group by condition interactions in the putamen, caudate, and right inferior frontal gyrus were observed. Relative to non-users, marijuana users showed greater bilateral activity in the dorsal striatum (caudate and putamen) during compatible trials focused on perceived positive outcomes of use. Alternatively, relative to the marijuana-using group, the non-users showed greater activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus during incompatible trials, which require more effortful processing of information. Further, relative to fixation, heavy users showed bilateral activity in the caudate and putamen, hippocampus and some frontal regions during compatible trials and no significant activity during incompatible trials. The non-using group showed greater activity in frontal regions during incompatible trials relative to fixation and no significant activity during compatible trials. These findings are consistent with a dual process framework of appetitive behaviors proposing that (1) implicit associations underlying habit are mediated through neural circuitry dependent on the striatum, and (2) deliberative/controlled behaviors are mediated through circuitry more dependent on the prefrontal cortex.

However, established markers like cortical thickness and grey matter volume are heavily influenced by post-onset changes and thus provide limited possibility of accessing early pathologies. Gyrification on the other side is assumed to be more specifically determined by genetic and early developmental factors. Here, we compare T1 weighted 3 Tesla MRI scans of 51 schizophrenia patients and 102 healthy controls (matched for age and gender) using a unified processing pipeline with the CAT12 toolbox. Our study provides a direct comparison between 3D gyrification, cortical thickness, and grey matter volume. We demonstrate that significant (p < 0.05, FWE corrected) results only partially overlap between modalities. Gyrification is altered in bilateral insula, temporal pole and left orbitofrontal cortex, while cortical thickness is additionally reduced in the prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and occipital cortex. Grey matter volume (VBM) was reduced in bilateral medial temporal lobes including the amygdala as well as medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices and cerebellum. Our results lend further support for altered gyrification as a marker of early neurodevelopmental disturbance in schizophrenia and show its relation to other morphological markers. ",

The aim of this study was to determine possible pathophysiological trait markers of bipolar disorder in neural circuits involved in working memory. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 18 euthymic bipolar patients and 18 matched healthy volunteers using two circuit-specific experimental tasks established by prior systematic neuroimaging studies of working memory. Both euthymic bipolar patients and healthy controls showed working memory-related brain activations that were highly consistent with findings from previous comparable neuroimaging studies in healthy subjects. While these patterns of brain activation were completely preserved in the bipolar patients, only the patients exhibited activation of the right amygdala during the articulatory rehearsal task. In the same task, functional activation in right frontal and intraparietal cortex and in the right cerebellum was significantly enhanced in the patients. These findings indicate that the right amygdala is pathologically activated in euthymic bipolar patients during performance of a circuit-specific working memory task (articulatory rehearsal). This pathophysiological abnormality appears to be a trait marker in bipolar disorders that can be observed even in the euthymic state and that seems to be largely independent of task performance and medication.

pmid_11002353,Practice-related functional activation changes in a working memory task.,,"The effects of practice on the functional anatomy of a visuospatial working memory (VSWM) task were studied using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Functional imaging was conducted as subjects completed a moderate (Experiment 1) or extensive (Experiment 2) amount of practice on a delayed-match-to-sample task. While improvement in task performance was seen with practice, the task's dependence upon VSWM did not change. Activations in frontal (inferior, middle, and precentral gyri and superior frontal sulcus), parietal (intra-parietal sulcus, inferior parietal lobule, and precuneus) and cingulate (anterior and posterior) regions were observed as were bilateral insular and occipital activations. With the exception of the posterior cingulate, practice produced activation decreases in these regions, thus providing little evidence for a re-organization of the functional neuroanatomy. Fewer regions passing statistical criteria were observed at the end of practice relative to early in practice. Regions that were lost were mostly posterior (occipital and precuneus) but also included the left middle frontal gyrus, left precentral gyrus, and right insula suggesting that a more precise VSWM functional map can be observed once processes specific to encountering a novel task are removed. Little further activation changes were observed after extensive practice. These results suggest, minimally, that practice effects should be considered so as to avoid incorrectly attributing functional activation to a cognitive process of interest. Further, these data show that the dynamics of functional change can be tracked while a task is being learned and as an important cognitive process becomes more skilled. ",

fMRI","This work investigated the impact of heavy marijuana use during adolescence on emotional functioning, as well as the brain functional mediators of this effect. Participants (n=40) were recruited from the Michigan Longitudinal Study (MLS). Data on marijuana use were collected prospectively beginning in childhood as part of the MLS. Participants were classified as heavy marijuana users (n=20) or controls with minimal marijuana use. Two facets of emotional functioning-negative emotionality and resiliency (a self-regulatory mechanism)-were assessed as part of the MLS at three time points: mean age 13.4, mean age 19.6, and mean age 23.1. Functional neuroimaging data during an emotion-arousal word task were collected at mean age 20.2. Negative emotionality decreased and resiliency increased across the three time points in controls but not heavy marijuana users. Compared with controls, heavy marijuana users had less activation to negative words in temporal, prefrontal, and occipital cortices, insula, and amygdala. Activation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to negative words mediated an association between marijuana group and later negative emotionality. Activation of the cuneus/lingual gyrus mediated an association between marijuana group and later resiliency. Results support growing evidence that heavy marijuana use during adolescence affects later emotional outcomes. ",

serotonin","This functional magnetic resonance imaging study was designed to observe how physiological brain states can alter food preferences. A primary goal was to observe food-sensitive regions and moreover examine whether 5-HTP intake would activate areas which have been associated with appetite suppression, anorexia, satiety, and weight loss. Fourteen healthy male and female participants took part in the study, of which half of them received the supplement 5-HTP and the rest vitamin C (control) on an empty stomach. During the scanning session, they passively observed food (high calories, proteins, carbohydrates) and nonfood movie stimuli. Within the 5-HTP group, a comparison of food and nonfood stimuli showed significant responses that included the limbic system, the basal ganglia, and the prefrontal, temporal, and parietal cortices. For the vitamin C group, activity was mainly located in temporal and occipital regions. Compared to the vitamin C group, the 5-HTP group in response to food showed increased activation on the VMPFC, the DLPFC, limbic, and temporal regions. For the 5-HTP group, activity in response to food high in protein content compared to food high in calories and carbohydrates was located in the limbic system and the right caudomedial OFC, whereas for the vitamin C group, activity was mainly located at the inferior parietal lobes, the anterior cingulate gyri, and the left ventrolateral OFC. Greater responses to carbohydrates and high calorie stimuli in the vitamin C group were located at the right temporal gyrus, the occipital gyrus, the right VLPFC, whereas for the 5-HTP group, activity was observed at the left VMPFC, the parahippocampal gyrus bilaterally, the occipital lobe, and middle temporal gyri. In line with the hypotheses, 5-HTP triggered cortical responses associated with healthy body weight as well as cerebral preferences for protein-rich stimuli. The brain's activity is altered by macronutrients rich or deprived in the body. By reading the organisms physiological states and combining them with memory experiences, it constructs behavioral strategies steering an individual toward or in opposition to a particular food. ",
pmid_22574141,Auditory resting-state network connectivity in tinnitus: a functional MRI study.,,"The underlying functional neuroanatomy of tinnitus remains poorly understood. Few studies have focused on functional cerebral connectivity changes in tinnitus patients. The aim of this study was to test if functional MRI ""resting-state"" connectivity patterns in auditory network differ between tinnitus patients and normal controls. Thirteen chronic tinnitus subjects and fifteen age-matched healthy controls were studied on a 3 tesla MRI. Connectivity was investigated using independent component analysis and an automated component selection approach taking into account the spatial and temporal properties of each component. Connectivity in extra-auditory regions such as brainstem, basal ganglia/NAc, cerebellum, parahippocampal, right prefrontal, parietal, and sensorimotor areas was found to be increased in tinnitus subjects. The right primary auditory cortex, left prefrontal, left fusiform gyrus, and bilateral occipital regions showed a decreased connectivity in tinnitus. These results show that there is a modification of cortical and subcortical functional connectivity in tinnitus encompassing attentional, mnemonic, and emotional networks. Our data corroborate the hypothesized implication of non-auditory regions in tinnitus physiopathology and suggest that various regions of the brain seem involved in the persistent awareness of the phenomenon as well as in the development of the associated distress leading to disabling chronic tinnitus. ",
pmid_19467990,Enhanced activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus in deaf and dyslexic adults during rhyming.,,"Hearing developmental dyslexics and profoundly deaf individuals both have difficulties processing the internal structure of words (phonological processing) and learning to read. In hearing non-impaired readers, the development of phonological representations depends on audition. In hearing dyslexics, many argue, auditory processes may be impaired. In congenitally profoundly deaf individuals, auditory speech processing is essentially absent. Two separate literatures have previously reported enhanced activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus in both deaf and dyslexic adults when contrasted with hearing non-dyslexics during reading or phonological tasks. Here, we used a rhyme judgement task to compare adults from these two special populations to a hearing non-dyslexic control group. All groups were matched on non-verbal intelligence quotient, reading age and rhyme performance. Picture stimuli were used since this requires participants to generate their own phonological representations, rather than have them partially provided via text. By testing well-matched groups of participants on the same task, we aimed to establish whether previous literatures reporting differences between individuals with and without phonological processing difficulties have identified the same regions of differential activation in these two distinct populations. The data indicate greater activation in the deaf and dyslexic groups than in the hearing non-dyslexic group across a large portion of the left inferior frontal gyrus. This includes the pars triangularis, extending superiorly into the middle frontal gyrus and posteriorly to include the pars opercularis, and the junction with the ventral precentral gyrus. Within the left inferior frontal gyrus, there was variability between the two groups with phonological processing difficulties. The superior posterior tip of the left pars opercularis, extending into the precentral gyrus, was activated to a greater extent by deaf than dyslexic participants, whereas the superior posterior portion of the pars triangularis extending into the ventral pars opercularis, was activated to a greater extent by dyslexic than deaf participants. Whether these regions play differing roles in compensating for poor phonological processing is not clear. However, we argue that our main finding of greater inferior frontal gyrus activation in both groups with phonological processing difficulties in contrast to controls suggests greater reliance on the articulatory component of speech during phonological processing when auditory processes are absent (deaf group) or impaired (dyslexic group). Thus, the brain appears to develop a similar solution to a processing problem that has different antecedents in these two populations. ",
pmid_11571223,Prefrontal regions involved in keeping information in and out of mind.,,"Goal-directed behaviour depends on keeping relevant information in mind (working memory) and irrelevant information out of mind (behavioural inhibition or interference resolution). Prefrontal cortex is essential for working memory and for interference resolution, but it is unknown whether these two mental abilities are mediated by common or distinct prefrontal regions. To address this question, functional MRI was used to identify brain regions activated by separate manipulations of working memory load and interference within a single task (the Sternberg item recognition paradigm). Both load and interference manipulations were associated with performance decrements. Subjects were unaware of the interference manipulation. There was a high degree of overlap between the regions activated by load and interference, which included bilateral ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, anterior cingulate and parietal cortex. Critically, no region was activated exclusively by interference. Several regions within this common network exhibited a brain-behaviour correlation across subjects for the load or interference manipulation. Activation within the right middle frontal gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus was correlated with the ability to resolve interference efficiently, but not the ability to manage an increased working memory load efficiently. Conversely, activation of the anterior cingulate was correlated with load susceptibility, but was not correlated with interference susceptibility. These findings suggest that, within the circuitry engaged by this task, some regions are more critically involved in the resolution of interference whereas others are more involved in the resolution of an increase in load. The anterior cingulate was engaged to a greater extent by the load than interference manipulation, suggesting that this region, which is thought to be involved in detecting the need for greater allocation of attentional resources, may be particularly implicated during awareness of the need for cognitive control. In the present study, interference resolution did not involve recruitment of additional inhibitory circuitry, but was instead mediated by a subset of the neural system supporting working memory. ",
pmid_16427320,Improvement-related functional plasticity following pitch memory training.,,"Functional activation patterns of an auditory working memory task were examined prior to and after 5 days of training (1 h/day). A control group with no training was scanned twice at the same intervals to assess test-retest effects. Based on behavioral improvement scores, the training group (n = 14) was divided into ""Strong-Learners (SL)"" and ""Weak-Learners (WL)"". No significant functional or structural brain differences were seen between the SL and WL groups prior to training. Imaging contrasts comparing post- with pre-training sessions showed a significant signal increase in the left Heschl's gyrus (HG) as well as in the left posterior superior temporal and supramarginal gyrus for the SL group, while the WL group showed significant signal increases in the left HG and anterior insular cortex as well as in a lingual-orbitofrontal-parahippocampal network. The test-retest analysis in the control group revealed only minimal signal increases in a right dorsolateral prefrontal region. A random effects analysis comparing the SL group with the WL group using the post- and pre-training contrast images showed increased activation only in the left supramarginal gyrus but not in HG. The importance of HG in pitch discrimination has been established in previous studies. The pitch memory component differentiated our task from a straight pitch discrimination task. It is most likely that the activation of the SMG reflects its importance in the short-term storage of auditory material, and it was this activation that best differentiated between subjects' levels of performance. ",
pmid_14699419,Increased prefrontal and parietal activity after training of working memory.,,"Working memory capacity has traditionally been thought to be constant. Recent studies, however, suggest that working memory can be improved by training. In this study, we have investigated the changes in brain activity that are induced by working memory training. Two experiments were carried out in which healthy, adult human subjects practiced working memory tasks for 5 weeks. Brain activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before, during and after training. After training, brain activity that was related to working memory increased in the middle frontal gyrus and superior and inferior parietal cortices. The changes in cortical activity could be evidence of training-induced plasticity in the neural systems that underlie working memory. ",
pmid_21782246,"Abnormal neural activities in first-episode, treatment-naïve, short-illness-duration, and treatment-response patients with major depressive disorder: a resting-state fMRI study.",,"Abnormality of limbic-cortical networks was postulated in depression. Using a regional homogeneity (ReHo) approach, we explored the regional homogeneity (ReHo) of the brain regions in patients with first-episode, treatment-naïve, short-illness-duration, and treatment-response depression in resting state to test the abnormality hypothesis of limbic-cortical networks in major depressive disorder (MDD). Seventeen patients with treatment-response MDD and 17 gender-, age-, and education-matched healthy subjects participated in the resting-state fMRI scans. Our findings suggested the abnormality of limbic-cortical networks in first-episode, treatment-naïve, short-illness-duration, and treatment-response MDD patients, and added an expanding literature to the abnormality hypothesis of limbic-cortical networks in MDD.

pmid_25928206,Acupuncture attenuates cognitive deficits and increases pyramidal neuron number in hippocampal CA1 area of vascular dementia rats.,,"Decreased cognition is recognized as one of the most severe and consistent behavioral impairments in dementia. Experimental studies have reported that acupuncture may improve cognitive deficits, relieve vascular dementia (VD) symptoms, and increase cerebral perfusion and electrical activity. Multi-infarction dementia was modeled in rats with 3% microemboli saline suspension. Two weeks after acupuncture at Zusanli (ST36), all rats were subjected to a hidden platform trial to test their 3-day spatial memory using the Morris water maze test. To estimate the numbers of pyramidal neuron, astrocytes, and synaptic boutons in hippocampal CA1 area, we adopted an unbiased stereology method to accurately sample and measure the size of cells. We found that acupuncture at ST36 significantly decreased the escape latency of VD rats. In addition, acupuncture significantly increased the pyramidal neuron number in hippocampal CA1 area (P < 0.05) and tended to decrease the number of astrocytes (P = 0.063). However, there was no significant change in the synaptic bouton number of hippocampal CA1 area in any of the groups (P > 0.05). These findings suggest that acupuncture may improve cognitive deficits and increase pyramidal neuron number of hippocampal CA1 area in VD rats. ",
pmid_19854028,Amplitude of low-frequency oscillations in schizophrenia: a resting state fMRI study.,,"Recently, a great deal of interest has arisen in resting state fMRI as a measure of tonic brain function in clinical populations. Most studies have focused on the examination of temporal correlation between resting state fMRI low-frequency oscillations (LFOs). Studies on the amplitudes of these low-frequency oscillations are rarely reported. Here, we used amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF; the relative amplitude that resides in the low frequencies) to examine the amplitude of LFO in schizophrenia. Twenty-six healthy controls and 29 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder participated. Our findings show that patients showed reduced low-frequency amplitude in proportion to the total frequency band investigated (i.e., fALFF) in the lingual gyrus, left cuneus, left insula/superior temporal gyrus, and right caudate and increased fALFF in the medial prefrontal cortex and the right parahippocampal gyrus. ALFF was reduced in patients in the lingual gyrus, cuneus, and precuneus and increased in the left parahippocampal gyrus. These results suggest LFO abnormalities in schizophrenia. The implication of these abnormalities for schizophrenic symptomatology is further discussed. ",
pmid_16912129,Impact of combined estradiol and norethindrone therapy on visuospatial working memory assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging.,,"Hormones regulate neuronal function in brain regions critical to cognition; however, the cognitive effects of postmenopausal hormone therapy are controversial. The goal was to evaluate the effect of postmenopausal hormone therapy on neural circuitry involved in spatial working memory. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study was performed. The study was performed in a tertiary care university medical center. Ten healthy postmenopausal women of average age 56.9 yr were recruited. Volunteers were randomized to the order they received hormone therapy (5 microg ethinyl estradiol and 1 mg norethindrone acetate). Subjects received hormone therapy or placebo for 4 wk, followed by a 1-month washout period with no medications, and then received the other treatment for 4 wk. At the end of each 4-wk treatment period, a functional magnetic resonance imaging study was performed using a nonverbal (spatial) working memory task, the Visual Delayed Matching to Sample task. The effects of hormone therapy on brain activation patterns were compared with placebo. Compared with the placebo condition, hormone therapy was associated with a more pronounced activation in the prefrontal cortex (BA 44 and 45), bilaterally (P < 0.001). Hormone therapy was associated with more effective activation of a brain region critical in primary visual working memory tasks. The data suggest a functional plasticity of memory systems in older women that can be altered by hormones. ",

somatosensory stimulation","Acupuncture can be regarded as a complex somatosensory stimulation. Here, we evaluate whether the point locations chosen for a somatosensory stimulation with acupuncture needles differently change the brain activity in healthy volunteers. We used EEG, event-related fMRI, and resting-state functional connectivity fMRI to assess neural responses to standardized needle stimulation of the acupuncture point ST36 (lower leg) and two control point locations (CP1 same dermatome, CP2 different dermatome). Cerebral responses were expected to differ for stimulation in two different dermatomes (CP2 different from ST36 and CP1), or stimulation at the acupuncture point vs. the control points. For EEG, mu rhythm power increased for ST36 compared to CP1 or CP2, but not when comparing the two control points. The fMRI analysis found more pronounced insula and S2 (secondary somatosensory cortex) activation, as well as precuneus deactivation during ST36 stimulation. The S2 seed-based functional connectivity analysis revealed increased connectivity to right precuneus for both comparisons, ST36 vs. CP1 and ST36 vs. CP2, however in different regions. Our results suggest that stimulation at acupuncture points may modulate somatosensory and saliency processing regions more readily than stimulation at non-acupuncture point locations. Also, our findings suggest potential modulation of pain perception due to acupuncture stimulation. ",
pmid_22565029,Frontal and parietal activity after sleep deprivation is dependent on task difficulty and can be predicted by the fMRI response after normal sleep.,,"Sleep disturbance in neurological and psychiatric disorders is common and associated with diminished cognitive functioning. Whilst these deficits can be localised predominantly to frontal and parietal regions, there have been reported inconsistencies which may be due to differences in the difficulty and type of task. In the present study we examined the effects of sleep deprivation (SD) whilst parametrically varying working memory load using an n-back task. 20 right-handed males performed the n-back task after a night of normal sleep (RW: rested wakefulness) and after approximately 31 h of SD. Comparison of load responsive cerebral activation identified two clusters where the parametric response was altered after SD. In the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activity was reduced at the most difficult working memory load, whereas in the right inferior parietal lobe activity was increased at the simplest working memory load. The strength of activation in both of these regions during RW predicted the response of those same regions to SD. While the ability to predict signal change has previously been demonstrated using behavioural measures, to our knowledge this is the first study to show that the neuronal effects of SD can be predicted based upon activation during a normal rested condition.

pmid_22894176,A PET-CT study on the specificity of acupoints through acupuncture treatment in migraine patients.,,"In the field of acupuncture research, the topic of acupoint specificity has received increasing attention, but no unified conclusion has been reached on whether or not acupoint specificity exists. Furthermore, the majority of previous acupuncture neuroimaging studies have been performed using healthy subjects. In this study, patients with migraine were used to investigate acupoint specificity. Thirty patients with migraine were enrolled and randomized into three groups: Traditional Acupuncture Group (TAG), Control Acupuncture Group (CAG), and Migraine Group (MG). The TAG was treated by acupuncture stimulation at Waiguan (TE5), Yang Lingquan (GB34), and Fengchi (GB20). The CAG was treated at Touwei (ST8), Pianli (LI6), and Zusanli (ST36). The MG received no treatment. Positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET-CT) was used to test for differences in brain activation between the TAG and CAG versus MG, respectively. Traditional acupuncture treatment was more effective for pain reduction than control acupuncture treatment. The TAG showed higher brain metabolism than the MG in the middle temporal cortex (MTC), orbital frontal cortex (OFC), insula, middle frontal gyrus, angular gyrus, post-cingulate cortex (PCC), the precuneus, and the middle cingulate cortex (MCC). Metabolism decreased in the parahippocampus, hippocampus, fusiform gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and cerebellum in the TAG compared with the MG. In the CAG, metabolism increased compared with the MG in the MTC, supratemporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and MCC, whereas metabolism decreased in the cerebellum. Acupuncture stimulation of different points on similar body regions in migraine patients reduced pain and induced different levels of cerebral glucose metabolism in pain-related brain regions. These findings may support the functional specificity of migraine- treatment-related acupoint. The number of our clinical trial registration is: ChiCTR-TRC-11001813, and the protocol and inclusion criteria have already been registered as ChiCTR-TRC-11001813. ",
pmid_21782031,Mind wandering and attention during focused meditation: a fine-grained temporal analysis of fluctuating cognitive states.,,"Studies have suggested that the default mode network is active during mind wandering, which is often experienced intermittently during sustained attention tasks. Conversely, an anticorrelated task-positive network is thought to subserve various forms of attentional processing. Understanding how these two systems work together is central for understanding many forms of optimal and sub-optimal task performance. Here we present a basic model of naturalistic cognitive fluctuations between mind wandering and attentional states derived from the practice of focused attention meditation. This model proposes four intervals in a cognitive cycle: mind wandering, awareness of mind wandering, shifting of attention, and sustained attention. People who train in this style of meditation cultivate their abilities to monitor cognitive processes related to attention and distraction, making them well suited to report on these mental events. Fourteen meditation practitioners performed breath-focused meditation while undergoing fMRI scanning. When participants realized their mind had wandered, they pressed a button and returned their focus to the breath. The four intervals above were then constructed around these button presses. We hypothesized that periods of mind wandering would be associated with default mode activity, whereas cognitive processes engaged during awareness of mind wandering, shifting of attention and sustained attention would engage attentional subnetworks. Analyses revealed activity in brain regions associated with the default mode during mind wandering, and in salience network regions during awareness of mind wandering. Elements of the executive network were active during shifting and sustained attention. Furthermore, activations during these cognitive phases were modulated by lifetime meditation experience. These findings support and extend theories about cognitive correlates of distributed brain networks. ",
pmid_12742674,Differential patterns of striatal activation in young children with and without ADHD.,,"Cognitive control, defined as the ability to suppress inappropriate thoughts and actions, is compromised in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This study examines the neural basis of this deficit. We used a paradigm that incorporates a parametric manipulation within a go/nogo task, so that the number of go trials preceding a nogo trial is varied to tax the neural systems underlying cognitive control with increasing levels of interference. Using this paradigm in combination with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we show that children without ADHD have increased susceptibility to interference with increasing numbers of go trials preceding a nogo trial, but children with ADHD have difficulty even with a single go trial preceding a nogo trial. In addition, children with ADHD do not activate frontostriatal regions in the same manner as normally developing children, but rather rely on a more diffuse network of regions, including more posterior and dorsolateral prefrontal regions. Normal immature cognition may be characterized as being susceptible to interference and supported by the maturation of frontostriatal circuitry. ADHD children show a slightly different cognitive profile at 6 to 10 years of age that is paralleled by a relative lack of or delay in the maturation of ventral frontostriatal circuitry. ",
pmid_18423575,Neurophysiological responses to traumatic reminders in the acute aftermath of serious motor vehicle collisions using [15O]-H2O positron emission tomography.,,"Neuroimaging studies report that individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder show abnormal responses in the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)/anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during exposure to traumatic reminders. However, neural responses arising in the early aftermath of a traumatic event have not been studied. Twenty-two motor vehicle collision survivors and 12 nontraumatized control subjects participated. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured using [(15)O]-H(2)O positron emission tomography (PET) at rest and as subjects listened to scripts of traumatic and neutral events. Self-report measures rated emotional responses to the scripts; standardized assessments (Impact of Events--Revised) evaluated acute stress symptoms at scanning and at 3-month follow-up. Most subjects improved symptomatically. At rest, trauma subjects showed hyperperfusion in right mPFC/ACC and hypoperfusion in right amygdala compared with control subjects. In trauma subjects, listening to trauma scripts versus neutral scripts resulted in decreased flow in the right amygdala and left amygdala/perirhinal cortex, and symptom scores correlated negatively with right hippocampal flow changes. Symptom improvement at 3 months correlated negatively with rCBF changes in right perirhinal cortex and hippocampus during the trauma versus neutral script contrast. Subjective disturbance during the trauma versus neutral contrast correlated positively with rCBF changes in right amygdala and left mPFC. Functional connectivity analyses of rCBF changes during trauma versus neutral scripts demonstrated left amygdala coupling with right ACC and bilateral anterior insula, as well as coupling between the amygdala and contralateral hippocampus. In recently traumatized subjects functional interactions between the amygdala, perirhinal cortex and ACC/mPFC that occur during exposure to traumatic reminders may underlie adaptive/recuperative processes.

pmid_19285143,Visual features of an observed agent do not modulate human brain activity during action observation.,,"Recent neuroimaging evidence in macaques has shown that the neural system underlying the observation of hand actions performed by others (i.e., ""action observation system"") is modulated by whether the observed action is performed by a person in full view or an isolated hand (i.e., type of view manipulation). Although a human homologue of such circuit has been identified, whether in humans the neural processes involved in this capacity are modulated by the type of view remains unknown. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate whether the ""action observation system"", with specific reference to the ventral premotor cortex, responds differentially depending on type of view. We also tested this manipulation within regions of the human brain showing overlapping activity for both the observation and the execution of action (""mirror"" regions). To this end, the same subjects were requested to observe grasping actions performed under the two types of view (observation conditions) or to perform a grasping action (execution condition). Results from whole-brain analyses indicate that overlapping activity for action observation and execution was evident in a broad network of areas including parietal, premotor and temporal cortices. Activity within such network was evident for both the observation of a person in full view or an isolated hand, but it was not modulated by the type of view. Similarly, results from region of interest (ROI) analyses, performed within the ventral premotor cortex, did confirm that this area responded in a similar fashion following the observation of either an isolated hand or an entire model acting. These findings offer novel insights on what the ""action observation"" and the ""mirror"" systems visually code and how the processing underlying such coding may vary across species. Further, they support the hypothesis that action goal is amongst the main determinants for the revelation of action observation activity, and to the existence of a broad system involved in the simulation of action.

theory of mind","The Default Mode Network (DMN) has been found to be involved in various domains of cognitive and social processing. The present article will review brain connectivity results related to the DMN in the fields of social understanding of others: emotion perception, empathy, theory of mind, and morality. Most of the reviewed studies focused on healthy subjects with no neurological and psychiatric disease, but some studies on patients with autism and psychopathy will also be discussed. Common results show that the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) plays a key role in the social understanding of others, and the subregions of the MPFC contribute differently to this function according to their roles in different subsystems of the DMN. At the bottom, the ventral MPFC in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) subsystem and its connections with emotion regions are mainly associated with emotion engagement during social interactions. Above, the anterior MPFC (aMPFC) in the cortical midline structures (CMS) and its connections with posterior and anterior cingulate cortex contribute mostly to making self-other distinctions. At the top, the dorsal MPFC (dMPFC) in the dMPFC subsystem and its connection with the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) are primarily related to the understanding of other's mental states. As behaviors become more complex, the related regions in frontal cortex are located higher. This reflects the transfer of information processing from automatic to cognitive processes with the increase of the complexity of social interaction. Besides the MPFC and TPJ, the connectivities of posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) also show some changes during tasks from the four social fields. These results indicate that the DMN is indispensable in the social understanding of others. ",
pmid_31694045,Meta-analysis of cortical thickness abnormalities in medication-free patients with major depressive disorder.,,"Alterations in cortical thickness have been identified in major depressive disorder (MDD), but findings have been variable and inconsistent. To date, no reliable tools have been available for the meta-analysis of surface-based morphometric (SBM) studies to effectively characterize what has been learned in previous studies, and drug treatments may have differentially impacted findings. We conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies that explored cortical thickness in medication-free patients with MDD, using a newly developed meta-analytic mask compatible with seed-based d mapping (SDM) meta-analytic software. We performed the meta-regression to explore the effects of demographics and clinical characteristics on variation in cortical thickness in MDD. Fifteen studies describing 529 patients and 586 healthy controls (HCs) were included. Medication-free patients with MDD, relative to HCs, showed a complex pattern of increased cortical thickness in some areas (posterior cingulate cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex) and decreased cortical thickness in others (gyrus rectus, orbital segment of the superior frontal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus). Most findings in the whole sample analysis were confirmed in a meta-analysis of studies recruiting medication-naive patients. Using the new mask specifically developed for SBM studies, this SDM meta-analysis provides evidence for regional cortical thickness alterations in MDD, mainly involving increased cortical thickness in the default mode network and decreased cortical thickness in the orbitofrontal and temporal cortex.

pmid_27115120,Subgenual cingulate cortical activity predicts the efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy.,,"Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the most effective treatment for depression, yet its mechanism of action is unknown. Our goal was to investigate the neurobiological underpinnings of ECT response using longitudinally collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in 16 patients with treatment-resistant depression and 10 healthy controls. Patients received bifrontal ECT 3 times a week under general anesthesia. We acquired rs-fMRI at three time points: at baseline, after the 1st ECT administration and after the course of the ECT treatment; depression was assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). The primary measure derived from rs-fMRI was fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (fALFF), which provides an unbiased voxel-wise estimation of brain activity. We also conducted seed-based functional connectivity analysis based on our primary findings. We compared treatment-related changes in HAM-D scores with pre- and post-treatment fALFF and connectivity measures. Subcallosal cingulate cortex (SCC) demonstrated higher BOLD signal fluctuations (fALFF) at baseline in depressed patients, and SCC fALFF decreased over the course of treatment. The baseline level of fALFF of SCC predicted response to ECT. In addition, connectivity of SCC with bilateral hippocampus, bilateral temporal pole, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex was significantly reduced over the course of treatment. These results suggest that the antidepressant effect of ECT may be mediated by downregulation of SCC activity and connectivity. SCC function may serve as an important biomarker of target engagement in the development of novel therapies for depression that is resistant to treatment with standard medications. ",

Although both groups performed the tasks equally well, children with autism showed no mirror neuron activity in the inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis). Notably, activity in this area was inversely related to symptom severity in the social domain, suggesting that a dysfunctional 'mirror neuron system' may underlie the social deficits observed in autism.

social situations","Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a symptom of borderline personality disorder (BPD). However, NSSI often occurs independently of BPD. Altered neural processing of social exclusion has been shown in adolescents with NSSI and adults with BPD with additional alterations during social inclusion in BPD patients. Aims of this study were to investigate differences in neural processing of social inclusion and exclusion situations between adolescents with NSSI and young adults with BPD and NSSI. Using fMRI, neural processing of positive and negative social situations (paradigm: ""Cyberball"") was explored. Participants were 14 adolescents with NSSI, but without BPD (M Behavioral results showed enhanced feelings of social exclusion in both patient groups as compared to healthy controls but only the NSSI group showed enhanced activation during social exclusion versus inclusion compared to the other groups. While both NSSI and BPD groups showed enhanced activation in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex during social exclusion as compared to their age-matched controls, enhanced activation during social inclusion as compared to a passive watching condition was mainly observed in the BPD group in the dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and the anterior insula. While neural processing of social exclusion was pronounced in adolescents with NSSI, BPD patients also showed increased activity in a  ",
pmid_20392942,Emotional processing in a salient motion context: integration of motion and emotion in both V5/hMT+ and the amygdala.,,"Recent studies have suggested that the extent to which primary task demands draw on attentional resources determines whether or not task-irrelevant emotional stimuli are processed. Another important factor that can bias task-relevant and task-irrelevant stimulus competition is the bottom-up factor of stimulus salience. Here, we investigated the effect of stimulus salience associated with a primary motion task on the processing of emotional face distractors. Faces of different emotional valences were presented within a context of randomly moving dots. Subjects had to detect short intervals of coherent motion while ignoring the background faces. Task salience was manipulated by the level of motion coherence of the dots with high motion coherence being associated with high salience. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show that emotional faces, compared with neutral faces, more strongly interfered with the primary task, as reflected in significant signal decreases in task-related motion area V5/hMT+. In addition, these faces elicited significant signal increases in the left amygdala. Most importantly, task salience was found to further increase amygdala's activity when presented together with an emotional face. Our data support a more general role of the amygdala as a behavioral relevance detector, which flexibly integrates behavioral relevant, salient context information to decode the emotional content of a visual scene.

pmid_21703498,Different neural patterns are associated with trials preceding inhibitory errors in children with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.,,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with difficulty inhibiting impulsive, hyperactive, and off-task behavior. However, no studies have examined whether a distinct pattern of brain activity precedes inhibitory errors in typically developing (TD) children and children with ADHD. In healthy adults, increased activity in the default mode network, a set of brain regions more active during resting or internally focused states, predicts commission errors, suggesting that momentary lapses of attention are related to inhibitory failures. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging and a go/no-go paradigm were used to explore brain activity preceding errors in 13 children with ADHD and 17 TD controls. Comparing pre-error with pre-correct trials, TD children showed activation in the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex and parahippocampal and middle frontal gyri. In contrast, children with ADHD demonstrated activation in the cerebellum, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and basal ganglia. Between-group comparison for the pre-error versus pre-correct contrast showed that children with ADHD showed greater activity in the cerebellum, DLPFC, and ventrolateral PFC compared with TD controls. Results of region-of-interest analysis confirmed that the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex are more active in TD children compared with children with ADHD. These preliminary data suggest that brain activation patterns immediately preceding errors differ between children with ADHD and TD children. In TD children, momentary lapses of attention precede errors, whereas pre-error activity in children with ADHD may be mediated by different circuits, such as those involved in response selection and control.

pmid_25275317,Tracking functional brain changes in patients with depression under psychodynamic psychotherapy using individualized stimuli.,,"Neurobiological models of depression posit limbic hyperactivity that should normalize after successful treatment. For psychotherapy, though, brain changes in patients with depression show substantial variability. Two critical issues in relevant studies concern the use of unspecific stimulation experiments and relatively short treatment protocols. Therefore changes in brain reactions to individualized stimuli were studied in patients with depression after eight months of psychodynamic psychotherapy. 18 unmedicated patients with recurrent major depressive disorder were confronted with individualized and clinically derived content in a functional MRI experiment before (T1) and after eight months (T2) of psychodynamic therapy. A control group of 17 healthy subjects was also tested twice without intervention. The experimental stimuli were sentences describing each participant's dysfunctional interpersonal relationship patterns derived from clinical interviews based on Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnostics (OPD). At T1 patients showed enhanced activation compared to controls in several limbic and subcortical regions, including amygdala and basal ganglia, when confronted with OPD sentences. At T2 the differences in brain activity between patients and controls were no longer apparent. Concurrently, patients had improved significantly in depression scores. Using ecologically valid stimuli, this study supports the model of limbic hyperactivity in depression that normalizes after treatment. Without a control group of untreated patients measured twice, though, changes in patients' brain activity could also be attributed to other factors than psychodynamic therapy. ",
pmid_19304843,What motivates repayment? Neural correlates of reciprocity in the Trust Game.,,"Reciprocity of trust is important for social interaction and depends on individual differences in social value orientation (SVO). Here, we examined the neural correlates of reciprocity by manipulating two factors that influence reciprocal behavior: (1) the risk that the trustor took when trusting and (2) the benefit for the trustee when being trusted. FMRI results showed that anterior Medial Prefrontal Frontal Cortex (aMPFC) was more active when participants defected relative to when participants reciprocated, but was not sensitive to manipulations of risk and benefit or individual differences in SVO. However, activation in the temporal-parietal-junction (rTPJ), bilateral anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was modulated by individual differences in SVO. In addition, these regions were differentially sensitive to manipulations of risk for the trustor when reciprocating. In contrast, the ACC and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were sensitive to the benefit for the trustee when reciprocating. Together, the results of this study provide more insight in how several brain regions work together when individuals reciprocate trust, by showing how these regions are differentially sensitive to reciprocity motives and perspective-taking.

At the same time the Internet has had negative ramifications. Some people are becoming preoccupied with the Internet, are unable to control their use, and are jeopardizing employment and relationships. The concept of ""Internet addiction"" has been proposed as an explanation for uncontrollable, damaging use of this technology. Symptoms of excessive Internet use are compared to the criteria used to diagnose other addictions. In particular, pathological gambling is compared to problematic Internet use because of overlapping criteria. This article suggests some modifications to the diagnostic criteria that has been commonly proposed for Internet addiction. ",
pmid_23144970,Abnormal anatomical connectivity between the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex in conduct disorder.,,"Previous research suggested that structural and functional abnormalities within the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex contribute to the pathophysiology of Conduct Disorder (CD). Here, we investigated whether the integrity of the white-matter pathways connecting these regions is abnormal and thus may represent a putative neurobiological marker for CD. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) was used to investigate white-matter microstructural integrity in male adolescents with childhood-onset CD, compared with healthy controls matched in age, sex, intelligence, and socioeconomic status. Two approaches were employed to analyze DTI data: voxel-based morphometry of fractional anisotropy (FA), an index of white-matter integrity, and virtual dissection of white-matter pathways using tractography. Adolescents with CD displayed higher FA within the right external capsule relative to controls (T = 6.08, P<0.05, Family-Wise Error, whole-brain correction). Tractography analyses showed that FA values within the uncinate fascicle (connecting the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex) were abnormally increased in individuals with CD relative to controls. This was in contrast with the inferior frontal-occipital fascicle, which showed no significant group differences in FA. The finding of increased FA in the uncinate fascicle remained significant when factoring out the contribution of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms. There were no group differences in the number of streamlines in either of these anatomical tracts. These results provide evidence that CD is associated with white-matter microstructural abnormalities in the anatomical tract that connects the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex, the uncinate fascicle. These results implicate abnormal maturation of white-matter pathways which are fundamental in the regulation of emotional behavior in CD. ",
pmid_29912880,Investigating the association of ventral and dorsal striatal dysfunction during reward anticipation with negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and healthy individuals.,,"Negative symptoms are a core feature of schizophrenia and also found in healthy individuals in subclinical forms. According to the current literature the two negative symptom domains, apathy and diminished expression may have different underlying neural mechanisms. Previous observations suggest that striatal dysfunction is associated with apathy in schizophrenia. However, it is unclear whether apathy is specifically related to ventral or dorsal striatal alterations. Here, we investigated striatal dysfunction during reward anticipation in patients with schizophrenia and a non-clinical population, to determine whether it is associated with apathy. Chronic schizophrenia patients (n = 16) and healthy controls (n = 23) underwent an event- related functional MRI, while performing a variant of the Monetary Incentive Delay Task. The two negative symptom domains were assessed in both groups using the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale. In schizophrenia patients, we saw a strong negative correlation between apathy and ventral and dorsal striatal activation during reward anticipation. In contrast, there was no correlation with diminished expression. In healthy controls, apathy was not correlated with ventral or dorsal striatal activation during reward anticipation. This study replicates our previous findings of a correlation between ventral striatal activity and apathy but not diminished expression in chronic schizophrenia patients. The association between apathy and reduced dorsal striatal activity during reward anticipation suggests that impaired action-outcome selection is involved in the pathophysiology of motivational deficits in schizophrenia.

pmid_25304525,A meta-analysis of brain mechanisms of placebo analgesia: consistent findings and unanswered questions.,,"Placebo treatments reliably reduce pain in the clinic and in the lab. Because pain is a subjective experience, it has been difficult to determine whether placebo analgesia is clinically relevant. Neuroimaging studies of placebo analgesia provide objective evidence of placebo-induced changes in brain processing and allow researchers to isolate the mechanisms underlying placebo-based pain reduction. We conducted formal meta-analyses of 25 neuroimaging studies of placebo analgesia and expectancy-based pain modulation. Results revealed that placebo effects and expectations for reduced pain elicit reliable reductions in activation during noxious stimulation in regions often associated with pain processing, including the dorsal anterior cingulate, thalamus, and insula. In addition, we observed consistent reductions during painful stimulation in the amygdala and striatum, regions implicated widely in studies of affect and valuation. This suggests that placebo effects are strongest on brain regions traditionally associated with not only pain, but also emotion and value more generally. Other brain regions showed reliable increases in activation with expectations for reduced pain. These included the prefrontal cortex (including dorsolateral, ventromedial, and orbitofrontal cortices), the midbrain surrounding the periaqueductal gray, and the rostral anterior cingulate. We discuss implications of these findings as well as how future studies can expand our understanding of the precise functional contributions of the brain systems identified here. ",

This study sought to identify brain responses to visual food cues and explore its relationships with adiposity and sex in pre-pubertal children. Brain responses to palatable food vs. non-food cues were measured in 53 children (age: 8.18 ± .66 years; sex: 22 boys, 31 girls) after an overnight fast. Whole-brain analysis (cluster-correction Z > 2.3, P < .05) was performed to examine brain food cue reactivity and its relationships with adiposity and sex. Greater brain activity in response to food vs. non-food cues was observed in regions implicated in reward (orbital frontal cortex, striatum), taste (insula, postcentral gyrus), appetite (hypothalamus), emotion (amygdala), memory (hippocampus), visual processing (occipital cortex) and attention (parietal cortex). A negative association was found between percent body fat and food cue reactivity in the medial prefrontal cortex and lateral orbital frontal cortex adjusting for age and sex. Boys compared with girls had increased food cue reactivity in right hippocampus and visual cortex. These data suggest that body fat and sex are important moderators of brain food cue reactivity in children. ",
pmid_23452665,Brain effects of cognitive remediation therapy in schizophrenia: a structural and functional neuroimaging study.,,"Cognitive remediation therapy positively affects cognition and daily functioning in patients with schizophrenia. However, studies on the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of this treatment are scarce. The aim of the current study was to investigate functional and structural connectivity brain changes in schizophrenia patients after cognitive remediation therapy using a whole-brain approach that combined functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. A randomized controlled trial with 30 schizophrenia outpatients and 15 healthy volunteers. A strategy-learning-based treatment was used as a cognitive remediation therapy. A social skills training that provides useful information about illness management was used as an active control. We investigated changes in the pattern of functional connectivity assessed during an n-back task by tensorial independent component analysis as implemented in the multivariate exploratory linear decomposition into independent components and in the fractional anisotropy index of white matter integrity using tract-based spatial statistics. Brain networks activation pattern significantly changed in patients exposed to the cognitive treatment in the sense of normalizing toward the patterns observed in healthy control subjects. Additionally, in white matter, they showed an increase in fractional anisotropy index in the anterior part of the genu of the corpus callosum. Cognitive improvement, functional, and also structural changes showed statistically significant correlations. Improvement in brain functioning detected after cognitive remediation therapy in schizophrenia patients might be based on an increase of the interhemispheric information transfer between the bilateral prefrontal cortexes via the corpus callosum.

pmid_14584558,Evidence for quantitative domain dominance for verbal and spatial working memory in frontal and parietal cortex.,,"Neuroimaging studies in humans have shown that different working memory (WM) tasks recruit a common bilateral fronto-parietal cortical network. Animal studies as well as neuroimaging studies in humans have suggested that this network, in particular the prefrontal cortex, is preferentially recruited when material from different domains (e.g. spatial information or verbal/object information) has to be memorized. Early imaging studies have suggested qualitative dissociations in the prefrontal cortex for spatial and object/verbal WM, either in a left-right or a ventral-dorsal dimension. However, results from different studies are inconsistent. Moreover, recent fMRI studies have failed to find evidence for domain dependent dissociations of WM-related activity in prefrontal cortex. Here we present evidence from two independent fMRI studies using physically identical stimuli in a verbal and spatial WM task showing that domain dominance for WM does indeed exist, although only in the form of quantitative differences in activation and not in the form of a dissociation with different prefrontal regions showing mutually exclusive activation in different domains. Our results support a mixed dimension model of domain dominance for WM within the prefrontal cortex, with left ventral prefrontal cortex (PFC) supporting preferentially verbal WM and right dorsal PFC supporting preferentially spatial WM. The concept of domain dominance is discussed in the light of recent theories of prefrontal cortex function. ",
pmid_22776461,Nucleus accumbens response to food cues predicts subsequent snack consumption in women and increased body mass index in those with reduced self-control.,,"Individuals have difficulty controlling their food consumption, which is due in part to the ubiquity of tempting food cues in the environment. Individual differences in the propensity to attribute incentive (motivational) salience to and act on these cues may explain why some individuals eat more than others. Using fMRI in healthy women, we found that food cue related activity in the nucleus accumbens, a key brain region for food motivation and reward, was related to subsequent snack food consumption. However, both nucleus accumbens activation and snack food consumption were unrelated to self-reported hunger, or explicit wanting and liking for the snack. In contrast, food cue reactivity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex was associated with subjective hunger/appetite, but not with consumption. Whilst the food cue reactivity in the nucleus accumbens that predicted snack consumption was not directly related to body mass index (BMI), it was associated with increased BMI in individuals reporting low self-control. Our findings reveal a neural substrate underpinning automatic environmental influences on consumption in humans and demonstrate how self-control interacts with this response to predict BMI. Our data provide support for theoretical models that advocate a 'dual hit' of increased incentive salience attribution to food cues and poor self-control in determining vulnerability to overeating and overweight.

Mental imitation
Mirror neuron system","Mental imitation, perhaps a precursor to motor imitation, involves visual perspective-taking and motor imagery. Research on mental imitation in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has been rather limited compared to that on motor imitation. The main objective of this fMRI study is to determine the differences in brain responses underlying mirroring and mentalizing networks during mental imitation in children and adolescents with ASD. Thirteen high-functioning children and adolescents with ASD and 15 age-and- IQ-matched typically developing (TD) control participants took part in this fMRI study. In the MRI scanner, participants were shown cartoon pictures of people performing everyday actions (Transitive actions: e.g., ironing clothes but with the hand missing; and Intransitive actions: e.g., clapping hands with the palms missing) and were asked to identify which hand or palm orientation would best fit the gap. The main findings are: 1) both groups performed equally while processing transitive and intransitive actions; 2) both tasks yielded activation in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in ASD and TD groups; 3) Increased activation was seen in ASD children, relative to TD, in left ventral premotor and right middle temporal gyrus during intransitive actions; and 4) ASD symptom severity positively correlated with activation in left parietal, right middle temporal, and right premotor regions across all subjects. Overall, our findings suggest that regions mediating mirroring may be recruiting more brain resources in ASD and may have implications for understanding social movement through modeling. ",
pmid_23511846,Hemispheric lateralization of verbal and spatial working memory during adolescence.,,"Adult functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) literature suggests that a left-right hemispheric dissociation may exist between verbal and spatial working memory (WM), respectively. However, investigation of this type has been obscured by incomparable verbal and spatial WM tasks and/or visual inspection at arbitrary thresholds as means to assess lateralization. Furthermore, it is unclear whether this hemispheric lateralization is present during adolescence, a time in which WM skills are improving, and whether there is a developmental association with laterality of brain functioning. This study used comparable verbal and spatial WM n-back tasks during fMRI and a bootstrap analysis approach to calculate lateralization indices (LIs) across several thresholds to examine the potential of a left-right WM hemispheric dissociation in healthy adolescents. We found significant left hemispheric lateralization for verbal WM, most notably in the frontal and parietal lobes, as well as right hemisphere lateralization for spatial WM, seen in frontal and temporal cortices. Although no significant relationships were observed between LI and age or LI and performance, significant age-related patterns of brain activity were demonstrated during both verbal and spatial WM. Specifically, increased adolescent age was associated with less activity in the default mode brain network during verbal WM. In contrast, increased adolescent age was associated with greater activity in task-positive posterior parietal cortex during spatial working memory. Our findings highlight the importance of utilizing non-biased statistical methods and comparable tasks for determining patterns of functional lateralization. Our findings also suggest that, while a left-right hemispheric dissociation of verbal and spatial WM is apparent by early adolescence, age-related changes in functional activation during WM are also present. ",
pmid_15313521,Functional MRI mapping of brain activation during visually guided saccades and antisaccades: cortical and subcortical networks.,,"Antisaccade tasks require a subject to inhibit a saccade toward a briefly appearing peripheral target and instead to immediately generate a saccade to an equivalent point in the opposite hemifield. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated the neural networks required to inhibit reflexive saccades and to voluntarily generate saccades. The results demonstrated that saccade and antisaccade tasks often bilaterally activate frontal, parietal and supplementary eye fields, lenticular nuclei and occipital cortex. Additional activation of bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, supramarginal gyri, anterior cingulate cortices and thalamus was observed during antisaccade tasks. These results indicate that fronto-parietal and fronto-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits are involved in antisaccade tasks. The fronto-parietal circuit is thought to be related to the planning of saccadic eye movements that involve attentional control, while the fronto-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits connect to cortical region as a feedback network. We speculate that the abnormalities in spatial attention and eye movement control observed in schizophrenia stem from dysfunctions in the fronto-parietal and fronto-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits.

pmid_20162605,Fronto-cingulate effective connectivity in obsessive compulsive disorder: a study with fMRI and dynamic causal modeling.,,"Evidence suggests that obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is associated with an overactive error control system. A key role in error detection and control has been ascribed to the fronto-cingulate system. However, the exact functional interplay between the single components of this network in OCD is largely unknown. Therefore, the present study combined a univariate data analysis and effective connectivity analysis using dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to examine error control in 21 patients with OCD and 21 matched healthy controls. All subjects performed an adapted version of the Stroop color-word task while undergoing fMRI scans. Enhanced activation in the fronto-cingulate system could be detected in OCD patients during the incongruent task condition. Additionally, task-related modulation of effective connectivity from the dorsal ACC to left DLPFC was significantly stronger in OCD patients. These findings are consistent with an overactive error control system in OCD subserving suppression of prepotent responses during decision-making. ",

transcranial direct current stimulation","It is suggested that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can produce lasting changes in corticospinal excitability and can potentially be used for the treatment of neuropathic pain. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying the effects of tDCS are unknown. We investigated the underlying neural mechanisms of tDCS for chronic pain relief using [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([(18)F]FDG-PET). Sixteen patients with neuropathic pain (mean age 44.1 ± 8.6 years, 4 females) due to traumatic spinal cord injury received sham or active anodal stimulation of the motor cortex using tDCS for 10 days (20 minutes, 2 mA, twice a day). The effect of tDCS on regional cerebral glucose metabolism was evaluated by [(18)F]FDG-PET before and after tDCS sessions. There was a significant decrease in the numeric rating scale scores for pain, from 7.6 ± 0.5 at baseline to 5.9 ± 1.8 after active tDCS (P = .016). We found increased metabolism in the medulla and decreased metabolism in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex after active tDCS treatment compared with the changes induced by sham tDCS. Additionally, an increase in metabolism after active tDCS was observed in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and insula. The results of this study suggest that anodal stimulation of the motor cortex using tDCS can modulate emotional and cognitive components of pain and normalize excessive attention to pain and pain-related information.

pmid_25086609,Corticolimbic gating of emotion-driven punishment.,,"Determining the appropriate punishment for a norm violation requires consideration of both the perpetrator's state of mind (for example, purposeful or blameless) and the strong emotions elicited by the harm caused by their actions. It has been hypothesized that such affective responses serve as a heuristic that determines appropriate punishment. However, an actor's mental state often trumps the effect of emotions, as unintended harms may go unpunished, regardless of their magnitude. Using fMRI, we found that emotionally graphic descriptions of harmful acts amplify punishment severity, boost amygdala activity and strengthen amygdala connectivity with lateral prefrontal regions involved in punishment decision-making. However, this was only observed when the actor's harm was intentional; when harm was unintended, a temporoparietal-medial-prefrontal circuit suppressed amygdala activity and the effect of graphic descriptions on punishment was abolished. These results reveal the brain mechanisms by which evaluation of a transgressor's mental state gates our emotional urges to punish. ",

Inflammation
Obesity
Working memory","Obesity is often accompanied by lower working memory (e.g., a lower ability to keep goal-relevant information in mind) relative to healthy weight individuals. Understanding this relative working memory impairment has important clinical implications, as working memory is thought to facilitate adherence to weight management programs. Theoretical models of obesity, self-regulation, and inflammation suggest that inflammation plays a role in obesity-related working memory impairments, but to date no study has tested this prediction. Therefore, the current study examined whether inflammation statistically mediated the relationship between obesity and working memory in a nationally representative dataset of U.S. adults from Wave IV of The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 11,546, age range 25-34). Inflammation was quantified via C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and working memory was assessed using a modified digit span backward task. As expected, cross-sectional analyses showed that a body mass index (BMI) indicative of obesity-as well as greater BMI when BMI was analyzed continuously-and greater CRP were each related to lower working memory. Critically, we found that CRP levels statistically mediated the relationships between obesity/greater BMI and working memory, with CRP accounting for 44.1% of the variance explained in working memory by BMI. Moreover, these findings held both with and without controlling for relevant covariates, including demographic characteristics (e.g., age), socioeconomic status, and behavioral factors (e.g., smoking). Our results therefore point to inflammation as playing an important role in the relationship between obesity and working memory, and suggest that interventions aimed at reducing inflammation may help lessen the cognitive burden of obesity.

Voxel-based morphometry","Neuroimaging studies have implicated abnormal brain microstructure in episodic migraine (EM), but whether the pattern is altered during migraine chronification is not well known. Fifty-six patients with migraine without aura, including 39 EM patients and 17 chronic migraine (CM) patients, and 35 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled. Voxel-based morphometry analysis was performed to assess gray matter (GM) volume differences among groups and their association with clinical feature was examined. Compared with the HC group, both migraine groups showed increased GM volume in the periaqueductal grey matter (PAG) and decreased GM volume in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The left hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) volume of the HC group was smaller than that of the EM group, but was larger than that of the CM group. For the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), the EM group showed the smallest GM volume while the CM group had the largest volume. Higher headache frequency was associated with greater GM volume in the PAG and dlPFC, but was associated with smaller GM volume in the ACC and hippocampus/PHG across all patients. GM volume changes in regions involved in pain generation and control are potential neural mechanism underlying migraine, and are associated with migraine types and headache frequency. ",
pmid_16361943,Decreased regional homogeneity in schizophrenia: a resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging study.,,"We used a newly reported regional homogeneity approach to measure the temporal homogeneity of blood oxygen level-dependent signal for exploring the brain activity of schizophrenia in a resting state. The results showed decreased regional homogeneity in schizophrenia, which distributed over the bilateral frontal, temporal, occipital, cerebellar posterior, right parietal and left limbic lobes, similar to the findings reported in previous resting state functional studies. The brain regions that showed decreased regional homogeneity are believed to be involved in the psychopathology and pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Our results indicate that abnormal brain activity of schizophrenia may exist in a resting state and the regional homogeneity may be potentially helpful in understanding the resting state of schizophrenia.

pmid_19047324,Altered striatal activation predicting real-world positive affect in adolescent major depressive disorder.,,"Alterations in reward-related brain function and phenomenological aspects of positive affect are increasingly examined in the development of major depressive disorder. The authors tested differences in reward-related brain function in healthy and depressed adolescents, and the authors examined direct links between reward-related brain function and positive mood that occurred in real-world contexts. Fifteen adolescents with major depressive disorder and 28 adolescents with no history of psychiatric disorder, ages 8-17 years, completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging guessing task involving monetary reward. Participants also reported their subjective positive affect in natural environments during a 4-day cell-phone-based ecological momentary assessment. Adolescents with major depressive disorder exhibited less striatal response than healthy comparison adolescents during reward anticipation and reward outcome, but more response in dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex. Diminished activation in a caudate region associated with this depression group difference was correlated with lower subjective positive affect in natural environments, particularly within the depressed group. Results support models of altered reward processing and related positive affect in young people with major depressive disorder and indicate that depressed adolescents' brain response to monetary reward is related to their affective experience in natural environments. Additionally, these results suggest that reward-processing paradigms capture brain function relevant to real-world positive affect. ",

third-party help
third-party punishment","Social norms are a cornerstone of human society. When social norms are violated (e.g., fairness) people can either help the victim or punish the violator in order to restore justice. Recent research has shown that empathic concern influences this decision to help or punish. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we investigated the neural underpinnings of third-party help and punishment and the involvement of empathic concern. Participants saw a person violating a social norm, i.e., proposing unfair offers in a dictator game, at the expense of another person. The participants could then decide to either punish the violator or help the victim. Our results revealed that both third-party helping as well as third-party punishing activated the bilateral striatum, a region strongly related with reward processing, indicating that both altruistic decisions share a common neuronal basis. In addition, also different networks were involved in the two processes compared with control conditions; bilateral striatum and the right lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) during helping and bilateral striatum as well as left lPFC and ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during punishment. Further we found that individual differences in empathic concern influenced whether people prefer to help or to punish. People with high empathic concern helped more frequently, were faster in their decision and showed higher activation in frontoparietal regions during helping compared with punishing. Our findings provide insights into the neuronal basis of human altruistic behavior and social norm enforcement mechanism. ",

Despite an increase in children neuroimaging studies, a comprehensive neuropsychological model of mathematical functions in children is lacking. Using quantitative meta-analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, we identify concordant brain areas across articles that adhere to a set of selection criteria (e.g., whole-brain analysis, coordinate reports) and report brain activity to tasks that involve processing symbolic and non-symbolic numbers with and without formal mathematical operations, which we called respectively number tasks and calculation tasks. We present data on children 14 years and younger, who solved these tasks. Results show activity in parietal (e.g., inferior parietal lobule and precuneus) and frontal (e.g., superior and medial frontal gyri) cortices, core areas related to mental-arithmetic, as well as brain regions such as the insula and claustrum, which are not typically discussed as part of mathematical problem solving models. We propose a topographical atlas of mathematical processes in children, discuss findings within a developmental constructivist theoretical model, and suggest practical methodological considerations for future studies.

pmid_20452187,Gray-matter abnormalities in deficit schizophrenia.,,"Deficit schizophrenia (D-SZ) has been proposed as a putative disease subtype defined by prominent, primary negative symptoms that endure as trait-like features during periods of clinical stability. In this study, we acquired magnetic resonance images of the whole brain using a 1.5 T scanner in 19 outpatients with D-SZ, 31 with non-deficit schizophrenia (ND-SZ), and 90 healthy adults. Voxel-based morphometry was used to investigate differences in regional gray-matter volume (GMV) between outpatients with D-SZ and ND-SZ, and between the combined patient subgroups and healthy adults. Compared to healthy adults outpatients with schizophrenia showed GMV reductions, especially in left frontal and temporal cortices and in the left insula. The D-SZ subgroup showed reduced GMV in the insula bilaterally and in the left superior frontal, middle temporal and occipital gyri. Regions in which GMV reductions best distinguished D-SZ from ND-SZ patients included the superior frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 8) and superior temporal gyrus (Brodmann areas 22, 38) bilaterally, the left supplementary motor area (Brodmann area 6), left anterior cingulate, left cuneus and right putamen. These results suggest that patients with deficit schizophrenia have brain abnormalities that differ from those of patients with non-deficit schizophrenia. Further, the neuroanatomic differences between these two putative subtypes of schizophrenia involve brain regions that appear to be associated with the negative symptoms that define the deficit syndrome of schizophrenia.

pmid_20484652,Functional neuroanatomy supporting judgments of when events occurred.,,"The neural substrates of memory for when events occurred are not well described. One reason for this is that the paradigms used to date have permitted isolation of only some of the relevant memory processes. In this experiment, functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to identify for the first time brain regions that support two distinct bases upon which ""when"" judgments can be made. Seventeen human participants (6 male) completed a continuous recognition memory task where the interval between presentation and re-presentation of words varied between 5 and 25 intervening words (the lag). The task on each trial was to distinguish repeated words from those presented for the first time, and to indicate the lag for repeated words. The inferior parietal lobe showed greater activation for shorter lag judgments, regardless of judgment accuracy. The lingual gyrus, by contrast, was more active for correct than for incorrect lag judgments, regardless of the interval between first and second item presentations. Both of these regions have been linked in previous work to the process of recollection, and the findings described here represent a novel neural dissociation across regions that deploy mnemonic information in fundamentally different ways to support judgments about when events occurred. ",
pmid_21507149,fMRI and MEG analysis of visceral pain in healthy volunteers.,,"Although many studies of painful rectal stimulation have found activation in the insula, cingulate, somatosensory, prefrontal cortices and thalamus, there is considerable variability when comparing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results. Multiple factors may be responsible, including the model used in fMRI data analysis. Here, we assess the temporal response of activity to rectal barostat distension using novel fMRI and magnetoencephalography (MEG) analysis. Liminal and painful rectal barostat balloon inflation thresholds were assessed in 14 female healthy volunteers. Subliminal, liminal and painful 40s periods of distension were applied in a pseudo-randomized paradigm during fMRI and MEG neuroimaging. Functional MRI data analysis was performed comparing standard box-car models of the full 40s of stimulus (Block) with models of the inflation (Ramp-On) and deflation (Ramp-Off) of the barostat. Similar models were used in MEG analysis of oscillatory activity. Modeling the data using a standard Block analysis failed to detect areas of interest found to be active using Ramp-On and Ramp-Off models. Ramp-On generated activity in anterior insula and cingulate regions and other pain-matrix associated areas. Ramp-Off demonstrated activity of a network of posterior insula, SII and posterior cingulate. Active areas were consistent with those identified from MEG data. In studies of visceral pain, fMRI model design strongly influences the detected activity and must be accounted for to effectively explore the fMRI data in healthy subjects and within patient groups. In particular a strong cortical response is detected to inflation and deflation of the barostat, rather than to its absolute volume. ",
pmid_12948707,Increased frontocerebellar activation in alcoholics during verbal working memory: an fMRI study.,,"Although there is clear evidence of alcoholism-related damage to the frontal lobes and cerebellum from neuroimaging, neuropathological, and neuropsychological studies, the functional role of the cerebellum and cerebrocerebellar circuits related to verbal working memory deficits of alcoholics have not been well studied. Alcoholic and nonalcoholic subjects performed a Sternberg verbal working memory task while receiving an fMRI scan in a 3T magnet. This task has been found in previous studies to reliably activate the articulatory control and phonological storage components of the phonological loop (left frontal, left temporal/parietal structures, right superior cerebellar regions) in young healthy controls. We hypothesized that the alcoholics would show a different pattern of activation from the controls, based on the regions of interest (ROIs) identified from a previous study of healthy subjects. Behavioral results showed the alcoholics to be performing at a comparable level to the matched controls in terms of accuracy and median reaction time, with no statistically significant differences. However, analysis of the functional data revealed that the alcoholics exhibited greater activation in the left frontal (BA44/45) and right superior cerebellum (HVI) regions relative to the matched controls. These findings suggest that brain activation in left frontal and right cerebellar regions that support the articulatory control system of verbal working memory may require a compensatory increase in alcoholics in order to maintain the same level of performance as controls.

Quality of life","The Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is a newly developed comprehensive tool to assess Parkinson's disease (PD), which covers a wider range of non-motor PD manifestations than the original UPDRS scale. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the MDS-UPDRS and Quality of Life (QoL) and to analyze the relationship between individual MDS-UPDRS non-motor items and QoL. A total of 291 PD patients were examined in a multicenter Slovak study. Patients were assessed by the MDS-UPDRS, HY scale and PDQ39. Data were analyzed using the multiple regression analyses. The mean participant age was 68.0 ± 9.0 years, 53.5% were men, mean disease duration was 8.3 ± 5.3 years and mean HY was 2.7 ± 1.0. In a multiple regression analysis model the PDQ39 summary index was related to MDS-UPDRS parts II, I and IV respectively, but not to part III. Individual MDS-UPDRS non-motor items related to the PDQ39 summary index in the summary group and in the non-fluctuating patients subgroup were pain, fatigue and features of dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS). In the fluctuating PD patient subgroup, PDQ39 was related to pain and Depressed mood items. Other MDS-UPDRS non-motor items e.g. Anxious mood, Apathy, Cognitive impairment, Hallucinations and psychosis, Sleep problems, Daytime sleepiness and Urinary problems were related to some PDQ39 domains. The overall burden of NMS in PD is more important in terms of QoL than motor symptoms. Individual MDS-UPDRS non-motor items related to worse QoL are especially pain and other sensations, fatigue and features of DDS. ",

The performance (accuracy and response times) of 25 Low Autistic Traits (LAT group) young adults (21 males) and 20 young adults (16 males) with either High Autistic Traits or with High Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder (HAT group) was compared in the recognition of four emotions (Happiness, Anger, Fear, and Sadness) either shown in static faces or conveyed by moving body patch-light displays (PLDs). Overall, HAT individuals were as accurate as LAT ones in perceiving emotions both with faces and with PLDs. Moreover, they correctly described non-emotional actions depicted by PLDs, indicating that they perceived the motion conveyed by the PLDs per se. For LAT participants, happiness proved to be the easiest emotion to be recognized: in line with previous studies we found a happy face advantage for faces, which for the first time was also found for bodies (happy body advantage). Furthermore, LAT participants recognized sadness better by static faces and fear by PLDs. This advantage for motion kinematics in the recognition of fear was not present in HAT participants, suggesting that (i) emotion recognition is not generally impaired in HAT individuals, (ii) the cues exploited for emotion recognition by LAT and HAT groups are not always the same. These findings are discussed against the background of emotional processing in typically and atypically developed individuals. ",
pmid_22524295,Inducing negative affect increases the reward value of appetizing foods in dieters.,,"Experiencing negative affect frequently precedes lapses in self-control for dieters, smokers, and drug addicts. Laboratory research has similarly shown that inducing negative emotional distress increases the consumption of food or drugs. One hypothesis for this finding is that emotional distress sensitizes the brain's reward system to appetitive stimuli. Using functional neuroimaging, we demonstrate that inducing negative affect in chronic dieters increases activity in brain regions representing the reward value of appetitive stimuli when viewing appetizing food cues. Thirty female chronic dieters were randomly assigned to receive either a negative (n = 15) or neutral mood induction (n = 15) immediately followed by exposure to images of appetizing foods and natural scenes during fMRI. Compared with chronic dieters in a neutral mood, those receiving a negative mood induction showed increased activity in the OFC to appetizing food images. In addition, activity to food images in the OFC and ventral striatum was correlated with individual differences in the degree to which the negative mood induction decreased participants' self-esteem. These findings suggest that distress sensitizes the brain's reward system to appetitive cues, thereby offering a mechanism for the oft-observed relationship between negative affect and disinhibited eating. ",
pmid_17401515,Brain responses to emotional stimuli in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).,,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a progressive motor neuron disease, affects movement and communication abilities and emotional processing. Subjective ratings of emotional stimuli depicting social interactions and facial expressions differed significantly between ALS patients and healthy controls in a previous study with a reduction of negative emotional valence (pleasantness) and lower subjective arousal (excitement) in ALS patients. In the present study, sixty similar emotional slides were presented to 13 ALS patients, 15 matched healthy controls and six tetraplegic patients. Subjective reports of valence and arousal as well as brain responses to the affective pictures using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were measured. The picture series was presented twice with a 6-months interval to investigate effects of disease progression. ALS patients presented an increased brain response in the right supramarginal area and a reduced brain response in extrastriate visual areas at both measurements compared with healthy controls. Within the ALS patients' group a reduction of brain responses in the anterior insula at the follow-up was correlated with the subjective arousal. The reduced response in the anterior insula is tentatively interpreted as indicating reduced arousal during the course of the disease at the neural and behavioural level. The reduction of activity in extrastriate visual areas might be similarly interpreted. The increased brain response in the right supramarginal area of ALS patients might represent an altered sensitivity to social-emotional cues. ",

Previously published papers, using [(18)F]-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), have suggested an increased metabolism in the left primary auditory cortex in tinnitus patients. This unilateral hyperactivity has been used as a target in localized treatments such as transcranial magnetic stimulation. The purpose of the current study was to test whether left-sided hyperactivity in the auditory cortex is specific to tinnitus or is a general characteristic of the auditory system unrelated to tinnitus. Therefore, FDG-PET was used to measure brain metabolism in 20 tinnitus patients and to compare their results to those in 19 control subjects without tinnitus. In contrast to our expectation, there was no hyperactivity associated with tinnitus. Nevertheless, the activity in the left primary auditory cortex was higher than in the right primary auditory cortex, but this asymmetry was present in both tinnitus patients and control subjects. In contrast, the lateralization in secondary auditory cortex was opposite, with higher activation in the right hemisphere. These data show that hemisphere asymmetries in the metabolic resting activity of the auditory cortex are present, but these are not associated with tinnitus and are a normal characteristic of the normal brain.

pmid_18797307,Neuroanatomy of verbal working memory as a diagnostic biomarker for depression.,,"The functional neuroanatomy of verbal working memory is a potential diagnostic biomarker for depression. Twenty patients with unipolar depression and 20 healthy controls performed a variable load version (n-back) of the task. Functional MRI data were analysed with support vector machine methods. Diagnostic classification was highest at the mid-level of task difficulty (2-back) (sensitivity 65%, specificity 70%, P<0.009). Significant classification of clinical response (>or=50% reduction in clinical symptom ratings) was found at the most difficult level (3-back) (sensitivity 85%, specificity 52%, P<0.003). The functional neuroanatomy of verbal working memory provides a statistically significant but clinically moderate contribution as a diagnostic biomarker for depression, whereas its potential as a neural predictor of clinical response requires further investigation.

Given these results and the vital need to treat the comorbidity of the two disorders, a pilot ACT treatment was implemented in individuals with comorbid chronic pain and opioid addiction.

Loss aversion
Monetary incentive delay task
Reward processing","Current models of addiction biology highlight altered neural responses to non-drug rewards as a central feature of addiction. However, given that drugs of abuse can directly impact reward-related dopamine circuitry, it is difficult to determine the extent to which reward processing alterations are a trait feature of individuals with addictions, or primarily a consequence of exogenous drug exposure. Examining individuals with behavioral addictions is one promising approach for disentangling neural features of addiction from the direct effects of substance exposure. The current fMRI study compared neural responses during monetary reward processing between drug naïve young adults with a behavioral addiction, internet gaming disorder (IGD; n = 22), and healthy controls (n = 27) using a monetary incentive delay task. Relative to controls, individuals with IGD exhibited blunted caudate activity associated with loss magnitude at the outcome stage, but did not differ from controls in neural activity at other stages. These findings suggest that decreased loss sensitivity might be a critical feature of IGD, whereas alterations in gain processing may be less characteristic of individuals with IGD, relative to those with substance use disorders. Therefore, classic theories of altered reward processing in substance use disorders should be translated to behavioral addictions with caution. ",

However, the exact pathophysiology of IA remains unclear. Most of functional connectivity studies were based on pre-selected regions of interest (ROI), which could not provide a comprehensive picture of the communication abnormalities in IA, and might lead to limited or bias observations. Using local functional connectivity density (lFCD), this study aimed to explore the whole-brain abnormalities of functional connectivity in IA. We evaluated the whole-brain lFCD resulting from resting-state fMRI data in 28 IA individuals and 30 demographically matched healthy control subjects (HCs). The correlations between clinical characteristics and aberrant lFCD were also assessed. Compared with HCs, subjects with IA exhibited heightened lFCD values in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), left parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), and cerebellum, and the bilateral middle cingulate cortex (MCC) and superior temporal pole (STP), as well as decreased lFCD values in the right inferior parietal lobe (IPL), and bilateral calcarine and lingual gyrus. Voxel-based correlation analysis revealed the significant correlations between the Young's Internet Addiction Test (IAT) score and altered lFCD values in the left PHG and bilateral STP. These findings revealed the hyper-connectivity in cognitive control network and default mode network as well as the hypo-connectivity in visual attention network, verifying the common mechanism in IA and substance addiction, and the underlying association between IA, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder in terms of neurobiology.

pmid_20006717,Altered activation in association with reward-related trial-and-error learning in patients with schizophrenia.,,"In patients with schizophrenia, the ability to learn from reinforcement is known to be impaired. The present fMRI study aimed at investigating the neural correlates of reinforcement-related trial-and-error learning in 19 schizophrenia patients and 20 healthy volunteers. A modified gambling paradigm was applied where each cue indicated a subsequent number which had to be guessed. In order to vary predictability, the cue-number associations were based on different probabilities (50%, 81%, 100%) which the participants were not informed about. Patients' ability to learn contingencies on the basis of feedback and reward was significantly impaired. While in healthy volunteers increasing predictability was associated with decreasing activation in a fronto-parietal network, this decrease was not detectable in patients. Analysis of expectancy-related reinforcement processing yielded a hypoactivation in putamen, dorsal cingulate and superior frontal cortex in patients relative to controls. Present results indicate that both reinforcement-associated processing and reinforcement learning might be impaired in the context of the disorder. They moreover suggest that the activation deficits which patients exhibit in association with the processing of reinforcement might constitute the basis for the learning deficits and their accompanying activation alterations.

During scanning, responders either played the standard UG with proposers (control condition) or played the modified UG in which three unknown observers showed social support for responders by acknowledging proposers' norm violation. Results revealed that participants reported higher unfairness feelings and rejection rates of unfair offers in the social support condition relative to the control condition. At the neural level, compared to the control condition, perception of social support from others induced greater activations of anterior cingulate gyrus and right anterior insula when receiving unfair (vs. fair) offers. The medial prefrontal cortex and right anterior insula were more active when the unfair offers were rejected (vs. accepted) in the social support condition than the control condition. These results highlighted the modulation effect of social support on responders' fairness considerations and related decision-making processes. ",
pmid_18687957,The rupture and repair of cooperation in borderline personality disorder.,,"To sustain or repair cooperation during a social exchange, adaptive creatures must understand social gestures and the consequences when shared expectations about fair exchange are violated by accident or intent. We recruited 55 individuals afflicted with borderline personality disorder (BPD) to play a multiround economic exchange game with healthy partners. Behaviorally, individuals with BPD showed a profound incapacity to maintain cooperation, and were impaired in their ability to repair broken cooperation on the basis of a quantitative measure of coaxing. Neurally, activity in the anterior insula, a region known to respond to norm violations across affective, interoceptive, economic, and social dimensions, strongly differentiated healthy participants from individuals with BPD. Healthy subjects showed a strong linear relation between anterior insula response and both magnitude of monetary offer received from their partner (input) and the amount of money repaid to their partner (output). In stark contrast, activity in the anterior insula of BPD participants was related only to the magnitude of repayment sent back to their partner (output), not to the magnitude of offers received (input). These neural and behavioral data suggest that norms used in perception of social gestures are pathologically perturbed or missing altogether among individuals with BPD. This game-theoretic approach to psychopathology may open doors to new ways of characterizing and studying a range of mental illnesses. ",
pmid_16946187,Increased brain activation during working memory in cognitively intact adults with the APOE epsilon4 allele.,,"Altered patterns of brain activity during cognitive tasks have been demonstrated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. However, there have been few studies of adults at genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease prior to the onset of symptoms. The purpose of this study was to determine whether brain activation patterns associated with working memory differ as a function of apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype in cognitively intact adults. Participants were cognitively intact, healthy adults who completed genotyping, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and structural and functional neuroimaging. Twenty-two participants had the APOE epsilon3/epsilon3 genotype, and 13 participants had the APOE epsilon3/epsilon4 genotype. The study employed an auditory verbal N-back task to probe working memory-related brain activity. The epsilon3/epsilon3 and epsilon3/epsilon4 groups did not differ in demographic characteristics, cognitive ability, mood, or in-scanner task performance. The epsilon3/epsilon4 group showed greater activity during working memory in the medial frontal and parietal regions bilaterally and in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. There were no regions in which the epsilon3/epsilon3 group showed greater activation than the epsilon3/epsilon4 group. These results indicate that differences in brain activity are evident in cognitively intact individuals who are at risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease by virtue of their APOE allele status. As neuroprotective interventions become available, early detection will increase in importance. The combination of genetic and functional neuroimaging strategies may prove useful for monitoring individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease before the onset of cognitive symptoms. ",
pmid_21316204,Amygdala hyperreactivity in restrictive anorexia nervosa.,,"Functional imaging studies had often investigated heterogeneous samples of anorexia nervosa (AN) patients with varying paradigms and methodologies that had resulted in divergent results. The present study aimed to examine these issues by studying a well-defined sample of restrictive AN patients with a disorder-specific paradigm which had been used previously. Subjects showed increased blood oxygen level dependent responses of the cingulate, frontal, insular and parietal cortices. Group comparisons demonstrated increased activity of the right amygdala in the sample of restrictive AN patients. Our results are in support of other recently published functional imaging studies and point to a pivotal role of the right amygdala in AN. Signals of the midcingulum were reduced in comparison to healthy controls. The constellation of increased activity of the amygdala and decreased activity of the cingulate cortex likely represents parts of a negative feedback loop of emotional processing. Disgust ratings correlated with the amygdala signal negatively, which points to the complex role of this structure within eating disorders. ",
pmid_15006042,Neural substrates of response-based sequence learning using fMRI.,,"Representation of sequential structure can occur with respect to the order of perceptual events or the order in which actions are linked. Neural correlates of sequence retrieval associated with the order of motor responses were identified in a variant of the serial reaction time task in which training occurred with a spatially incompatible mapping between stimuli and finger responses. After transfer to a spatially compatible version of the task, performance enhancements indicative of learning were only present in subjects required to make finger movements in the same order used during training. In contrast, a second group of subjects performed the compatible task using an identical sequence of stimuli (and different order of finger movements) as in training. They demonstrated no performance benefit, indicating that learning was response based. Analysis was restricted to subjects demonstrating low recall of the sequence structure to rule out effects of explicit awareness. The interaction of group (motor vs. perceptual transfer) with sequence retrieval (sequencing vs. rest) revealed significantly greater activation in the bilateral supplementary motor area, cingulate motor area, ventral premotor cortex, left caudate, and inferior parietal lobule for subjects in the motor group (illustrating successful sequence retrieval at the response level).

pmid_22571805,Heterogeneity of amygdala response in major depressive disorder: the impact of lifetime subthreshold mania.,,"Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) present with highly heterogeneous symptom profiles. We aimed to examine whether individual differences in amygdala activity to emotionally salient stimuli were related to heterogeneity in lifetime levels of depressive and subthreshold manic symptoms among adults with MDD. We compared age- and gender-matched adults with MDD (n = 26) with healthy controls (HC, n = 28). While undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants performed an implicit emotional faces task: they labeled a color flash superimposed upon initially neutral faces that dynamically morphed into one of four emotions (angry, fearful, sad, happy). Region of interest analyses examined group differences in amygdala activity. For conditions in which adults with MDD displayed abnormal amygdala activity versus HC, within-group analyses examined amygdala activity as a function of scores on a continuous measure of lifetime depression-related and mania-related pathology. Adults with MDD showed significantly greater right-sided amygdala activity to angry and happy conditions than HC (p < 0.05, corrected). Multiple regression analyses revealed that greater right-amygdala activity to the happy condition in adults with MDD was associated with higher levels of subthreshold manic symptoms experienced across the lifespan (p = 0.002). Among depressed adults with MDD, lifetime features of subthreshold mania were associated with abnormally elevated amygdala activity to emerging happy faces. These findings are a first step toward identifying biomarkers that reflect individual differences in neural mechanisms in MDD, and challenge conventional mood disorder diagnostic boundaries by suggesting that some adults with MDD are characterized by pathophysiological processes that overlap with bipolar disorder.

Magnetic resonance T1-weighted images were processed by voxel-based morphometry, and the findings were correlated with clinical variables and treatment responses. A total of 66 patients with CM (half with MO) and 33 HCs completed the study. Patients with CMwMO compared to the patients with CMwoMO showed gray matter volume (GMV) decrease in the orbitofrontal cortex and left middle occipital gyrus as well as GMV increase in the left temporal pole/parahippocampus. The GMV changes explained 31.1% variance of the analgesics use frequency. The patients who responded to treatment had greater GMV in the orbitofrontal cortex (p = 0.028). Patients with CM (with and without MO), compared with HCs, had decreased GMV at multiple brain areas including the frontal, temporal and occipital lobes, precuneus and cerebellum. Our study showed GMV changes in CMwMO patients compared to the CMwoMO patients. These three cerebral regions accounted for significant variance in analgesics use frequency. Moreover, the GMV of the orbitofrontal cortex was predictive of the response to MO treatments. ",

The relevant computational and motivational mechanisms that underlie its heterogeneity, however, are poorly understood. Using a charitable giving task together with multivariate decoding techniques, we identified three distinct psychological mechanisms underlying altruistic decision-making (empathy, perspective taking, and attentional reorienting) and linked them to dissociable neural computations. Neural responses in the anterior insula (AI) (but not temporoparietal junction [TPJ]) encoded trial-wise empathy for beneficiaries, whereas the TPJ (but not AI) predicted the degree of perspective taking. Importantly, the relative influence of both socio-cognitive processes differed across individuals: participants whose donation behavior was heavily influenced by affective empathy exhibited higher predictive accuracies for generosity in AI, whereas those who strongly relied on cognitive perspective taking showed improved predictions of generous donations in TPJ. Furthermore, subject-specific contributions of both processes for donations were reflected in participants' empathy and perspective taking responses in a separate fMRI task (EmpaToM), suggesting that process-specific inputs into altruistic choices may reflect participants' general propensity to either empathize or mentalize. Finally, using independent attention task data, we identified shared neural codes for attentional reorienting and generous donations in the posterior superior temporal sulcus, suggesting that domain-general attention shifts also contribute to generous behavior (but not in TPJ or AI). Overall, our findings demonstrate highly specific roles of AI for affective empathy and TPJ for cognitive perspective taking as precursors of prosocial behavior and suggest that these discrete routes of social cognition differentially drive intraindividual and interindividual differences in altruistic behavior. Human societies depend on the altruistic behavior of their members, but teasing apart its underlying motivations and neural mechanisms poses a serious challenge. Using multivariate decoding techniques, we delineated three distinct processes for altruistic decision-making (affective empathy, cognitive perspective taking, and domain-general attention shifts), linked them to dissociable neural computations, and identified their relative influence across individuals. Distinguishing process-specific computations both behaviorally and neurally is crucial for developing complete theoretical and neuroscientific accounts of altruistic behavior and more effective means of increasing it. Moreover, information on the relative influence of subprocesses across individuals and its link to people's more general propensity to engage empathy or perspective taking can inform training programs to increase prosociality, considering their ""fit"" with different individuals.

To achieve a clear understanding of the neurobiological features of IGD, we aimed to identify morphological and functional changes in IGD and compare them with those in AUD. Individuals with IGD showed larger volume in the hippocampus/amygdala and precuneus than healthy controls (HCs). The volume in the hippocampus positively correlated with the symptom severity of IGD. Moreover, functional connectivity analysis with the hippocampus/amygdala cluster revealed that the left ventromedial prefrontal cortex showed stronger functional connectivity in individuals with IGD compared to those with AUD. In contrast, individuals with AUD exhibited the smaller cerebellar volume and thinner medial frontal cortex than HCs. The volume in the cerebellum correlated with impaired working memory function as well as duration of illness in AUD group. Findings suggested that altered volume and functional connectivity in the hippocampus/amygdala in IGD might be associated with abnormally enhanced memory process of gaming-related cues, while abnormal cortical changes and cognitive impairments in AUD might be associated with neurotoxic effects of alcohol.

resting-state functional connectivity","Human altruistic behaviors are heterogeneous across both contexts and people, whereas the neural signatures underlying the heterogeneity remain to be elucidated. To address this issue, we examined the neural signatures underlying the context- and person-dependent altruistic punishment, conjoining event-related fMRI with both task-based and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). Acting as an impartial third party, participants decided how to punish norm violators either alone or in the presence of putative others. We found that the presence of others decreased altruistic punishment due to diffusion of responsibility. Those behavioral effects paralleled altered neural responses in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and putamen. Further, we identified modulation of responsibility diffusion on task-based functional connectivity of dACC with the brain regions implicated in reward processing (i.e., posterior cingulate cortex and amygdala/orbital frontal cortex). Finally, the RSFC results revealed that (i) increased intrinsic connectivity strengths of the putamen with temporoparietal junction and dorsolateral PFC were associated with attenuated responsibility diffusion in altruistic punishment and (ii) increased putamen-dorsomedial PFC connectivity strengths were associated with reduced responsibility diffusion in self-reported responsibility. Taken together, our findings elucidate the context- and person-dependent altruistic behaviors as well as associated neural substrates and thus provide a potential neurocognitive mechanism of heterogeneous human altruistic behaviors.

pmid_18256259,"Beyond feeling: chronic pain hurts the brain, disrupting the default-mode network dynamics.",,"Chronic pain patients suffer from more than just pain; depression and anxiety, sleep disturbances, and decision-making abnormalities (Apkarian et al., 2004a) also significantly diminish their quality of life. Recent studies have demonstrated that chronic pain harms cortical areas unrelated to pain (Apkarian et al., 2004b; Acerra and Moseley, 2005), but whether these structural impairments and behavioral deficits are connected by a single mechanism is as of yet unknown. Here we propose that long-term pain alters the functional connectivity of cortical regions known to be active at rest, i.e., the components of the ""default mode network"" (DMN). This DMN (Raichle et al., 2001; Greicius et al., 2003; Vincent et al., 2007) is marked by balanced positive and negative correlations between activity in component brain regions. In several disorders, however this balance is disrupted (Fox and Raichle, 2007). Using well validated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigms to study the DMN (Fox et al., 2005), we investigated whether the impairments of chronic pain patients could be rooted in disturbed DMN dynamics. Studying with fMRI a group of chronic back pain (CBP) patients and healthy controls while executing a simple visual attention task, we discovered that CBP patients, despite performing the task equally well as controls, displayed reduced deactivation in several key DMN regions. These findings demonstrate that chronic pain has a widespread impact on overall brain function, and suggest that disruptions of the DMN may underlie the cognitive and behavioral impairments accompanying chronic pain.

pmid_20004364,Anhedonia and emotional experience in schizophrenia: neural and behavioral indicators.,,"Emotional impairments such as anhedonia are often considered key features of schizophrenia. However, self-report research suggests that emotional experience in response to affect-eliciting stimuli is intact in schizophrenia. Investigation of neural activity during emotional experience may help clarify whether symptoms of anhedonia more likely reflect alterations of in-the-moment hedonic experience or impairments in other aspects of goal-directed behavior. Forty individuals with DSM-IV-TR schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 32 healthy control subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while making valence and arousal ratings in response to emotional pictures, words, and faces. Blood oxygen level-dependent responses were compared between patients and control subjects and were correlated with questionnaire measures of anhedonia. Patients showed some evidence of blunted valence but not arousal ratings in response to emotional stimuli compared with control subjects. Higher anhedonia scores were associated with blunted valence ratings in both groups and fully mediated the group differences in valence ratings. Functional activity was largely intact in patients, except for regions in right ventral striatum and left putamen, which showed reduced responses to positive stimuli. Higher anhedonia was associated with reduced activation to positive versus negative stimuli in bilateral amygdala and right ventral striatum in patients and in bilateral caudate in control subjects. Increased anhedonia is associated with a reduced experience of valence in both patients and control subjects, and group differences in experienced valence are likely driven by individual differences in anhedonia. Reduced activation of the striatum and amygdala may contribute to symptoms of anhedonia by failing to signal the salience of positive events. ",
pmid_22418013,Alterations of the brain reward system in antipsychotic naïve schizophrenia patients.,,"Various schizophrenic symptoms are suggested to be linked to a dysfunction of the brain reward system. Several studies have found alterations in the reward processing in patients with schizophrenia; however, most previous findings might be confounded by medication effects. Thirty-one antipsychotic-naïve schizophrenia patients and 31 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects were examined with functional magnetic resonance imaging while playing a variant of the monetary incentive delay task. The task variant made it possible to separate overall salience (defined as arousing events) into behavioral salience (events where a predicted reward requires performance) and valence anticipation (the anticipation of a monetarily significant outcome). Furthermore, the evaluation of monetary gain and loss was assessed. During reward anticipation, patients had a significant attenuation of the activation in ventral tegmentum, ventral striatum, and anterior cingulate cortex during presentation of salient cues. This signal attenuation in ventral striatum was correlated with the degree of positive symptoms. Signal attenuation was most pronounced for behavioral salience and nonsignificant for value anticipation. Furthermore, patients showed a changed activation pattern during outcome evaluation in right prefrontal cortex. Our results suggest that changes during reward anticipation in schizophrenia are present from the beginning of the disease. This supports a possible involvement of reward disturbances in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The most pronounced changes were seen in relation to overall salience. In ventral striatum these changes were associated with the degree of positive symptoms. ",
pmid_23607410,Neural correlates of treatment in adolescents with bipolar depression during response inhibition.,,"Abnormal prefrontal and subcortical activity during cognitive control tasks is identified in non-depressed adolescents with bipolar disorder (BD); however, little is known about the neural correlates of bipolar adolescents in a depressed state (BDd). We aimed to investigate baseline versus after-treatment patterns of neural activity underlying motor response and response inhibition in adolescents with BDd. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, 10 adolescents with BDd relative to 10 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) completed a well-validated go/no go block-design cognitive control task at baseline and after 6 weeks of naturalistic treatment. We used whole-brain analysis and controlled our results for multiple comparisons. There was significant improvement in depression scores (mean change: 57%±28). There was no behavioral difference in BDd baseline versus HC and after treatment. BDd adolescents relative to HC had higher baseline cortical, but not subcortical, neural activity (e.g., bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal during both the go [motor control] and the no go [response inhibition] conditions, and left superior temporal during the no go condition). However, after-treatment activity relative to baseline neural activity during response inhibition was significantly increased in subcortical (e.g., right hippocampus and left thalamus), but not cortical, regions. In addition, at baseline, lower left thalamus activity was correlated with higher depression scores. Adolescents with BDd had baseline prefrontal and temporal hyperactivity underlying motor control and response inhibition that did not change after treatment in contrast to relatively decreased baseline subcortical activity underlying response inhibition associated with the depressive state that was increased after the treatment.

directional selectivity
egocentric reach
fMRI","The location of a remembered reach target can be encoded in egocentric and/or allocentric reference frames. Cortical mechanisms for egocentric reach are relatively well described, but the corresponding allocentric representations are essentially unknown. Here, we used an event-related fMRI design to distinguish human brain areas involved in these two types of representation. Our paradigm consisted of three tasks with identical stimulus display but different instructions: egocentric reach (remember absolute target location), allocentric reach (remember target location relative to a visual landmark), and a nonspatial control, color report (report color of target). During the delay phase (when only target location was specified), the egocentric and allocentric tasks elicited widely overlapping regions of cortical activity (relative to the control), but with higher activation in parietofrontal cortex for egocentric task and higher activation in early visual cortex for allocentric tasks. In addition, egocentric directional selectivity (target relative to gaze) was observed in the superior occipital gyrus and the inferior occipital gyrus, whereas allocentric directional selectivity (target relative to a visual landmark) was observed in the inferior temporal gyrus and inferior occipital gyrus. During the response phase (after movement direction had been specified either by reappearance of the visual landmark or a pro-/anti-reach instruction), the parietofrontal network resumed egocentric directional selectivity, showing higher activation for contralateral than ipsilateral reaches. These results show that allocentric and egocentric reach mechanisms use partially overlapping but different cortical substrates and that directional specification is different for target memory versus reach response.

pmid_19159693,Effects of acute nicotine on brain function in healthy smokers and non-smokers: estimation of inter-individual response heterogeneity.,,"The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural mechanisms of nicotine effects on antisaccades (an oculomotor measure of the conflict between a reflexive response and a spatially complex volitional response) and prosaccades (involving reflexive overt attentional shifts). Given the known inter-individual variability in drug response we aimed to identify oculomotor variables and brain areas in which significant inter-individual heterogeneity in response to nicotine is observed. To do so we calculated within-session intraclass correlation (ICC) coefficients over measurements obtained before and after nicotine/placebo administration and reasoned that a significant reduction in ICC with nicotine compared to placebo would reflect the operation of significant inter-individual response heterogeneity. Thirteen light-to-moderate smokers and 11 non-smokers completed fMRI during antisaccades before and after subcutaneous injection of 12 microg/kg nicotine or saline placebo in a double-blind, randomised, cross-over design. All participants were healthy, right-handed males. Nicotine and placebo were given on separate occasions approximately 1 week apart with time of injection kept constant. Nicotine significantly reduced antisaccade latencies in both groups. At the level of brain function, during antisaccades the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response in the left frontal eye field was non-significantly reduced by nicotine while it significantly increased following placebo in non-smokers, but there was no discernible effect in smokers. During prosaccades, it was found that deactivation areas (posterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus; right superior temporal gyrus) showed enhanced deactivations following nicotine administration in both groups. ICC analysis identified significant inter-individual response heterogeneity in antisaccade reflexive errors in smokers, and in a number of brain regions, particularly in non-smokers. These findings suggest that nicotine has beneficial effects at the cognitive level and leads to reductions in task-related activations and further decreases of BOLD in deactivation areas. The comparison of within-session ICCs across drug conditions suggests that the effects of nicotine are subject to inter-individual variability at behavioural and neural levels. ",

Nineteen predominantly right-handed ALS patients and 21 controls underwent clinical evaluation, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), and diffusion tensor imaging. Patients were clinically re-evaluated 1 year later and followed until death. For fMRI, subjects executed and imagined a simple hand-motor task. Between-group comparisons were performed, and correlations were searched with motor deficit arm Medical Research Council (MRC) score, disease progression ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS), and survival time. By the MRC score, the hand strength was lowered by 12% in the ALS group predominating on the right side in accordance with an abnormal fractional anisotropy (FA) limited to the left corticospinal tract (37.3% reduction vs. controls P < 0.01). Compared to controls, patients displayed overactivations in the controlateral parietal (P < 0.004) and somatosensory (P < 0.004) cortex and in the ipsilateral parietal (P < 0.01) and somatosensory (P < 0.01) cortex to right-hand movement. Movement imagination gave similar results while no difference occurred with left-hand tasks. Stepwise regression analysis corrected for multiple comparisons showed that controlateral parietal activity was inversely correlated with disease progression (R(2) = 0.43, P = 0.001) and ipsilateral somatosensory activations with the severity of the right-arm deficit (R(2) = 0.48, P = 0.001). Cortical Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal changes occur in the brain of ALS patients during a simple hand-motor task when the motor deficit is still moderate. It is correlated with the rate of disease progression suggesting that brain functional rearrangement in ALS may have prognostic implications. ",

Prefrontal cortex-striatal circuits","Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) among adolescents has become an important public concern and gained more and more attention internationally. Recent studies focused on IGD and revealed brain abnormalities in the IGD group, especially the prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, the role of PFC-striatal circuits in pathology of IGD remains unknown. Twenty-five adolescents with IGD and 21 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were recruited in our study. Voxel-based morphometric (VBM) and functional connectivity analysis were employed to investigate the abnormal structural and resting-state properties of several frontal regions in individuals with online gaming addiction. Relative to healthy comparison subjects, IGD subjects showed significant decreased gray matter volume in PFC regions including the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the right supplementary motor area (SMA) after controlling for age and gender effects. We chose these regions as the seeding areas for the resting-state analysis and found that IGD subjects showed decreased functional connectivity between several cortical regions and our seeds, including the insula, and temporal and occipital cortices. Moreover, significant decreased functional connectivity between some important subcortical regions, i.e., dorsal striatum, pallidum, and thalamus, and our seeds were found in the IGD group and some of those changes were associated with the severity of IGD. Our results revealed the involvement of several PFC regions and related PFC-striatal circuits in the process of IGD and suggested IGD may share similar neural mechanisms with substance dependence at the circuit level.

pmid_17519340,Neural signature of fictive learning signals in a sequential investment task.,,"Reinforcement learning models now provide principled guides for a wide range of reward learning experiments in animals and humans. One key learning (error) signal in these models is experiential and reports ongoing temporal differences between expected and experienced reward. However, these same abstract learning models also accommodate the existence of another class of learning signal that takes the form of a fictive error encoding ongoing differences between experienced returns and returns that ""could-have-been-experienced"" if decisions had been different. These observations suggest the hypothesis that, for all real-world learning tasks, one should expect the presence of both experiential and fictive learning signals. Motivated by this possibility, we used a sequential investment game and fMRI to probe ongoing brain responses to both experiential and fictive learning signals generated throughout the game. Using a large cohort of subjects (n = 54), we report that fictive learning signals strongly predict changes in subjects' investment behavior and correlate with fMRI signals measured in dopaminoceptive structures known to be involved in valuation and choice.

Our aim is to communicate with patients with disorders of consciousness through asking them to answer questions with ""yes/no"" by performing mental imagery tasks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A 1.5 T fMRI study with 5 patients and a control group is presented. Speech comprehension, mental imagery, and question-answer tests were performed. The imagery task of mental calculation produced equally distinct activation patterns when compared to navigation and motor imagery in controls. For controls, we could infer answers to questions based on imagery activations. Two patients produced activations in similar areas to controls for certain imagery tasks, however, no activations were observed for the question-answer task. The results from 2 patients provide independent support of similar work by others with 3 T fMRI, and demonstrate broader clinical utility for these tests at 1.5 T despite lower signal-to-noise ratio. Based on the control results, mental calculation adds a robust imagery task for use in future studies of this kind. ",
pmid_22226599,Structural and functional evaluation of cortical motor areas in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,,"The structural and functional data gathered with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques about the brain cortical motor damage in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) are controversial. In fact some structural MRI studies showed foci of gray matter (GM) atrophy in the precentral gyrus, even in the early stage, while others did not. Most functional MRI (fMRI) studies in ALS reported hyperactivation of extra-primary motor cortices, while contradictory results were obtained on the activation of the primary motor cortex. We aimed to investigate the cortical motor circuitries in ALS patients by a combined structural and functional approach. Twenty patients with definite ALS and 16 healthy subjects underwent a structural examination with acquisition of a 3D T1-weighted sequence and fMRI examination during a maximal force handgrip task executed with the right-hand, the left-hand and with both hands simultaneously. The T1-weighted images were analyzed with Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) that showed several clusters of reduced cortical GM in ALS patients compared to controls including the pre and postcentral gyri, the superior, middle and inferior frontal gyri, the supplementary motor area, the superior and inferior parietal cortices and the temporal lobe, bilaterally but more extensive on the right side. In ALS patients a significant hypoactivation of the primary sensory motor cortex and frontal dorsal premotor areas as compared to controls was observed. The hypoactivated areas matched with foci of cortical atrophy demonstrated by VBM. The fMRI analysis also showed an enhanced activation in the ventral premotor frontal areas and in the parietal cortex pertaining to the fronto-parietal motor circuit which paralleled with disease progression rate and matched with cortical regions of atrophy. The hyperactivation of the fronto-parietal circuit was asymmetric and prevalent in the left hemisphere. VBM and fMRI identified structural and functional markers of an extended cortical damage within the motor circuit of ALS patients. The functional changes in non-primary motor cortices pertaining to fronto-parietal circuit suggest an over-recruitment of a pre-existing physiological sensory-motor network. However, the concomitant fronto-parietal cortical atrophy arises the possibility that such a hyper-activation reflects cortical hyper-excitability due to loss of inhibitory inter-neurons. ",

visuomotor integration","Previous research on reach planning in humans has implicated a frontoparietal network, including the precuneus (PCu), a putative human homolog of the monkey parietal reach region (PRR), and the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd). Using a pro-/anti-reach task, electrophysiological studies in monkeys have demonstrated that the movement goal rather than the location of the visual cue is encoded in PRR and PMd. However, if only the effector but not the movement goal is specified (underspecified condition), the PRR and PMd have been shown to represent all potential movement goals. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we investigated whether the human PCu and PMd likewise encode the movement goal, and whether these reach-related areas also engage in situations with underspecified compared with specified movement goals. By using a pro-/anti-reach task, we spatially dissociated the location of the visual cue from the location of the movement goal. In the specified conditions, pro- and anti-reaches activated similar parietal and premotor areas. In the PCu contralateral to the moving arm, we found directionally selective activation fixed to the movement goal. In the underspecified conditions, we observed activation in reach-related areas of the posterior parietal cortex, including PCu. However, the activation was substantially weaker in parietal areas and lacking in PMd. Our results suggest that human PCu encodes the movement goal rather than the location of the visual cue if the movement goal is specified and even engages in situations when only the visual cue but not the movement goal is defined.

pmid_22475505,"Neural correlates of interference inhibition, action withholding and action cancelation in adult ADHD.",,"Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is marked by inhibitory and attentional deficits which can persist into adulthood. Those deficits have been associated with dysfunctional fronto-striatal and fronto-parietal circuits. The present study sought to delineate neural correlates of component specific inhibitory deficits in adult ADHD using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 20 adult ADHD patients and 24 matched healthy controls were included. Brain activation was assessed during three stages of behavioral inhibition, i.e. interference inhibition (Simon task), action withholding (Go/no-go task) and action cancelation (Stop-signal task). Behaviorally, ADHD patients were affected in all tasks. Impaired interference inhibition was associated with hypoactivation in parietal and medial frontal regions. During action withholding and cancelation ADHD patients displayed hypoactivation in a fronto-striatal network. These findings support the notion of at least two disturbed neural circuits in ADHD differentially associated with deficits in separate inhibitory subcomponents. Thereby, deficits in inhibitory subcomponents which are closely connected to response interference were related to hypofunction in more attention related circuits, while stopping related deficits were rather associated with hypofunction in inhibitory circuits. ",
pmid_22399779,Dissociating modality-specific and supramodal neural systems for action understanding.,,"The neural basis of action understanding in humans remains disputed, with some research implicating the putative mirror neuron system (MNS) and some a mentalizing system (MZS) for inferring mental states. The basis for this dispute may be that action understanding is a heterogeneous construct: actions can be understood from sensory information about body movements or from language about action, and with the goal of understanding the implementation (""how"") or motive (""why"") of an action. Although extant research implicates the MNS in understanding implementation and the MZS in understanding motive, it remains unknown to what extent these systems subserve modality-specific or supramodal functions in action understanding. While undergoing fMRI, 21 volunteers considered the implementation (""How is she doing it?"") and motive (""Why is she doing it?"") for actions presented in video or text. Bilateral parietal and right frontal areas of the MNS showed a modality-specific association with perceiving actions in videos, while left-hemisphere MNS showed a supramodal association with understanding implementation. Largely left-hemisphere MZS showed a supramodal association with understanding motive; however, connectivity among the MZS and MNS during the inference of motive was modality specific, being significantly stronger when motive was understood from actions in videos compared to text. These results support a tripartite model of MNS and MZS contributions to action understanding, where distinct areas of the MNS contribute to action perception (""perceiving what"") and the representation of action implementation (""knowing how""), while the MZS supports an abstract, modality-independent representation of the mental states that explain action performance (""knowing why"").

We examined whether children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) aged 3-7 years preferentially attend to point-light displays depicting biological motion. We found that children with ASD did not preferentially attend to biological motion over phase-scrambled motion, but did preferentially attend to a point-light display of a spinning top rather than a human walker. In contrast a neurotypical matched control group preferentially attended to the human, biological motion in both conditions. The results suggest a core deficit in attending to biological motion in ASD. ",

White matter","Emerging research suggests that antisocial behavior in youth is linked to abnormal brain white matter microstructure, but the extent of such anatomical connectivity abnormalities remain largely untested because previous Conduct Disorder (CD) studies typically have selectively focused on specific frontotemporal tracts. This study aimed to replicate and extend previous frontotemporal diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) findings to determine whether noncomorbid CD adolescents have white matter microstructural abnormalities in major white matter tracts across the whole brain. Seventeen CD-diagnosed adolescents recruited from the community were compared to a group of 24 non-CD youth which did not differ in average age (12-18) or gender proportion. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) measurements were compared between groups using FSL nonparametric two-sample t test, clusterwise whole-brain corrected, p < .05. CD FA and AD deficits were widespread, but unrelated to gender, verbal ability, or CD age of onset. CD adolescents had significantly lower FA and AD values in frontal lobe and temporal lobe regions, including frontal lobe anterior/superior corona radiata, and inferior longitudinal and fronto-occipital fasciculi passing through the temporal lobe. The magnitude of several CD FA deficits was associated with number of CD symptoms. Because AD, but not RD, differed between study groups, abnormalities of axonal microstructure in CD rather than myelination are suggested. This study provides evidence that adolescent antisocial disorder is linked to abnormal white matter microstructure in more than just the uncinate fasciculus as identified in previous DTI studies, or frontotemporal brain structures as suggested by functional neuroimaging studies. Instead, neurobiological risk specific to antisociality in adolescence is linked to microstructural abnormality in numerous long-range white matter connections among many diverse different brain regions.

neuronal correlates","Uncertainty is recognized as an important component in distress, which may elicit impulsive behavior in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). These patients are known to be both impulsive and distress intolerant. The present study explored the connection between outcome uncertainty and impulsivity in BPD. The prediction was that cue primes, which provide incomplete information of subsequent target stimuli, led BPD patients to overrate the predictive value of these cues in order to reduce distress related to outcome uncertainty. This would yield dysfunctional impulsive behavior detected as commission errors to incorrectly primed targets. We hypothesized that dysfunctional impulsivity would be accompanied by aberrant brain activity in the right insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), previously described to be involved in uncertainty processing, attention-/cognitive control and BPD pathology. 14 female BPD patients and 14 healthy matched controls (HCs) for comparison completed a Posner task during fMRI at 3T. The task was modified to limit the effect of spatial orientation and enhance the effect of conscious expectations. Brain activity was monitored in the priming phase where the effects of cue primes and neutral primes were compared. As predicted, the BPD group made significantly more commission errors to incorrectly primed targets than HCs. Also, the patients had faster reaction times to correctly primed targets relative to targets preceded by neutral primes. The BPD group had decreased activity in the right mid insula and increased activity in bilateral dorsal ACC during cue primes. The results indicate that strong expectations induced by cue primes led to reduced uncertainty, increased response readiness, and ultimately, dysfunctional impulsivity in BPD patients. We suggest that outcome uncertainty may be an important component in distress related impulsivity in BPD. ",

Additionally, we wanted to assess whether these structural and functional changes were associated with group differences in pain catastrophizing and migraine-related disease variables in patients. We acquired T1-weighted anatomical and functional magnetic resonance imaging scans during rest in human subjects with a diagnosis of migraine and healthy controls. Structural analyses revealed greater left hippocampal gray matter volume and reduced cortical thickness in the left anterior midcingulate in patients compared with controls. We also observed negative associations between pain catastrophizing and migraine disease variables and gray matter in areas implicated in processing the sensory, affective, and cognitive aspects of pain in patients. Functional connectivity analyses showed that migraine patients displayed disrupted connectivity between default mode, salience, cognitive, visuospatial, and sensorimotor networks, which was associated with group differences in pain catastrophizing and migraine-related disease variables in patients. Together, our findings show widespread morphological and functional brain abnormalities in migraineurs in affective, cognitive, visual, and pain-related brain areas, which are associated with increased pain catastrophizing, disease chronicity, and severity of symptoms, suggesting that these structural and functional changes may be a consequence of repeated, long-term nociceptive signaling leading to increased pain sensitivity, mood disturbances, and maladaptive coping strategies to deal with unrelenting pain.

This study aimed to identify volumetric alterations in a sample of patients with mild alcohol use disorder with a short history of alcohol use, compared with a control group, and also focused on its association with impulsivity levels. Most magnetic resonance imaging studies have focused on severe alcohol use disorder, formerly called alcohol-dependent patients, showing alcohol-related structural alterations and their association with alcohol use history variables but not with personality parameters like impulsivity. Our hypothesis is that our group of alcohol users may already display structural alterations especially in brain regions related to inhibitory control like medial-prefrontal regions, and that those structural alterations could be more associated to personality traits like impulsivity than to drug use variables. Our results clearly demonstrate that our population showed lower regional grey and white matter volumes in the medial-prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices, as well as higher regional white matter volume in the ventral striatum and the internal capsule. Volumetric alterations were associated to the Barratt's impulsivity score: the more impulsive the subjects, the lower the medial-prefrontal cortex grey matter volume. ",

To identify the clinical action of pregabalin, a proven analgesic, the authors performed three complementary brain neuroimaging procedures: (proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging) in 17 chronic pain patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia. The authors found that pregabalin but not placebo reduces combined glutamate + glutamine levels within the posterior insula (pregabalin P = 0.016; placebo P = 0.71). Interestingly, reductions in clinical pain were associated with reductions in brain connectivity of this structure to brain regions within the default mode network during pregabalin (r = 0.82; P = 0.001) but not placebo (r = -0.13; P = 0.63). Response of default mode network regions to experimental pain was also reduced with pregabalin (P = 0.018) but not placebo (P = 0.182). Perhaps most importantly, baseline values for all three neuroimaging markers predicted subsequent analgesic response to pregabalin but not placebo. The results of this study suggest that pregabalin works in part by reducing insular glutamatergic activity, leading to a reduction of the increased functional connectivity seen between brain regions in chronic pain states. The study also supports a role for human brain imaging in the development, assessment, and personalized use of central-acting analgesics. ",
pmid_22008364,Neural recruitment during failed motor inhibition differentiates youths with bipolar disorder and severe mood dysregulation.,,"Controversy exists about whether non-episodic irritability (operationalized as severe mood dysregulation, SMD) should be considered a developmental presentation of pediatric bipolar disorder (BD). While assessments of brain function may address this controversy, only one fMRI study has compared BD versus SMD. We compared neural activation in BD, SMD, and controls during a motor inhibition task, since motor disinhibition is an important clinical feature in both BD and SMD. During failed inhibition, BD youths exhibited less activation in the right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and right nucleus accumbens relative to both SMD and healthy youths. Exploratory analyses indicate that, in BD youths, reduced activation in the right ACC may be independent of comorbid ADHD. These findings highlight neural distinctions between the phenotypically related BD and SMD populations. ",
pmid_24622366,Risk score for prediction of 10 year dementia risk in individuals with type 2 diabetes: a cohort study.,,"Although patients with type 2 diabetes are twice as likely to develop dementia as those without this disease, prediction of who has the highest future risk is difficult. We therefore created and validated a practical summary risk score that can be used to provide an estimate of the 10 year dementia risk for individuals with type 2 diabetes. Using data from two longitudinal cohorts of patients with type 2 diabetes (aged ≥60 years) with 10 years of follow-up, we created (n=29,961) and validated (n=2413) the risk score. We built our prediction model by evaluating 45 candidate predictors using Cox proportional hazard models and developed a point system for the risk score based on the size of the predictor's β coefficient. Model prediction was tested by discrimination and calibration methods. Dementia risk per sum score was calculated with Kaplan-Meier estimates. Microvascular disease, diabetic foot, cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease, acute metabolic events, depression, age, and education were most strongly predictive of dementia and constituted the risk score (C statistic 0·736 for creation cohort and 0·746 for validation cohort). The dementia risk was 5·3% (95% CI 4·2-6·3) for the lowest score (-1) and 73·3% (64·8-81·8) for the highest (12-19) sum scores. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first risk score for the prediction of 10 year dementia risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The risk score can be used to increase vigilance for cognitive deterioration and for selection of high-risk patients for participation in clinical trials.

pmid_15488424,The neural bases of cooperation and competition: an fMRI investigation.,,"Cooperation and competition are two basic modes of social cognition that necessitate monitoring of both one's own and others' actions, as well as adopting a specific mental set. In this fMRI, study individuals played a specially designed computer game, according to a set of predefined rules, either in cooperation with or in competition against another person. The hemodynamic response during these conditions was contrasted to that of the same subjects playing the game independently. Both cooperation and competition stances resulted in activation of a common frontoparietal network subserving executive functions, as well as the anterior insula, involved in autonomic arousal. Moreover, distinct regions were found to be selectively associated with cooperation and competition, notably the orbitofrontal cortex in the former and the inferior parietal and medial prefrontal cortices in the latter. This pattern reflects the different mental frameworks implicated in being cooperative versus competitive with another person. In accordance with evidence from evolutionary psychology as well as from developmental psychology, we argue that cooperation is a socially rewarding process and is associated with specific left medial orbitofrontal cortex involvement.

pmid_27888657,Electroconvulsive Therapy-Induced Brain Structural and Functional Changes in Major Depressive Disorders: A Longitudinal Study.,,"BACKGROUND This study aimed to study the brain structural and functional changes after 8 courses of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) on patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). MATERIAL AND METHODS MRI scans were performed on 12 depressive patients before and after 8 courses of ECT and compared with those of 15 normal controls. Data were analyzed by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) using SPM8 software. Functional MRI (fMRI) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) analyses were used to assess the functional changes after ECT. RESULTS Grey matter volumes were smaller in the right cingulate gyrus of depressive patients before ECT compared with normal controls. After false discovery rate (FDR) correction, post-ECT grey matter volumes were increased in bilateral amygdala and hippocampus compared with pre-ECT. Resting-state ReHo maps showed significant differences in brain activity pre- and post-ECT. Compared with healthy controls, MDD patients treated with 8 courses of ECT showed higher ReHo values in the bilateral frontal lobe, bilateral parietal lobe, and right caudate nucleus. Decreased ReHo values were observed in the right medial temporal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, right cingulate gyrus, and left anterior cerebellar lobe. CONCLUSIONS Results suggested that there were both structural and functional differences between the brains of MDD patients and healthy controls. After ECT, both structural and functional changes occurred, but without complete recovery to normal. ECT may display effects through regulating other brain regions to compensate for the original defects. ",
pmid_27780031,Microstructural brain abnormalities in medication-free patients with major depressive disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis of diffusion tensor imaging.,,"Multiple meta-analyses of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have reported impaired white matter integrity in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, owing to inclusion of medicated patients in these studies, it is difficult to conclude whether these reported alterations are associated with MDD or confounded by medication effects. A meta-analysis of DTI studies on medication-free (medication-naive and medication washout) patients with MDD would therefore be necessary to disentangle MDD-specific effects. We analyzed white matter alterations between medication-free patients with MDD and healthy controls using anisotropic effect size-signed differential mapping (AES-SDM). We used DTI query software for fibre tracking. Both pooled and subgroup meta-analyses in medication washout patients showed robust fractional anisotropy (FA) reductions in white matter of the right cerebellum hemispheric lobule, body of the corpus callosum (CC) and bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus III (SLF III), whereas FA reductions in the genu of the CC and right anterior thalamic projections were seen in only medication-naive patients. Fibre tracking showed that the main tracts with observed FA reductions included the right cerebellar tracts, body of the CC, bilateral SLF III and arcuate fascicle. The analytic techniques, patient characteristics and clinical variables of the included studies were heterogeneous; we could not exclude the effects of nondrug therapies owing to a lack of data. By excluding the confounding influences of current medication status, findings from the present study may provide a better understanding of the underlying neuropathology of MDD. ",

resting-state fMRI","Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is thought to be useful for chronic pain, with the pathology of the latter being closely associated with cognitive-emotional components. However, there are few resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) studies. We used the independent component analysis method to examine neural changes after CBT and to assess whether brain regions predict treatment response. We performed R-fMRI on a group of 29 chronic pain (somatoform pain disorder) patients and 30 age-matched healthy controls (T1). Patients were enrolled in a weekly 12-session group CBT (T2). We assessed selected regions of interest that exhibited differences in intrinsic connectivity network (ICN) connectivity strength between the patients and controls at T1, and compared T1 and T2. We also examined the correlations between treatment effects and rs-fMRI data. Abnormal ICN connectivity of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and inferior parietal lobule within the dorsal attention network (DAN) and of the paracentral lobule within the sensorimotor network in patients with chronic pain normalized after CBT. Higher ICN connectivity strength in the OFC indicated greater improvements in pain intensity. Furthermore, ICN connectivity strength in the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) within the DAN at T1 was negatively correlated with CBT-related clinical improvements. We conclude that the OFC is crucial for CBT-related improvement of pain intensity, and that the dorsal PCC activation at pretreatment also plays an important role in improvement of clinical symptoms via CBT.

Gray matter
Superior temporal sulcus
Voxel-based morphometry","Because the disruptive behavior disorders are highly impairing conditions, it is important to determine if structural variations in brain are associated early in life with these problems among children. Structural MRI data were acquired from 111 9-11 year olds (58 girls and 53 boys), 43 who met diagnostic criteria for oppositional defiant disorder and/or conduct disorder and 68 healthy controls. Voxel-based morphometry was used to examine associations of behavioral measures with gray matter volumes in whole-brain analyses. Unlike previous studies, variation in gray matter volume was not found to be associated with a disruptive behavior disorder diagnosis in any brain region at p < .05 with FWE correction. Nonetheless, an inverse nonlinear association of the number of conduct disorder (CD) symptoms with gray matter volume along the left superior temporal sulcus was significant in the full sample (p < .05 with FWE correction), with a trend in the right hemisphere (p < 0.001 uncorrected). There also was a trend toward a stronger association of the number of CD symptoms with gray matter volume along the left superior temporal sulcus in girls than boys. The present findings did not replicate previous findings of reduced gray matter volumes in the anterior insula, amygdala, and frontal cortex in youth with CD, but are consistent with previous findings of reduced gray matter volumes in temporal regions, particularly in girls.

While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during MI and ME reveals shared cortical representations, the role and functional relevance of the resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of brain regions involved in MI is yet unknown. Here, we performed resting-state fMRI followed by fMRI during ME and MI with the dominant hand. We used a behavioral chronometry test to measure ME and MI movement duration and compute an index of performance (IP). Then, we analyzed the voxel-matched correlation between the individual MI parameter estimates and seed-based RSFC maps in the MI network to measure the correspondence between RSFC and MI fMRI activation. We found that inter-individual differences in intrinsic connectivity in the MI network predicted several clusters of activation. Taken together, present findings provide first evidence that RSFC within the MI network is predictive of the activation of MI brain regions, including those associated with behavioral performance, thus suggesting a role for RSFC in obtaining a deeper understanding of neural substrates of MI and of MI ability.

pmid_24169638,"Fear conditioning, persistence of disruptive behavior and psychopathic traits: an fMRI study.",,"Children diagnosed with Disruptive Behavior Disorders (DBD), especially those with psychopathic traits, are at risk of developing persistent and severe antisocial behavior. Deficient fear conditioning may be a key mechanism underlying persistence, and has been associated with altered regional brain function in adult antisocial populations. In this study, we investigated the associations between the neural correlates of fear conditioning, persistence of childhood-onset DBD during adolescence and psychopathic traits. From a cohort of children arrested before the age of 12 years, participants who were diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder or Conduct Disorder in previous waves (mean age of onset 6.5 years, s.d. 3.2) were reassessed at mean age 17.6 years (s.d. 1.4) and categorized as persistent (n=25) or desistent (n=25) DBD. Using the Youth Psychopathic Traits Inventory and functional magnetic resonance imaging during a fear conditioning task, these subgroups were compared with 26 matched healthy controls from the same cohort. Both persistent and desistent DBD subgroups were found to show higher activation in fear processing-related brain areas during fear conditioning compared with healthy controls. In addition, regression analyses revealed that impulsive-irresponsible and grandiose-manipulative psychopathic traits were associated with higher activation, whereas callous-unemotional psychopathic traits were related to lower activation in fear-related areas. Finally, the association between neural activation and DBD subgroup membership was mediated by impulsive-irresponsible psychopathic traits. These results provide evidence for heterogeneity in the neurobiological mechanisms underlying psychopathic traits and antisocial behavior and, as such, underscore the need to develop personalized interventions.

Negative stimulus","Although the effects of cognitive reappraisal in regulating negative emotion are generally well documented, its regulatory effects are usually not very strong because the ordinary reappraisals employed in previous studies were insufficient to overcome the mental set or response bias toward negative situations. In this study, we developed a new strategy employing creative reappraisals that provides an insightful reinterpretation of the negative stimulus. We believe this approach, through adopting a guided (creative) reappraisal rather than self-generation strategy, will greatly improve the emotion regulation effect of reappraisal through activating the neural networks representing the process of deep and structural mental representational change accompanied by the feeling of positive emotion and mental reward. The behavioral results suggested that 1) regarding the transient regulatory effect, creative reappraisal resulted in a positive rating for standardized negative pictures; 2) creative reappraisal had a long-lasting effect in reducing negative affect. In parallel with these behavioral results, the imaging data indicated that 1) creative reappraisal was specifically associated with greater engagement of the amygdala and hippocampus as well as regions in the ventral striatum, and 2) the engagement of the amygdala predicted the transient regulatory effect of creative reappraisal, while the involvement of the hippocampus and the ventral striatum predicted long-term regulatory effects. These findings suggest that the superior regulatory effect of creative reappraisal could be mediated by amygdala-based salient emotional arousal, hippocampus-based new association formation, and striatum-based mental rewarding to lead to a novel and positive experience that could be kept in long-term memory. This research indicates the key role of creative insight in reappraisal and presents a novel and highly efficient reappraisal strategy. ",
pmid_23711773,Altered brain activity in severely obese women may recover after Roux-en Y gastric bypass surgery.,,"Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated alterations in brain activity in obese (OB) subjects that might be causally linked to their disorder. Roux-en Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery induces a marked and sustained weight loss and may affect brain activity. The aim of this study was to compare brain activity pattern between severely OB women (n=11), normal-weight women (NW, n=11) and previously severely OB women who had undergone RYGB surgery (RYGB, n=9) on average 3.4±0.8 years (all >1 year) before the experiment. Brain activity was assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging during a one-back task containing food- and non-food-related pictures and during resting state. Hunger and satiety were repeatedly rated on a visual analog scale during the experiment. As compared with NW and also with RYGB women, OB women showed (1) a higher cerebellar and a lower fusiform gyrus activity during the visual stimulation independently of the picture category, (2) a higher hypothalamic activation during the presentation of low- vs high-caloric food pictures, (3) a higher hippocampal and cerebellar activity during the working memory task and (4) a stronger functional connectivity in frontal regions of the default mode network during resting state. There were no differences in brain activity between the NW and RYGB women, both during picture presentation and during resting state. RYGB women generally rated lower on hunger and higher on satiety, whereas there were no differences in these ratings between the OB and NW women. Data provide evidence for an altered brain activity pattern in severely OB women and suggest that RYGB surgery and/or the surgically induced weight loss reverses the obesity-associated alterations.

pmid_15246969,Absence of increasing cortical fMRI activity volume in response to increasing visceral stimulation in IBS patients.,,"Cerebral cortical activity associated with perceived visceral sensation represents registration of afferent transduction and cognitive processes related to perception. Abnormalities of gut sensory function can involve either or both of these processes. Cortical registration of subliminal viscerosensory signals represents cerebral cortical activity induced by stimulation of intestinal sensory neurocircuitry without the influence of perception-related cortical activity, whereas those associated with perception represent both neural circuitry and cognitive processes. Our aims were to determine and compare quantitatively cerebral cortical functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity in response to subliminal, liminal, and nonpainful supraliminal rectal distension between a group of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients and age/gender-matched controls. Eight female IBS patients and eight age-matched healthy female control subjects were studied using brain fMRI techniques. Three barostat-controlled distension levels were tested: 1) 10 mmHg below perception (subliminal), 2) at perception (liminal), and 3) 10 mmHg above perception (supraliminal). In control subjects, there was a direct relationship between stimulus intensity and cortical activity volumes, ie., the volume of fMRI cortical activity in response to subliminal (3,226 +/- 335 microl), liminal (5,751 +/- 396 microl), and supraliminal nonpainful stimulation (8,246 +/- 624 microl) were significantly different (P < 0.05). In contrast, in IBS patients this relationship was absent and fMRI activity volumes for subliminal (2,985 +/- 332 microl), liminal (2,457 +/- 342 microl), and supraliminal nonpainful stimulation (2,493 +/- 351 microl) were similar. Additional recruitment of cortical fMRI activity volume in response to increasing stimulation from subliminal to liminal and supraliminal domains is absent in IBS patients, suggesting a difference in the processing of perceived stimulation compared with controls.

pmid_15546700,Differences of cerebral activation between superior and inferior learners during motor sequence encoding and retrieval.,,"Cerebral activation during memory encoding and retrieval might depend on subjects' learning capacity, either by corresponding to better performance in superior learners or by reflecting increased effort in inferior learners. To investigate these alternative hypotheses, the study compared cerebral activation during encoding and retrieval of a motor sequence in groups of subjects with superior and inferior learning performances. Ten healthy subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a motor sequence encoding paradigm (i.e. finger tapping sequence) and a retrieval paradigm (i.e. reproduction of the learned sequence). Subjects were divided into superior and inferior learners according to the correctness of sequence reproduction during retrieval. During encoding, there was strong bilateral activation in the middle frontal gyrus, the supplementary motor area (SMA), the lateral parietal lobe and the cerebellum. During retrieval, again strong activation was found in identical areas of the prefrontal cortex, the parietal lobe and the cerebellum. During encoding, inferior learners showed more left-sided activations in the left middle frontal and inferior parietal gyri. Superior learners showed increased activation in the corresponding right-sided brain areas during encoding as well as during retrieval. Differences of cerebral activations in the prefrontal and parietal cortex during encoding and retrieval were found to be related to retrieval performance, i.e. success and effort. Further intervention studies are needed to assess whether these interindividual differences are the cause or the consequence of differences in memory performance. ",
pmid_12628177,The well-worn route and the path less traveled: distinct neural bases of route following and wayfinding in humans.,,"Finding one's way in a large-scale environment may engage different cognitive processes than following a familiar route. The neural bases of these processes were investigated using functional MRI (fMRI). Subjects found their way in one virtual-reality town and followed a well-learned route in another. In a control condition, subjects followed a visible trail. Within subjects, accurate wayfinding activated the right posterior hippocampus. Between-subjects correlations with performance showed that good navigators (i.e., accurate wayfinders) activated the anterior hippocampus during wayfinding and head of caudate during route following. These results coincide with neurophysiological evidence for distinct response (caudate) and place (hippocampal) representations supporting navigation. We argue that the type of representation used influences both performance and concomitant fMRI activation patterns. ",

We recruited 75 subjects with IGD, 75 without IGD, and 75 in remission from IGD based on the Diagnostic Criteria of Internet Addiction for College Students (DC-IA-C). All participants underwent a diagnostic interview based on the diagnostic criteria of IGD in the DSM-5 and completed the CIAS and QGU-B. Except for the ""deceiving"" and ""escape"" criteria, all criteria of IGD had diagnostic accuracy ranging from 77.3% to 94.7% to differentiate university students with IGD from remitted students. The criterion of craving had diagnostic accuracy of 88% and the criteria of irritability had an accuracy of 68.7%. Fulfilling 5 or more criteria of IGD in the DSM-5 was the best cut-off point to differentiate young adults with IGD from healthy or remitted users. ",

pmid_19195646,Reward feedback alterations in unmedicated schizophrenia patients: relevance for delusions.,,"Increased attribution of incentive salience to neutral or aversive stimuli might be associated with dysfunction of neuronal processing of positive and negative reinforcement and contribute to the formation of delusions in schizophrenia. Fifteen unmedicated patients with schizophrenia (8 drug-naive and 7 drug-free for at least 3 months) and 15 age- and gender-matched healthy control participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate neural responses to feedback of (successful vs. unsuccessful) monetary gain or avoidance of loss. Functional connectivity was assessed between the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and ventral striatum (VS), brain areas known to be activated by feedback of reward and loss. Responses to negative outcome in reward trials (omission of expected reward) were exaggerated in the MPFC of patients with schizophrenia. In contrast, schizophrenia patients showed reduced neural responses to successful versus unsuccessful avoidance of loss in the VS. Increased severity of delusions in schizophrenia patients was associated with a decrease in MPFC activation elicited by successful versus unsuccessful avoidance of loss. Functional connectivity between the MPFC and the VS was reduced in patients with schizophrenia compared with healthy control subjects. These findings demonstrate a differential impairment of-and reduced connectivity between--VS and MPFC during processing of reward and loss-avoidance in drug-free patients with schizophrenia. Moreover, our results provide a link between the formation of delusions and the neural processing of aversive outcomes. ",

The aim of this review was to report the neural responses to visual food cues, as assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in humans of differing weight status. Published studies to 2014 were retrieved and included if they used visual food cues, studied humans >18 years old, reported weight status, and included fMRI outcomes. Sixty studies were identified that investigated the neural responses of healthy weight participants (n = 26), healthy weight compared to obese participants (n = 17), and weight-loss interventions (n = 12). High-calorie food images were used in the majority of studies (n = 36), however, image selection justification was only provided in 19 studies. Obese individuals had increased activation of reward-related brain areas including the insula and orbitofrontal cortex in response to visual food cues compared to healthy weight individuals, and this was particularly evident in response to energy dense cues. Additionally, obese individuals were more responsive to food images when satiated. Meta-analysis of changes in neural activation post-weight loss revealed small areas of convergence across studies in brain areas related to emotion, memory, and learning, including the cingulate gyrus, lentiform nucleus, and precuneus. Differential activation patterns to visual food cues were observed between obese, healthy weight, and weight-loss populations. Future studies require standardization of nutrition variables and fMRI outcomes to enable more direct comparisons between studies. ",

To our knowledge, no meta-analysis has investigated regional homogeneity changes in medication-free patients with MDD. Moreover, an association between regional homogeneity and rCBF has been demonstrated in some brain regions in healthy controls. We sought to explore to what extent resting-state rCBF and regional homogeneity changes co-occur in the depressed brain without the potential confound of medication. Using the effect-size signed differential mapping method, we conducted 2 meta-analyses of rCBF and regional homogeneity studies of medication-free patients with MDD. Our systematic search identified 14 rCBF studies and 9 regional homogeneity studies. We identified conjoint decreases in resting-state rCBF and regional homogeneity in the insula and superior temporal gyrus in medication-free patients with MDD compared with controls. Other changes included altered resting-state rCBF in the precuneus and in the frontal-limbic-thalamic-striatal neural circuit as well as altered regional homogeneity in the uncus and parahippocampal gyrus. Meta-regression revealed that the percentage of female patients with MDD was negatively associated with resting-state rCBF in the right anterior cingulate cortex and that the age of patients with MDD was negatively associated with rCBF in the left insula and with regional homogeneity in the left uncus. The analysis techniques, patient characteristics and clinical variables of the included studies were heterogeneous. The conjoint alterations of rCBF and regional homogeneity in the insula and superior temporal gyrus may be core neuropathological changes in medication-free patients with MDD and serve as a specific region of interest for further studies on MDD.

The homeostatic regulation of food intake is critically dependent on top-down control of reward-driven food craving. There is accumulating evidence from animal studies that the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) is involved in regulating hunger states and eating behavior, but whether OXT also contributes to cognitive control of food craving in humans is still unclear. We conducted a counter-balanced, double-blind, within-subject, pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging experiment involving 31 healthy women who received 24 IU of intranasal OXT or placebo and were scanned twice while they were exposed to pictures of palatable food. The participants were instructed either to imagine the immediate consumption or to cognitively control the urge to eat the food. Our results show a trend that OXT specifically reduced food craving in the cognitive control condition. On the neural level, these findings were paralleled by an increase of activity in the middle and superior frontal gyrus, precuneus, and cingulate cortex under OXT. Interestingly, the behavioral OXT effect correlated with the OXT-induced changes in the prefrontal cortex and precuneus. Collectively, the present study provides first evidence that OXT plays a key role in the cognitive regulation of food craving in women by strengthening activity in a broad neurocircuitry implicated in top-down control and self-referential processing.

It disrupts all components of a visually guided prehension movement, not only the transport of the hand toward an object's location, but also the in-flight finger movements pretailored to the metric properties of the object. Like previous cases, our patient (I.G.) was quite unable to open her handgrip appropriately when directly reaching out to pick up objects of different sizes. When first tested, she failed to do this even when she had previewed the target object 5 s earlier. Yet despite this deficit in ""real"" grasping, we found, counterintuitively, that I.G. showed good grip scaling when ""pantomiming"" a grasp for an object seen earlier but no longer present. We then found that, after practice, I.G. became able to scale her handgrip when grasping a real target object that she had previewed earlier. By interposing catch trials in which a different object was covertly substituted for the original object during the delay between preview and grasp, we found that I.G. was now using memorized visual information to calibrate her real grasping movements. These results provide new evidence that ""off-line"" visuomotor guidance can be provided by networks independent of the PPC. ",

In an attempt to further our understanding of the neural basis of delusions, we explored gray matter deficits and their clinical associations in first-episode schizophrenia patients with and without delusions. Twenty-four first-episode schizophrenia patients with delusions and 18 without delusions as well as 26 healthy controls (HC) underwent clinical assessment and whole-brain structural imaging which were acquired a 3.0 T scanner. Voxel-based morphometry was used to explore inter-group differences in gray matter volume using analysis of covariance, and Spearman correlation coefficients (rho) between the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS)-delusion scores and mean regional brain volumes was obtained. Patients with delusions showed decreased brain gray matter volumes in the left putamen, thalamus, and caudate regions compared with HC. Patients with delusions also showed decreased regional volume in the left putamen and thalamus compared with patients without delusions. SAPS-delusion scores were negatively correlated with the gray matter volumes of the left putamen and thalamus. Left putamen and thalamus volume loss may be biological correlates of delusions in schizophrenia. ",
pmid_28375207,Deficit of state-dependent risk attitude modulation in gambling disorder.,,"Gambling disorder (GD) is often considered as a problem of trait-like risk preference. However, the symptoms of GD cannot be fully understood by this trait view. In the present study, we hypothesized that GD patients also had problem with a flexible control of risk attitude (state-dependent strategy optimization), and aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying abnormal risk-taking of GD. To address this issue, we tested GD patients without comorbidity (GD group: n=21) and age-matched healthy control participants (HC group: n=29) in a multi-step gambling task, in which participants needed to clear 'block quota' (required units to clear a block, 1000-7000 units) in 20 choices, and conducted a task-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment. Behavioral analysis indeed revealed a less flexible risk-attitude change in the GD group; the GD group failed to avoid risky choice in a specific quota range (low-quota condition), in which risky strategy was not optimal to solve the quota. Accordingly, fMRI analysis highlighted diminished functioning of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), which has been heavily implicated in cognitive flexibility. To our knowledge, the present study provided the first empirical evidence of a deficit of state-dependent strategy optimization in GD. Focusing on flexible control of risk attitude under quota may contribute to a better understanding of the psychopathology of GDs. ",
pmid_24915066,Effects of long-term acupuncture treatment on resting-state brain activity in migraine patients: a randomized controlled trial on active acupoints and inactive acupoints.,,"Acupuncture has been commonly used for preventing migraine attacks and relieving pain during a migraine, although there is limited knowledge on the physiological mechanism behind this method. The objectives of this study were to compare the differences in brain activities evoked by active acupoints and inactive acupoints and to investigate the possible correlation between clinical variables and brain responses. A randomized controlled trial and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were conducted. A total of eighty migraineurs without aura were enrolled to receive either active acupoint acupuncture or inactive acupoint acupuncture treatment for 8 weeks, and twenty patients in each group were randomly selected for the fMRI scan at the end of baseline and at the end of treatment. The neuroimaging data indicated that long-term active acupoint therapy elicited a more extensive and remarkable cerebral response compared with acupuncture at inactive acupoints. Most of the regions were involved in the pain matrix, lateral pain system, medial pain system, default mode network, and cognitive components of pain processing. Correlation analysis showed that the decrease in the visual analogue scale (VAS) was significantly related to the increased average Regional homogeneity (ReHo) values in the anterior cingulate cortex in the two groups. Moreover, the decrease in the VAS was associated with increased average ReHo values in the insula which could be detected in the active acupoint group. Long-term active acupoint therapy and inactive acupoint therapy have different brain activities. We postulate that acupuncture at the active acupoint might have the potential effect of regulating some disease-affected key regions and the pain circuitry for migraine, and promote establishing psychophysical pain homeostasis.

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
Visual cortex","Migraine is a common neurological disease that is often accompanied by psychiatric comorbidities. However, the relationship between abnormal brain function and psychiatric comorbidities in migraine patients remains largely unclear. Therefore, the present study sought to explore the correlations between the resting-state functional deficits and psychiatric comorbidities in migraine without aura (MwoA) patients. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance images were obtained. In addition, the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) values were obtained. Thereafter regional abnormalities in MwoA patients with and without anxiety (MwoA-A and MwoA-OA) were chosen as seeds to conduct functional connectivity (FC) analysis. Compared to the healthy controls (HCs), the MwoA-A and MwoA-OA patients had abnormal ALFF and ReHo values in the right lingual gyrus (LG). They also had abnormal FC of the right LG with the ipsilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and middle cingulate cortex (MCC). Additionally, the MwoA-A patients showed higher ReHo values in the left posterior intraparietal sulcus (pIPS) and abnormal FC of the right LG with ipsilateral pIPS and primary visual cortex, compared to the MwoA-OA patients. Moreover, the MwoA-OA patients showed an increase in the FC with the right posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCUN), left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and left inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) relative to the HCs. Furthermore, the ALFF values of the right LG positively were correlated with anxiety scores in MwoA-A patients. The abnormal LG-related FCs with the PCC/PCUN, MFG and ITG were negatively associated with the frequency of headaches in MwoA-OA patients. This study identified abnormal visual FC along with other core networks differentiating anxiety comorbidity from MwoA. This may therefore enhance the understanding of the neuropsychological basis of psychiatric comorbidities and provide novel insights that may help in the discovery of new marks or even treatment targets.

Though AD has been studied for more than 100 years since 1906, the exact cause(s) and pathogenic mechanism(s) remain to be clarified. Also, the efficient disease-modifying treatment and ideal diagnostic method for AD are unavailable. Perturbed cerebral glucose metabolism, an invariant pathophysiological feature of AD, may be a critical contributor to the pathogenesis of this disease. In this review, we firstly discussed the features of cerebral glucose metabolism in physiological and pathological conditions. Then, we further reviewed the contribution of glucose transportation abnormality and intracellular glucose catabolism dysfunction in AD pathophysiology, and proposed a hypothesis that multiple pathogenic cascades induced by impaired cerebral glucose metabolism could result in neuronal degeneration and consequently cognitive deficits in AD patients. Among these pathogenic processes, altered functional status of thiamine metabolism and brain insulin resistance are highly emphasized and characterized as major pathogenic mechanisms. Finally, considering the fact that AD patients exhibit cerebral glucose hypometabolism possibly due to impairments of insulin signaling and altered thiamine metabolism, we also discuss some potential possibilities to uncover diagnostic biomarkers for AD from abnormal glucose metabolism and to develop drugs targeting at repairing insulin signaling impairment and correcting thiamine metabolism abnormality. We conclude that glucose metabolism abnormality plays a critical role in AD pathophysiological alterations through the induction of multiple pathogenic factors such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and so forth. To clarify the causes, pathogeneses and consequences of cerebral hypometabolism in AD will help break the bottleneck of current AD study in finding ideal diagnostic biomarker and disease-modifying therapy.

voxel-based morphometry","Numerous neuroimaging studies have revealed structural brain abnormalities in schizophrenia patients. There is emerging evidence that dysfunctional nerve growth factor (NGF) signaling may contribute to structural brain alterations found in these patients. In this pilot study, we investigated whether there was a correlation between NGF serum levels and gray matter volume (GMV) in schizophrenia patients. Further, we investigated whether there was an overlap between the correlative findings and cross-sectional GMV differences between schizophrenia patients (n = 18) and healthy controls (n = 19). Serum NGF was significantly correlated to GMV in the left prefrontal lobe, the left midcingulate cortex, and the brainstem in schizophrenia patients. However, we did not find any correlations of NGF serum levels with GMV in healthy controls. Schizophrenia patients showed smaller GMV than healthy controls in brain regions located in the bilateral limbic system, bilateral parietal lobe, bilateral insula, bilateral primary auditory cortex, left frontal lobe, and bilateral occipital regions. In a conjunction analysis, GMV in the left midcingulate cortex (MCC) appears negatively correlated to NGF serum levels in the group of schizophrenia patients and also to be reduced compared to healthy controls. These results suggest an increased vulnerability of schizophrenia patients to changes in NGF levels compared to healthy controls and support a role for NGF signaling in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. As our pilot study is exploratory in nature, further studies enrolling larger sample sizes will be needed to further corroborate our findings and to investigate the influence of additional covariates.

However, it remains unclear whether the frequency-dependent pattern of ALFF alterations can effectively distinguish the different phases of the disease. In the present study, 52 AD and 50 aMCI patients were enrolled together with 43 NC in total. The ALFF values were calculated in the following three frequency bands: classical (0.01-0.08 Hz), slow-4 (0.027-0.073 Hz) and slow-5 (0.01-0.027 Hz) for the three different groups. Subsequently, the local functional abnormalities were employed as features to examine the effect of classification among AD, aMCI and NC using a support vector machine (SVM). We found that the among-group differences of ALFF in the different frequency bands were mainly located in the left hippocampus (HP), right HP, bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and bilateral precuneus (PCu), left angular gyrus (AG) and left medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). When the local functional abnormalities were employed as features, we identified that the ALFF in the slow-5 frequency band showed the highest accuracy to distinguish among the three groups. These findings may deepen our understanding of the pathogenesis of AD and suggest that slow-5 frequency band may be helpful to explore the pathogenesis and distinguish the phases of this disease. ",
pmid_22916152,Effect of acupuncture in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease: a functional MRI study.,,"We aim to clarify the mechanisms of acupuncture in treating mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD) by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Thirty-six right-handed subjects (8 MCI patients, 14 AD patients, and 14 healthy elders) participated in this study. Clinical and neuropsychological examinations were performed on all the subjects. MRI data acquisition was performed on a SIEMENS verio 3-Tesla scanner. The fMRI study used a single block experimental design. We first acquired the baseline resting state data in the initial 3 minutes; we then acquired the fMRI data during the procession of acupuncture stimulation on the acupoints of Tai chong and Hegu for the following 3 minutes. Last, we acquired fMRI data for another 10 minutes after the needle was withdrawn. The preprocessing and data analysis were performed using the statistical parametric mapping (SPM8) software. Then the two-sample t-tests were performed between each two groups of different states. We found that during the resting state, brain activities in AD and MCI patients were different from those of control subjects. During the acupuncture and the second resting state after acupuncture, when comparing to resting state, there are several regions showing increased or decreased activities in MCI, AD subjects compared to normal subjects. Most of the regions were involved in the temporal lobe and the frontal lobe, which were closely related to the memory and cognition. In conclusion, we investigated the effect of acupuncture in AD and MCI patients by combing fMRI and traditional acupuncture. Our fMRI study confirmed that acupuncture at Tai chong (Liv3) and He gu (LI4) can activate certain cognitive-related regions in AD and MCI patients. ",

Schizophrenia","Lack of normal asymmetry in the brain has been reported in patients with schizophrenia. However, it remains unclear whether disrupted asymmetry originates from inter-hemispheric functional connectivity (FC) and/or intra-hemispheric FC in this patient population. Forty-four patients with drug-naive, first-episode schizophrenia, 42 unaffected siblings, and 44 healthy controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan. The parameter of asymmetry (PAS) and support vector machine (SVM) were used to analyze the data. Patients were treated with olanzapine for 8 weeks. Compared with healthy controls, patients showed lower PAS scores in the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG)/inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus and left angular gyrus, and higher PAS scores in the left precentral gyrus/postcentral gyrus. Unaffected siblings also showed lower PAS scores in the left MTG/ITG and left PCC/precuneus relative to healthy controls. Further, SVM analysis showed that a combination of the PAS scores in these two clusters in patients at baseline was able to predict clinical response after 8 weeks of olanzapine treatment with 77.27% sensitivity, 72.73% specificity, and 75.00% accuracy. The present study suggests disrupted asymmetry of inter- and intra-hemispheric FC in drug-naive, first-episode schizophrenia; in addition, a reduced asymmetry of inter-hemispheric FC in the left MTG/ITG and left PCC/precuneus may serve as an endophenotype for schizophrenia, and may have clinical utility to predict response to olanzapine treatment.

This study uses resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine attention network alterations in T2DM and their relationships to impaired cognitive performance. Data-driven independent component analysis was applied to resting-state fMRI data from 38 T2DM patients and 32 healthy controls to identify the dorsal attention network (DAN) and ventral attention network (VAN). Correlations were then determined among the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC), clinical data, and neuropsychological scores. The T2DM patients exhibited decreased rsFC in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and bilateral inferior parietal lobe (IPL) of the DAN, as well as the left IPL and right MFG/IFG of the VAN. In addition, the rsFC of the left MFG was inversely correlated with the Trail Making Test-B scores; the rsFC of the left IPL was positively correlated with the Digit Span Test scores but negatively correlated with HbA1c; and the rsFC in the right precuneus was positively associated with cognitive performance (without Bonferroni correction). In conclusion, T2DM affects resting-state attentional networks, which may be related to reduced attention and a hyperglycemic state. ",

pmid_18586110,Neurodevelopmental changes in verbal working memory load-dependency: an fMRI investigation.,,"Development of working memory (WM) aptitude parallels structural changes in the frontal-parietal association cortices important for performance within this cognitive domain. The cerebellum has been proposed to function in support of the postulated phonological loop component of verbal WM, and along with frontal and parietal cortices, has been shown to exhibit linear WM load-dependent activation in adults. It is not known if these kinds of WM load-dependent relationships exist for cerebro-cerebellar networks in developmental populations, and whether there are age-related changes in the nature of load-dependency between childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. The present study used fMRI and a verbal Sternberg WM task with three load levels to investigate developmental changes in WM load-dependent cerebro-cerebellar activation in a sample of 30 children, adolescents, and young adults between the ages of 7 and 28. The neural substrates of linear load-dependency were found to change with age. Among adolescents and adults, frontal, parietal and cerebellar regions showed linear load-dependency, or increasing activation under conditions of increasing WM load. In contrast, children recruited only left ventral prefrontal cortex in response to increasing WM load. These results demonstrate that, while children, adolescents, and young adults activate similar cerebro-cerebellar verbal working memory networks, the extent to which they rely on parietal and cerebellar regions in response to increasing task difficulty changes significantly between childhood and adolescence.

pmid_22024484,Neural correlates of cognitive flexibility in children at risk for bipolar disorder.,,"Youth with bipolar disorder (BD) show behavioral and neural deficits in cognitive flexibility; however, whether such deficits exist among youths at risk for BD has not been explored. The current fMRI study examined the neural basis of cognitive flexibility in BD youth (n = 28), unaffected youth at risk for BD (AR; n = 13), and healthy volunteer youth (HV; n = 21) by comparing brain activation patterns while participants performed the change task. On change trials, subjects must inhibit a prepotent response and execute an alternate one. During successful change trials, both BD and AR youth had increased right ventrolateral prefrontal and inferior parietal activity, compared to HV youth. During failed change trials, both BD and AR youth exhibited increased caudate activation relative to HV youth, but BD youth showed increased activation in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) relative to the other two groups. Abnormal activity in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal cortex, and striatum during a cognitive flexibility task may represent a potential BD endophenotype, but subgenual ACC dysfunction may represent a marker of BD illness itself.

This study used voxel based morphometry and applied an a priori region of interest approach based on our previous work, as well as from well-developed neuroanatomical theories of ADHD. Seventy-four adults with DSM-IV ADHD and 54 healthy control subjects comparable on age, sex, race, handedness, IQ, reading achievement, frequency of learning disabilities, and whole brain volume had an MRI on a 1.5T Siemens scanner. A priori region of interest hypotheses focused on reduced volumes in ADHD in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, caudate, putamen, inferior parietal lobule, and cerebellum. Analyses were carried out by FSL-VBM 1.1. Relative to control subjects, ADHD adults had significantly smaller gray matter volumes in parts of six of these regions at p ≤ .01, whereas parts of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal lobule were significantly larger in ADHD at this threshold. However, a number of other regions were smaller and larger in ADHD (especially fronto-orbital cortex) at this threshold. Only the caudate remained significantly smaller at the family-wise error rate. Adults with ADHD have subtle volume reductions in the caudate and possibly other brain regions involved in attention and executive control supporting frontostriatal models of ADHD. Modest group brain volume differences are discussed in the context of the nature of the samples studied and voxel based morphometry methodology. ",
pmid_16095920,A special role for numbers in working memory? An fMRI study.,,"Although numbers carry averbal semantics (i.e., magnitude), they are often utilized in verbal Working Memory (vWM) tasks. However, vWM is thought to rely on a purely phonological code. Here, we tested the influence of (a) averbal semantics and (b) different tasks on performance in a vWM context by examining stimulus and task-specific variation of activity in the horizontal parts of the intraparietal sulcus (hIPS). The hIPS has previously been shown to subserve magnitude processing modulated by (a) specific stimuli and (b) specific tasks. Two variants of an n-back paradigm (comparison and identity match tasks) utilizing letters and numbers as stimulus material at different levels of vWM load were administered in 16 participants. Behavioral and functional imaging data reveal stimulus-specific modulation of activity in the hIPS suggesting a semantic influence of numbers. In the identity match task, numbers induced additional hIPS activation compared to letters while letters never induced additional hIPS activation when compared to numbers. Letters as compared to numbers only induced additional hIPS activation in the comparison task. These results question the assumption of a purely phonological code in vWM because hIPS activation subserving magnitude processing is modulated by stimulus semantics and task demands. ",

The neural substrate has been examined following treatment with antidepressant medication but not with psychological therapies. The present study investigated the neural correlates of implicit processing of sad facial expressions in depression pretreatment and posttreatment with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The patient group consisted of 16 medication-free subjects (mean age 40 years) with a DSM-IV diagnosis of acute unipolar major depression, and the comparison group were 16 matched healthy volunteers. Subjects participated in a prospective study with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at weeks 0 and 16. During the fMRI scans, subjects performed an affect recognition task with facial stimuli morphed to display varying intensities of sadness. Patients received 16 sessions of CBT. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were analyzed for the mean activation and differential response to variable intensity (load-response) of facial affect processing. During an acute depressive episode, patients showed elevated amygdala-hippocampal activity relative to healthy individuals. Baseline dorsal anterior cingulate activity in patients showed a significant relationship with subsequent clinical response. These data provide further support for elevated amygdala activity in depression and suggest that anterior cingulate activity may be a predictor of treatment response to both pharmacotherapy and CBT.

A total of 47 patients with PDM were randomly assigned to the verum acupuncture group and sham acupuncture group with three menstrual cycles of the acupuncture course. The fMRI scans, visual analog scale (VAS) scores, and other clinical evaluations were assessed at baseline and after three menstrual-cycles treatments. The global functional connectivity density (gFCD) analyses were performed between the pre-and post-acupuncture course of two groups at full-low frequency band, Slow-3 band, Slow-4 band, and Slow-5 band. After the acupuncture treatments, the patients with PDM in the verum acupuncture group showed significantly decreased VAS scores ( These findings supported that verum acupuncture could effectively modulate frequency-dependent gFCD in PDM by influencing abnormal DLPFC at Slow-5 band and hippocampus at the Slow-3 band. The outcome of this study may shed light on enhancing the potency of acupuncture in clinical practice. ",
pmid_19357338,Visuospatial working memory capacity predicts the organization of acquired explicit motor sequences.,,"Studies have suggested that cognitive processes such as working memory and temporal control contribute to motor sequence learning. These processes engage overlapping brain regions with sequence learning, but concrete evidence has been lacking. In this study, we determined whether limits in visuospatial working memory capacity and temporal control abilities affect the temporal organization of explicitly acquired motor sequences. Participants performed an explicit sequence learning task, a visuospatial working memory task, and a continuous tapping timing task. We found that visuospatial working memory capacity, but not the CV from the timing task, correlated with the rate of motor sequence learning and the chunking pattern observed in the learned sequence. These results show that individual differences in short-term visuospatial working memory capacity, but not temporal control, predict the temporal structure of explicitly acquired motor sequences. ",

However, though there are many previous investigations of distinct functional modules within the FG, the functional organization of the whole FG in its full functional heterogeneity has not yet been established. In the current study, a replicable functional organization of the FG based on distinct anatomical connectivity patterns was identified. The FG was parcellated into medial (FGm), lateral (FGl), and anterior (FGa) regions using diffusion tensor imaging. We validated the reasonability of such an organizational scheme from the perspective of resting-state whole brain functional connectivity patterns and the involvement of functional subnetworks. We found corroborating support for these three distinct modules, and suggest that the FGm serves as a transition region that combines multiple stimuli, the FGl is responsible for categorical recognition, and the FGa is involved in semantic understanding. These findings support two organizational functional transitions of the ventral temporal gyrus, a posterior/anterior direction of visual/semantic processing, and a media/lateral direction of high-level visual processing. Our results may facilitate a more detailed study of the human FG in the future. Hum Brain Mapp 37:3003-3016, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ",
pmid_18703313,Structural brain alterations at different stages of schizophrenia: a voxel-based morphometric study.,,"Structural alterations in schizophrenia have mainly been regarded as the result of neurodevelopmental processes. However, it remains unresolved whether the pattern of morphological brain changes differs between different stages of disease. We examined structural brain changes in 93 first-episode (FES) and 72 recurrently ill (REZ) patients with schizophrenia (SZ) and 175 matched healthy control subjects (HC) using cross-sectional and conjunctional voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of whole-brain MRI data in a three-step approach. We found significant grey matter density (GMD) reductions in FES compared to HC bilaterally in the temporal and prefrontal areas, including the anterior cingulate gyrus, as well as in both thalami. Hippocampus and amygdala were affected on the left side (P<0.05, corrected). In REZ patients this pattern was spatially extended. The basal ganglia were exclusively reduced in the recurrently ill group compared to controls. Common to both disease groups were reductions in the bilateral perisylvian regions, the opercular region, the insula, prefrontal cortex, left inferior temporal gyrus, limbic system including hippocampus and amygdala, and the thalami. In FES patients there were no regions affected that were not also affected in REZ patients. In contrast, REZ patients showed extended alterations within the frontal and temporal regions, the hippocampus, amygdala and exclusively in the basal ganglia relative to the FES patients. Our findings suggest a system-specific involvement of neuronal networks in schizophrenia. Furthermore, our data suggest that in the advanced stages of schizophrenia additional cortical and subcortical brain areas become involved in the disease process. Longitudinal data will be required to further test this hypothesis. ",

This study performed voxel-based functional connectivity analysis on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from thirty OCD patients and thirty healthy controls to investigate whole-brain intrinsic functional connectivity patterns in OCD. Relative to the healthy controls, OCD patients showed decreased functional connectivity within the CSTC circuitry but increased functional connectivity in other brain regions. Furthermore, decreased left caudate nucleus-thalamus connectivity within the CSTC circuitry was positively correlated with the illness duration of OCD. This study provides additional evidence that CSTC circuitry may play an essential role and alteration of large-scale brain networks may be involved in the pathophysiology of OCD. ",

Tinnitus pathophysiology has been repeatedly shown to involve both auditory and non-auditory brain structures, making network-level studies of tinnitus critical. In this magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study, two resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) approaches were used to better understand functional network disturbances in tinnitus. First, we demonstrated tinnitus-related reductions in RSFC between specific brain regions and resting-state networks (RSNs), defined by independent components analysis (ICA) and chosen for their overlap with structures known to be affected in tinnitus. Then, we restricted ICA to data from tinnitus patients, and identified one RSN not apparent in control data. This tinnitus RSN included auditory-sensory regions like inferior colliculus and medial Heschl's gyrus, as well as classically non-auditory regions like the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus, striatum, lateral prefrontal, and orbitofrontal cortex. Notably, patients' reported tinnitus loudness was positively correlated with RSFC between the mediodorsal nucleus and the tinnitus RSN, indicating that this network may underlie the auditory-sensory experience of tinnitus. These data support the idea that tinnitus involves network dysfunction, and further stress the importance of communication between auditory-sensory and fronto-striatal circuits in tinnitus pathophysiology.

We hypothesized that ECT response would increase both hippocampal resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity and hippocampal volumes. Patients with major depressive disorder (n=19) were scanned before and after the ECT series. Healthy, demographically matched comparisons (n=20) were scanned at one-time interval. Longitudinal changes in functional connectivity of hippocampal regions and volumes of hippocampal subfields were compared with reductions in ratings of depressive symptoms. Right hippocampal connectivity increased (normalized) after the ECT series and correlated with depressive symptom reduction. Similarly, the volumes of the right hippocampal cornu ammonis (CA2/3), dentate gyrus and subiculum regions increased, but the hippocampal subfields were unchanged relative to the comparison group. Connectivity changes were not evident in the left hippocampus, and volume changes were limited to the left CA2/3 subfields. The laterality of the right hippocampal functional connectivity and volume increases may be related to stimulus delivery method, which was predominately right unilateral in this investigation. The findings suggested that increased hippocampal functional connectivity and volumes may be biomarkers for ECT response. ",

Major depressive disorder
Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI)","Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an important treatment option for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the mechanisms of ECT in MDD are still unclear. Twenty-four patients with severe MDD and 14 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Eight ECT sessions were conducted for MDD patients using brief-pulse square-wave signal at bitemporal locations. To investigate the regional cerebral blood flow in MDD patients before and after ECT treatments by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), the patients were scanned twice (before the first ECT and after the eighth ECT) for data acquisition. Afterward, we adopted fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) to assess the alterations of regional brain activity. Compared with healthy controls, the fALFF in the cerebellum lobe, parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, and thalamus in MDD patients before ECT (pre-ECT) was significantly increased. In another comparison, the fALFF in the cerebellum anterior lobe, fusiform gyrus, insula, parahippocampal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus in pre-ECT patients was significantly greater than the post-ECT fALFF. Only two rs-fMRI scans were conducted at predefined times: before the first and after the eighth ECT treatment. More scans during the ECT sessions would yield more information. In addition, the sample size in this study was limited. The number of control subjects was relatively small. A larger number of subjects would produce more robust findings. The fALFF of both healthy controls and post-ECT patients in cerebellum anterior lobe, fusiform gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus is significantly lower than the fALFF of pre-ECT patients. This finding demonstrates that ECT treatment is effective on these brain areas in MDD patients. ",

the left frontal lobe","As a complex mental process, creativity requires the coordination of multiple brain regions. Previous pathological research on figural creativity has indicated that there is a mechanism by which the left side of the brain inhibits the activities of the right side of the brain during figural creative thinking, but this mechanism has not been directly demonstrated. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to demonstrate the existence of this inhibitory mechanism in young adults (15 women, 11 men, mean age: 22 years) that were not artists. By making comparisons between brain activity during creative and uncreative tasks, we found increased activity in the left middle and inferior frontal lobe and strong decreases in activity in the right middle frontal lobe and the left inferior parietal lobe. As such, these data suggest that the left frontal lobe may inhibit the right hemisphere during figural creative thinking in normal people. Moreover, removal of this inhibition by practicing artistry or through specific damage to the left frontal lobe may facilitate the emergence of artistic creativity. ",
pmid_23511847,The role of imitation in the observed heterogeneity in EEG mu rhythm in autism and typical development.,,"Dysfunction in an execution/observation matching system, or mirror neuron system, has been proposed to contribute to the social deficits observed in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Atypical activity in this system, as reflected in attenuation of the EEG mu rhythm, has been demonstrated in several studies; however, normative patterns of activity have been evident in other ASD samples. The current study sought to investigate this poorly understood heterogeneity in social perceptual brain function in ASD. EEG mu rhythm was recorded in a well-characterized sample of 19 children with ASD (mean age=6.4; 1 female) and 19 age-matched typically developing peers (mean age=6.9; 2 females) during execution and observation of goal-directed hand actions. Children were assessed on variables theoretically related to mirror neuron system function (MNS), such as ASD symptoms and imitation ability. Results indicated that MNS activity was associated with facial imitation ability, but not hand imitation ability, in children with ASD and typically developing individuals. Groups were comparable in terms of average MNS activity during both action observation and execution, but, in both groups, a subset of children showed absent or significantly reduced MNS activity during observation of action in conjunction with greater difficulty in imitation. These results emphasize the relationship between EEG indices of MNS function and imitative skill and suggest that dysfunction of the MNS is related to imitation ability in both clinical and typical populations, rather than representing a core deficit or universal impairment in ASD.

Eyes-closed resting fMRI scans (5:38 min; n = 306, 146 SZ) were collected from 6 Siemens 3T scanners and one GE 3T scanner. Imaging data were pre-processed using an SPM pipeline. Power in the low frequency band (0.01-0.08 Hz) was calculated both for the original pre-processed data as well as for the pre-processed data after regressing out the six rigid-body motion parameters, mean white matter (WM) and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) signals. Both original and regressed ALFF and fALFF measures were modeled with site, diagnosis, age, and diagnosis × age interactions. Regressing out motion and non-gray matter signals significantly decreased fALFF throughout the brain as well as ALFF in the cortical edge, but significantly increased ALFF in subcortical regions. Regression had little effect on site, age, and diagnosis effects on ALFF, other than to reduce diagnosis effects in subcortical regions. There were significant effects of site across the brain in all the analyses, largely due to vendor differences. HC showed greater ALFF in the occipital, posterior parietal, and superior temporal lobe, while SZ showed smaller clusters of greater ALFF in the frontal and temporal/insular regions as well as in the caudate, putamen, and hippocampus. HC showed greater fALFF compared with SZ in all regions, though subcortical differences were only significant for original fALFF. SZ show greater eyes-closed resting state low frequency power in frontal cortex, and less power in posterior lobes than do HC; fALFF, however, is lower in SZ than HC throughout the cortex. These effects are robust to multi-site variability. Regressing out physiological noise signals significantly affects both total and fALFF measures, but does not affect the pattern of case/control differences. ",

However, it remains unclear whether abnormal brain responses to food cues might account for or relate to their abnormal activity in resting state. This information would be useful for understanding the neural mechanisms behind hyperactive responses to food cues, a critical marker of obesity. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) and a cue-reactivity fMRI task with high- (HiCal) and low-caloric (LoCal) food cues were employed to investigate brain baseline activity and food cue-induced activation differences in 44 obese participants (OB), in 37 overweight participants (OW), and in 37 normal weight (NW) controls. One-way analyses of variance showed there was a group difference in the left hippocampus/amygdala activity during resting state and during food-cue stimulation (p ",
pmid_28045309,"Cultural differences and similarities in beliefs, practices, and neural mechanisms of emotion regulation.",,"The current research examined whether culture shapes the beliefs, practices, and neural basis of emotion regulation. Twenty-nine American and Chinese participants reported their implicit theory of emotion and frequency of reappraisal use. They also underwent an fMRI scan while completing an emotion regulation task. Chinese (vs. American) participants reported more frequent use of reappraisal, which was mediated by their higher incremental theory of emotion (i.e., believing that emotion is changeable through effort). Although there were some cultural similarities in neural activation during emotion regulation, Chinese participants showed less ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) activation than American participants when regulating negative emotions. Lower VLPFC activation was associated with higher incremental theory of emotion and more frequent use of cognitive reappraisal. Findings suggest that culture may shape how individuals perceive and engage in emotion regulation, and ultimately, the neural mechanisms underlying emotion regulation. (PsycINFO Database Record ",

Face perception was associated with haemodynamic increases in regions including bilateral fusiform and right superior temporal cortices, and a right posterior negativity (N170), most likely generated in the superior temporal region. Face recognition was associated with haemodynamic increases in fusiform, medial frontal and orbitofrontal cortices, and with a frontocentral positivity from 550 ms poststimulus. Face repetition was associated with a positivity from 400 to 600 ms and behavioural priming. Repetition of familiar faces was also associated with earlier onset of the ERP familiarity effect, and haemodynamic decreases in fusiform cortex. These data support a multi-component model of face-processing, with priming arising from more than one stage. ",

Both ADHD and brain volumes have a strong genetic loading, but whether brain alterations in patients with ADHD are familial has been underexplored. We aimed to detect structural brain alterations in adolescents and young adults with ADHD compared with healthy controls. We examined whether these alterations were also found in their unaffected siblings, using a uniquely large sample. We performed voxel-based morphometry analyses on MRI scans of patients with ADHD, their unaffected siblings and typically developing controls. We identified brain areas that differed between participants with ADHD and controls and investigated whether these areas were different in unaffected siblings. Influences of medication use, age, sex and IQ were considered. Our sample included 307 patients with ADHD, 169 unaffected siblings and 196 typically developing controls (mean age 17.2 [range 8-30] yr). Compared with controls, participants with ADHD had significantly smaller grey matter volume in 5 clusters located in the precentral gyrus, medial and orbitofrontal cortex, and (para)cingulate cortices. Unaffected siblings showed intermediate volumes significantly different from controls in 4 of these clusters (all except the precentral gyrus). Medication use, age, sex and IQ did not have an undue influence on the results. Our sample was heterogeneous, most participants with ADHD were taking medication, and the comparison was cross-sectional. Brain areas involved in decision making, motivation, cognitive control and motor functioning were smaller in participants with ADHD than in controls. Investigation of unaffected siblings indicated familiality of 4 of the structural brain differences, supporting their potential in molecular genetic analyses in ADHD research. ",

Regional normalized CBF (z-CBF) and CBF-connectivity were analyzed from ASL data in 44 amnestic MCI (aMCI) patients, 42 PD-MCI patients, and 50 matched HC participants. The correlations between these signiﬁcant regions and clinical performance were investigated separately using Spearman correlation analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was generated to determine the differentiating ability of z-CBF values. z-CBF values in disease-related specific regions were extracted for group comparison. MCI subgroups showed overlapped impaired regions, aMCI group seemed more extensive than the PD-MCI group. PD-MCI patients had reduced z-CBF in the bilateral putamen, left precentral gyrus, left middle cingulate gyrus, and right middle frontal gyrus compared to aMCI group. Correlations to executive performance and motor severity were found in PD-MCI group, and correlations were to memory performance found in aMCI group. CBF-connectivity in left precentral gyrus, left middle cingulate gyrus, and right middle frontal gyrus were significantly altered. All of the significant clusters had good discriminatory ability. Normalized CBF as measured by ASL revealed different patterns of perfusion between aMCI and PD-MCI, which were probably linked to distinct neural mechanisms. The present study indicates that z-CBF can provide specific perfusion information for further pathological and neuropsychological studies. ",
pmid_18509047,The neural mechanisms underlying the influence of pavlovian cues on human decision making.,,"In outcome-specific transfer, pavlovian cues that are predictive of specific outcomes bias action choice toward actions associated with those outcomes. This transfer occurs despite no explicit training of the instrumental actions in the presence of pavlovian cues. The neural substrates of this effect in humans are unknown. To address this, we scanned 23 human subjects with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they made choices between different liquid food rewards in the presence of pavlovian cues previously associated with one of these outcomes. We found behavioral evidence of outcome-specific transfer effects in our subjects, as well as differential blood oxygenation level-dependent activity in a region of ventrolateral putamen when subjects chose, respectively, actions consistent and inconsistent with the pavlovian-predicted outcome. Our results suggest that choosing an action incompatible with a pavlovian-predicted outcome might require the inhibition of feasible but nonselected action-outcome associations. The results of this study are relevant for understanding how marketing actions can affect consumer choice behavior as well as for how environmental cues can influence drug-seeking behavior in addiction.

The auditory resting-state component was selected using an automatic component selection approach. Functional connectivity (correlations/anti-correlations) in the extracted network was portrayed by integrating the independent component analysis (ICA) approach with a graph theory method. Tinnitus and control groups showed different graph connectivity patterns. In the control group, the connectivity graph was divided into two distinct anti-correlated networks. The first one encompassed the auditory cortices and the insula. The second one encompassed frontoparietal and anterior cingulate cortices, brainstem, amygdala, basal ganglia/nucleus accumbens and parahippocampal regions. In the tinnitus group, only one of the two previously described networks was observed, encompassing the auditory cortices and the insula. Direct group comparison showed, in the tinnitus group, an increased functional connectivity between auditory cortices and the left parahippocampal region surviving multiple comparisons. We investigated a possible correlation between four tinnitus relevant measures (tinnitus handicap inventory (THI) and tinnitus questionnaire (TQ) scores, tinnitus duration and tinnitus intensity during the scanning session) and the connectivity pattern in the tinnitus population. We observed a significant positive correlation between the beta values of the posterior cingulate/precuneus region and the THI score. Our results show a modified functional connectivity pattern in tinnitus sufferers and highlight the role of the parahippocampal region in tinnitus physiopathology. They also point out the importance of the activity and connectivity pattern of the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus region to the development of the tinnitus associated distress.

Consistent extra-motor as well as motor cerebral, spinal anterior horn and distal neuromuscular junction pathology supports the notion of ALS a system failure. Establishing a disease biomarker is a priority but a simplistic, coordinate-based approach to brain dysfunction using MRI is not tenable. Resting-state functional MRI reflects the organization of brain networks at the systems-level, and so changes in of motor functional connectivity were explored to determine their potential as the substrate for a biomarker signature. Intra- as well as inter-motor functional networks in the 0.03-0.06 Hz frequency band were derived from 40 patients and 30 healthy controls of similar age, and used as features for pattern detection, employing multiple kernel learning. This approach enabled an accurate classification of a group of patients that included a range of clinical sub-types. An average of 13 regions-of-interest were needed to reach peak discrimination. Subsequent analysis revealed that the alterations in motor functional connectivity were widespread, including regions not obviously clinically affected such as the cerebellum and basal ganglia. Complex network analysis showed that functional networks in ALS differ markedly in their topology, reflecting the underlying altered functional connectivity pattern seen in patients: 1) reduced connectivity of both the cortical and sub-cortical motor areas with non motor areas 2)reduced subcortical-cortical motor connectivity and 3) increased connectivity observed within sub-cortical motor networks. This type of analysis has potential to non-invasively define a biomarker signature at the systems-level. As the understanding of neurodegenerative disorders moves towards studying pre-symptomatic changes, there is potential for this type of approach to generate biomarkers for the testing of neuroprotective strategies.

fMRI","Alcohol dependence is associated with impaired response inhibition and heightened cue reactivity towards alcohol-related stimuli. Several brain areas, but mainly prefrontal structures, have been linked to response inhibition in addiction. This study aimed at combining both aspects: salience of drug-associated cues and response inhibition using a go/no-go task with alcohol-associated stimuli during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Nineteen abstinent alcohol-dependent patients (ADP) and 21 healthy control subjects (HC) were compared on blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses during successful inhibition of no-go stimuli and successful reactions to go stimuli. ADP and HC did not significantly differ in their behavioural performance in the task. However, both groups performed worse during the inhibition of alcoholic-associated stimuli compared to neutral stimuli. On the neural level, ADP displayed enhanced BOLD activity relative to HC during successful response inhibition in several areas involved in visual processing, cognitive and impulse control, including occipital structures, anterior cingulate gyrus, medial frontal gyrus and medial orbitofrontal cortex. We interpret these findings as a possible compensation strategy for impaired cognitive processing. Furthermore, the results underline the impact of salience of alcohol-related stimuli on response inhibition, which seems to affect both ADP and HC. ",

This study compared the brain function of tobacco-exposed (n = 7) and unexposed (n = 11) 12-year-olds during a number N-back working memory task using an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) design. Prenatal alcohol exposure, neonatal medical problems, environmental risk, and sex were statistically controlled. Tobacco-exposed children showed greater activation in inferior parietal regions, whereas unexposed children showed greater activation in inferior frontal regions. These differences were observed in the context of correct responses, suggesting that exposed and unexposed children use different brain regions and approaches to succeed in working memory tasks. Implications for future research and intervention are discussed. ",

Although recent neuroscience studies have used the ultimatum game to understand the neuropsychological mechanisms that underlie the enforcement of fairness norms; however, a precise characterization of the neural systems underlying fairness-related norm enforcement remains elusive. In this study, we used a coordinate-based meta-analysis on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies using the ultimatum game with the goal to provide an additional level of evidence for the refinement of the underlying neural architecture of this human puzzling behavior. Our results demonstrated a convergence of reported activation foci in brain networks associated with psychological components of fairness-related normative decision making, presumably reflecting a reflexive and intuitive system (System 1) and a reflective and deliberate system (System 2). System 1 (anterior insula, ventromedial prefrontal cortex [PFC]) may be associated with the reflexive and intuitive responses to norm violations, representing a motivation to punish norm violators. Those intuitive responses conflict with economic self-interest, encoded in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which may engage cognitive control from a reflective and deliberate System 2 to resolve the conflict by either suppressing (ventrolateral PFC, dorsomedial PFC, left dorsolateral PFC, and rostral ACC) the intuitive responses or over-riding self-interest (right dorsolateral PFC). Taken together, we suggest that fairness-related norm enforcement recruits an intuitive system for rapid evaluation of norm violations and a deliberate system for integrating both social norms and self-interest to regulate the intuitive system in favor of more flexible decision making.

Previous studies have identified brain abnormalities in abstinent alcoholics. However, whether these persistent brain deficits in abstinence could predict early relapse to alcohol use has not been well established. This study aimed to identify biomarkers of relapse vulnerability by investigating persistent brain abnormalities in abstinent alcohol-dependent patients. Brain imaging and impulsive behavior data were collected from 56 abstinent alcohol-dependent male inpatients and 33 age-matched male healthy controls. Voxel-based morphometry was used to investigate the differences of grey matter volume between the groups. The resting-state functional connectivity was examined using brain areas with gray matter deficits as seed regions. A preliminary prospective study design was used to classify patients into abstainers and relapsers after a 62-day average abstinence period. Compared with healthy controls, both relapsers and abstainers exhibited significantly reduced gray matter volume in the cuneus. Functional connectivity analysis revealed that relapsers relative to abstainers demonstrated increased cuneus-centered negative functional connectivity within a network of brain regions which are involved in executive control and salience. Abnormal gray matter volume in the left cuneus and the functional connectivity between the right cuneus and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex could successfully predict relapse during the 3-month follow-up period. Findings suggest that the abnormal gray matter volume in the cuneus and resting-state cuneus-prefrontal functional connectivity may play an important role in poor treatment outcomes in alcoholics and serve as useful neural markers of relapse vulnerability.

No functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have directly examined fluid reasoning in ADHD which is surprising given that studies demonstrate a consistent network of brain regions involved in fluid reasoning that are also implicated in the pathogenesis of ADHD. Twenty-two right-handed, non-medicated children (12 ADHD, 10 controls) ages 8-12 years completed a fluid reasoning task during which fMRI data were collected. The primary comparison of interest was activation during the fluid reasoning compared to the control condition. Behavioral data showed that children with ADHD tended to be less accurate with faster reaction times in the fluid reasoning condition compared to controls, and were significantly less accurate in the control condition. Controls activated more than participants with ADHD in the right intraparietal sulcus and the left lateral cerebellum in the fluid reasoning condition. Results showed hypoactivation in ADHD in regions critical for fluid reasoning. These results add to the literature suggesting a role for parietal and cerebellar regions in cognition and ADHD. ",

We compared the current method, regional homogeneity based on coherence (Cohe-ReHo), with previously proposed method, ReHo based on Kendall's coefficient of concordance (KCC-ReHo), in terms of correlation and paired t-test in a large sample of healthy participants. We found the two measurements differed mainly in some brain regions where physiological noise is dominant. We also compared the sensitivity of these methods in detecting difference between resting-state conditions [eyes open (EO) vs. eyes closed (EC)] and in detecting abnormal local synchronization between two groups [attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients vs. normal controls]. Our results indicated that Cohe-ReHo is more sensitive than KCC-ReHo to the difference between two conditions (EO vs. EC) as well as that between ADHD and normal controls. These preliminary results suggest that Cohe-ReHo is superior to KCC-ReHo. A possible reason is that coherence is not susceptible to random noise induced by phase delay among the time courses to be measured. However, further investigation is still needed to elucidate the sensitivity and specificity of these methods. ",

Participants between 50 and 70 years old were recruited and randomized into a Tai Chi Chuan, Baduanjin or control group. The Wechsler Memory Scale-Chinese Revision and resting-state fMRI scans were administered at baseline and following 12 weeks of exercise. Seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) was calculated. We found that (i) compared to the Baduanjin group, Tai Chi Chuan was significantly associated with increased rsFC between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and right putamen/caudate and (ii) compared to the control group, Tai Chi Chuan increased posterior cingulate cortex rsFC with the right putamen/caudate, while Baduanjin decreased rsFC between the mPFC and orbital prefrontal gyrus/putamen. Baseline mPFC rsFC with orbital prefrontal gyrus was negatively correlated with visual reproduction subscore. These results suggest that both Tai Chi Chuan and Baduanjin can modulate the DMN, but through different pathways. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying different mind-body interventions may shed light on the development of new methods to prevent age-related diseases as well as other disorders associated with disrupted DMN.

However, altered patterns of the intrinsic activity of the DMN in both deficit schizophrenia (DS) and non-deficit schizophrenia (NDS) patients, as well as the neurocognitive relationships among them, remain unknown. This study explores the resting-state characteristics of the DMN activity in both DS and NDS patients, and further investigates correlations with neurocognitive features. Demographic, resting-state functional MRI, and neurocognitive data were collected in 37 DS and 38 NDS patients, as well as in 38 matched healthy control subjects (HCs). Independent component analysis was conducted to investigate the characteristics of DMN activity and to further distinguish between common and specific altered regions. In addition, partial correlation analysis was conducted to examine associations between the activity of altered regions and neurocognitive assessments. Overlapping altered brain activity was observed in both DS and NDS patients in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), the left angular gyrus (ANG), and the calcarine sulcus (CAL) region. Furthermore, compared to HCs, DS patients showed less activity in the right inferior temporal gyrus, the right para-hippocampal gyrus / hippocampus (PHP / HIP), and the left precuneus (PCUN), while they showed increased activity in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Notably, NDS patients showed less activity in the bilateral middle occipital gyrus. Correlation analysis indicated that, in the DS group, both Trail Making Test (TMT)-B and spatial processing scores were positively associated with the activities of the left PCUN and the right PHP / HIP, while the Stroop color scores were negatively associated with PCC activity. In the NDS group, the TMT-B scores were associated with activities of the left MFG and CAL regions, while the scores of the Wechsler adult intelligence scale (Chinese revision) were negatively associated with CAL region activity. The present study demonstrates convergent and divergent altered patterns of the DMN in both DS and NDS patients. Importantly, the specific altered regions of the DMN in DS patients may be associated with extensive deficient neurocognition, indicating novel insights into the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.

Stop signal task
Top–down","Previous studies have examined the neural correlates of proactive control using a variety of behavioral paradigms; however, the neural network relating the control process to its behavioral consequence remains unclear. Here, we applied a dynamic Bayesian model to a large fMRI data set of the stop signal task to address this issue. By estimating the probability of the stop signal - p(Stop) - trial by trial, we showed that higher p(Stop) is associated with prolonged go trial reaction time (RT), indicating proactive control of motor response. In modeling fMRI signals at trial and target onsets, we distinguished activities of proactive control, prediction error, and RT slowing. We showed that the anterior pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) responds specifically to increased stop signal likelihood, and its activity is correlated with activations of the posterior pre-SMA and bilateral anterior insula during prolonged response times. This directional link is also supported by Granger causality analysis. Furthermore, proactive control, prediction error, and time-on-task are each mapped to distinct areas in the medial prefrontal cortex. Together, these findings dissect regional functions of the medial prefrontal cortex in cognitive control and provide system level evidence associating conflict anticipation with its motor consequence.

In this study, we compared neural activities of BD and MDD patients during the first-episode (FE) to investigate common and distinct neural activities and further explore predictive indicators in the two diseases. FE-MDD patients were performed resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging and followed up after scanning. After follow-up, FE-MDD patients were regrouped into FE-BD and FE-MDD patients. The study included 24 FE-BD patients, 28 FE-MDD patients, and 30 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) to investigate neural activities with regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis among the 3 groups. Compared to HC, FE-BD patients displayed significantly higher ReHo values in the superior frontal gyrus, the medial superior frontal gyrus within right-side cerebral hemisphere than FE-MDD patients and HC. Compared to HC, FE-BD and FE-MDD patients displayed significant decreased ReHo values in the paracentral lobule, the precuneus and the median cingulate and paracingulate gyrus within bilateral cerebral hemisphere, and the postcentral gyrus and the precentral gyrus within the right-side. FE-BD displayed significant lower ReHo values than FE-MDD patients in these regions. The potential effects of medicine, age, course of disease and handedness on results could not be ignored. Abnormal neural activities of frontoparietal network may provide common and distinct markers to affective disorders and scientific basis for further prediction researches of affective disorders. ",
pmid_24155323,Neural underpinnings of the identifiable victim effect: affect shifts preferences for giving.,,"The ""identifiable victim effect"" refers to peoples' tendency to preferentially give to identified versus anonymous victims of misfortune, and has been proposed to partly depend on affect. By soliciting charitable donations from human subjects during behavioral and neural (i.e., functional magnetic resonance imaging) experiments, we sought to determine whether and how affect might promote the identifiable victim effect. Behaviorally, subjects gave more to orphans depicted by photographs versus silhouettes, and their shift in preferences was mediated by photograph-induced feelings of positive arousal, but not negative arousal. Neurally, while photographs versus silhouettes elicited activity in widespread circuits associated with facial and affective processing, only nucleus accumbens activity predicted and could statistically account for increased donations. Together, these findings suggest that presenting evaluable identifiable information can recruit positive arousal, which then promotes giving. We propose that affect elicited by identifiable stimuli can compel people to give more to strangers, even despite costs to the self. ",
pmid_17405670,Directional disorientation following left retrosplenial hemorrhage: a case report with fMRI studies.,,"We report a 55-year-old right-handed man who presented with topographical disorientation following left retrosplenial hemorrhage. His directional information about familiar places, encoded by previous navigation, was severely impaired, and he could not learn the direction to new places in large-scale spaces beyond the range of visual surveillance. By contrast, he had no difficulties with directional information encoded in a tabletop manner: he could locate major cities or countries on a map, and he also could memorize the spatial relationship of objects in a room. Six months after the ictus, when he had recovered from his directional disorientation, a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of mental navigation demonstrated prominent activation in the retrosplenial area along the right parieto-occipital sulcus and the circumference of the injured area on the left side. The present study, together with previous investigations including clinical case reports, functional neuroimaging, and anatomical and physiological studies on monkeys, suggests that the 'sense of direction' in a large-scale locomotor environment is subserved by the visual area along the parieto-occipital sulcus, and that bilateral deterioration of this function causes directional disorientation.

pmid_21538379,Neuroanatomy of childhood disruptive behavior disorders.,,"Our aims were to (1) examine possible neuroanatomical abnormalities associated with the Disruptive Behavior Disorders (DBDs) as a group and (2) assess neuroanatomical anomalies specific to each DBD (i.e., conduct disorder [CD] and oppositional defiant disorder). Cortical thickness analysis and voxel-based morphometry were analyzed in 47 8-year-old boys (22 DBDs with and without CD and/or ODD and 25 healthy controls) from Magnetic Resonance Imaging brain scans. DBD symptoms were assessed using the Dominic-R. In DBD subjects relative to controls, we found (1) a decreased overall mean cortical thickness; (2) thinning of the cingulate, prefrontal and insular cortices; and (3) decreased gray matter density (GMd) in the same brain regions. We also found that scores on the Dominic-R were negatively correlated with GMd in the prefrontal and precuneus/superior temporal regions. There was a subdiagnostic main effect for CD, related to thinning of the middle/medial frontal, and for ODD in the left rectal/orbitofrontal. Findings suggest that thinning and decreased GMd of the insula disorganizes prefrontal circuits, diminishing the inhibitory influence of the prefrontal cortex on anger, aggression, cruelty, and impulsivity, and increasing a person's likelihood of aggressive behavior. These findings have implications for pathophysiologic models of the DBDs, their diagnostic classification system, and for designing more effective intervention programs. ",
pmid_18155446,Automatization and working memory capacity in schizophrenia.,,"Working memory (WM) dysfunction in schizophrenia is characterized by inefficient WM recruitment and reduced capacity, but it is not yet clear how these relate to one another. In controls practice of certain cognitive tasks induces automatization, which is associated with reduced WM recruitment and increased capacity of concurrent task performance. We therefore investigated whether inefficient function and reduced capacity in schizophrenia was associated with a failure in automatization. FMRI data was acquired with a verbal WM task with novel and practiced stimuli in 18 schizophrenia patients and 18 controls. Participants performed a dual-task outside the scanner to test WM capacity. Patients showed intact performance on the WM task, which was paralleled by excessive WM activity. Practice improved performance and reduced WM activity in both groups. The difference in WM activity after practice predicted performance cost in controls but not in patients. In addition, patients showed disproportionately poor dual-task performance compared to controls, especially when processing information that required continuous adjustment in WM. Our findings support the notion of inefficient WM function and reduced capacity in schizophrenia. This was not related to a failure in automatization, but was evident when processing continuously changing information. This suggests that inefficient WM function and reduced capacity may be related to an inability to process information requiring frequent updating. ",
pmid_23028892,Resting-state functional connectivity bias of middle temporal gyrus and caudate with altered gray matter volume in major depression.,,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have indicated that the structure deficits and resting-state functional connectivity (FC) imbalances in cortico-limbic circuitry might underline the pathophysiology of MDD. Using structure and functional MRI, our aim is to investigate gray matter abnormalities in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and treatment-responsive depression (TSD), and test whether the altered gray matter is associated with altered FC. Voxel-based morphometry was used to investigate the regions with gray matter abnormality and FC analysis was further conducted between each gray matter abnormal region and the remaining voxels in the brain. Using one-way analysis of variance, we found significant gray matter abnormalities in the right middle temporal cortex (MTG) and bilateral caudate among the TRD, TSD and healthy controls. For the FC of the right MTG, we found that both the patients with TRD and TSD showed altered connectivity mainly in the default-mode network (DMN). For the FC of the right caudate, both patient groups showed altered connectivity in the frontal regions. Our results revealed the gray matter reduction of right MTG and bilateral caudate, and disrupted functional connection to widely distributed circuitry in DMN and frontal regions, respectively. These results suggest that the abnormal DMN and reward circuit activity might be biomarkers of depression trait. ",

We found that, although people estimated their abilities on the basis of their own performance in a rational manner, their estimates of themselves were partly merged with the performance of others. Reciprocally, their ability estimates for others also reflected their own, as well as the others', performance. Self-other mergence operated in a context-dependent manner: interacting with high or low performers, respectively, enhanced and diminished own ability estimates in cooperative contexts, but the opposite occurred in competitive contexts. Self-other mergence not only influenced subjective evaluations, it also affected how people subsequently objectively adjusted their performance. Perigenual anterior cingulate cortex tracked one's own performance. Dorsomedial frontal area 9 tracked others' performances, but also integrated contextual and self-related information. Self-other mergence increased with the strength of self and other representations in area 9, suggesting it carries interdependent representations of self and other. ",

This study aimed to explore the modulation of hippocampal subregions as a mechanism by which Baduanjin exercise improves cognitive frailty in older adults. A total of 102 community-dwelling older adults with cognitive frailty were recruited and randomly allocated to the Baduanjin exercise training group and usual physical activity control group. The participants in the Baduanjin exercise training group participated in a 24-week Baduanjin exercise intervention program with an exercise frequency of 60 min per day, 3 days per week. Cognitive ability and physical frailty were assessed, and MRI scans were performed on all participants at baseline and after 24 weeks of intervention. The structural MRI data were processed with MRIConvert (version 2.0 Rev. 235) and FreeSurfer (version 6.0.0) software. Data analyses were performed using the independent sample  After 24 weeks of intervention, a statistically significant increase was found for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores ( A 24-week Baduanjin exercise intervention effectively improved cognitive ability and reduced physical frailty in community-dwelling older adults with cognitive frailty, and the mechanism might be associated with modulating the structural plasticity of the hippocampal subregion.

pmid_25048028,Neural basis of anticipatory anxiety reappraisals.,,"Reappraisal is a well-known emotion regulation strategy. Recent neuroimaging studies suggest that reappraisal recruits both medial and lateral prefrontal brain regions. However, few studies have investigated neural representation of reappraisals associated with anticipatory anxiety, and the specific nature of the brain activity underlying this process remains unclear. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural activity associated with reappraisals of transient anticipatory anxiety. Although transient anxiety activated mainly subcortical regions, reappraisals targeting the anxiety were associated with increased activity in the medial and lateral prefrontal regions (including the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices). Reappraisal decreased fear circuit activity (including the amygdala and thalamus). Correlational analysis demonstrated that reductions in subjective anxiety associated with reappraisal were correlated with orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex activation. Reappraisal recruits medial and lateral prefrontal regions; particularly the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices are associated with successful use of this emotion regulation strategy. ",

The insula is a critical brain structure for coordinating affective, cognitive memory, saliency processing, and attention switching suggesting functional activity of insula maybe an important indicator to delineate the treatment and side effects of ECT. Here, Resting-state functional connectivity analyses of insular subregions were performed to reveal the changes of connectivity in 23 MDD patients before and after ECT and 25 healthy control (HC) and identified significantly increased functional connectivity of the right ventral anterior insular subregion with bilateral caudate, angular gyrus, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex after ECT. Granger causality analyses identified significantly increased effective connectivity from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to right angular gyrus in MDD patients after ECT. Furthermore, increased effective connectivity from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to right angular gyrus exhibited significantly positive correlation with changed Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores. These results showed that ECT can normalize abnormal functional connectivity and effective connectivity in MDD. Our findings also indicated that the right ventral anterior insula and effective connectivity from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to right angular gyrus are biomarkers of antidepressant effects during ECT of MDD.

pmid_32730766,Brain insulin resistance in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders: mechanisms and therapeutic approaches.,,"Insulin is a peptide secreted by the pancreas and plays an important role in the regulation of glucose metabolism in peripheral tissues. Although the role of insulin in the periphery is well understood, less is known about its multifactorial role in the brain. However, emerging evidence from human and animal studies indicate that insulin influences cerebral bioenergetics, enhances synaptic viability and dendritic spine formation, and increases turnover of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine. Insulin also has a role in proteostasis, influencing clearance of the amyloid β peptide and phosphorylation of tau, which are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Insulin also modulates vascular function through effects on vasoreactivity, lipid metabolism, and inflammation. Through these multiple pathways, insulin dysregulation could contribute to neurodegeneration. Thus, new approaches to restore cerebral insulin function that could offer therapeutic benefit to adults with Alzheimer's disease, vascular cognitive impairment, or related disorders are being investigated.

Altered resting brain functional connectivity (FC) in ALS has been reported in several studies but with large discrepancies in terms of the alteration directions. The purpose of this study was to provide new evidence for the resting FC disruptions in ALS. We focused on FC in the motor network as motor dysfunctions are a hallmark of ALS pathology. To test the hypothesis that ALS is associated with intermotor network FC changes, we compared FC of the key nodes of motor network between 12 ALS patients and 12 matched controls, and found both decreased and increased within-motor network FC in ALS patients. Increased FC between the bilateral superior parietal lobule and the right anterior inferior cerebellum was found to be correlated with disease severity, with higher FC related to more severe disease. The decreased motor network FC may be a result of motor function degradation in ALS, whereas the increased FC and its correlation to disease severity might suggest a brain mechanism to compensate the loss of the normal motor functionality in ALS. Our results also showed that the within-motor cortex FC except the within premotor area FC did not change in these early disease stage patients. ",
pmid_20223285,Neural correlates of focused attention and cognitive monitoring in meditation.,,"Meditation refers to a family of complex emotional and attentional regulatory practices, which can be classified into two main styles - focused attention (FA) and open monitoring (OM) - involving different attentional, cognitive monitoring and awareness processes. In a functional magnetic resonance study we originally characterized and contrasted FA and OM meditation forms within the same experiment, by an integrated FA-OM design. Theravada Buddhist monks, expert in both FA and OM meditation forms, and lay novices with 10 days of meditation practice, participated in the experiment. Our evidence suggests that expert meditators control cognitive engagement in conscious processing of sensory-related, thought and emotion contents, by massive self-regulation of fronto-parietal and insular areas in the left hemisphere, in a meditation state-dependent fashion. We also found that anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices play antagonist roles in the executive control of the attention setting in meditation tasks. Our findings resolve the controversy between the hypothesis that meditative states are associated to transient hypofrontality or deactivation of executive brain areas, and evidence about the activation of executive brain areas in meditation. Finally, our study suggests that a functional reorganization of brain activity patterns for focused attention and cognitive monitoring takes place with mental practice, and that meditation-related neuroplasticity is crucially associated to a functional reorganization of activity patterns in prefrontal cortex and in the insula.

pmid_21220097,Dysregulation of limbic and auditory networks in tinnitus.,,"Tinnitus is a common disorder characterized by ringing in the ear in the absence of sound. Converging evidence suggests that tinnitus pathophysiology involves damage to peripheral and/or central auditory pathways. However, whether auditory system dysfunction is sufficient to explain chronic tinnitus is unclear, especially in light of evidence implicating other networks, including the limbic system. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry, we assessed tinnitus-related functional and anatomical anomalies in auditory and limbic networks. Moderate hyperactivity was present in the primary and posterior auditory cortices of tinnitus patients. However, the nucleus accumbens exhibited the greatest degree of hyperactivity, specifically to sounds frequency-matched to patients' tinnitus. Complementary structural differences were identified in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, another limbic structure heavily connected to the nucleus accumbens. Furthermore, tinnitus-related anomalies were intercorrelated in the two limbic regions and between limbic and primary auditory areas, indicating the importance of auditory-limbic interactions in tinnitus.

pmid_15506871,"An fMRI study of episodic memory: retrieval of object, spatial, and temporal information.",,"Sixteen participants viewed a videotaped tour of 4 houses that highlighted a series of objects and their spatial locations. Participants were tested for memory of object, spatial, and temporal-order information while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Preferential activation was observed in the right parahippocampal gyrus during the retrieval of spatial-location information. Retrieval of contextual information (spatial location and temporal order) was associated with activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In bilateral posterior parietal regions, greater activation was associated with processing of visual scenes regardless of the memory judgment. These findings support current theories positing roles for frontal and medial temporal regions during episodic retrieval and suggest a specific role for the hippocampal complex in the retrieval of spatial-location information.

pmid_21362744,Resting-state functional connectivity in treatment-resistant depression.,,"The authors used resting-state functional connectivity MRI to evaluate brain networks in patients with refractory and nonrefractory major depressive disorder. In a cross-sectional study, 28 patients with refractory major depression, 32 patients with nonrefractory major depression, and 48 healthy comparison subjects underwent scanning using a gradient-echo echo-planar imaging sequence on a 3-T MR system. Thirteen regions of interest that have been identified in the literature as relevant to mood regulation were selected as seed areas. A reference time series was extracted for each seed and used for voxel-wise correlation analysis with the rest of the brain. Voxel-based comparisons of z-value maps among the three groups were performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc t tests with age and duration of illness as covariates of no interest. Relative to healthy comparison subjects, both patient groups showed significantly reduced connectivity in prefrontal-limbic-thalamic areas bilaterally. However, the nonrefractory group showed a more distributed decrease in connectivity than the refractory group, especially in the anterior cingulate cortex and in the amygdala, hippocampus, and insula bilaterally; in contrast, the refractory group showed disrupted functional connectivity mainly in prefrontal areas and in thalamus areas bilaterally. Refractory depression is associated with disrupted functional connectivity mainly in thalamo-cortical circuits, while nonrefractory depression is associated with more distributed decreased connectivity in the limbic-striatal-pallidal-thalamic circuit. These results suggest that nonrefractory and refractory depression are characterized by distinct functional deficits in distributed brain networks. ",

fMRI","To grasp an object, we need to move the arm toward it and assume the appropriate hand configuration. While previous studies suggested dorsomedial and dorsolateral pathways in the brain specialized respectively for the transport and grip components, more recent studies cast doubt on such a clear-cut distinction. It is unclear, however, to which degree neuronal populations selective for the two components overlap, and if so, to which degree they interact. Here, we used multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to investigate the representation of three center-out movements (touch, pincer grip, whole-hand grip) performed in five reach directions. We found selectivity exclusively for reach direction in posterior and rostral superior parietal lobes (SPLp, SPLr), supplementary motor area (SMA), and the superior portion of dorsal premotor cortex (PMDs). Instead, we found selectivity for both grip type and reach direction in the inferior portion of dorsal premotor cortex (PMDi), ventral premotor cortex (PMv), anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS), primary motor (M1), somatosensory (S1) cortices and the anterior superior parietal lobe (SPLa). Within these regions, PMv, M1, aIPS and SPLa showed weak interactions between the transport and grip components. Our results suggest that human PMDi and S1 contain both grip- and reach-direction selective neuronal populations that retain their functional independence, whereas this information might be combined at the level of PMv, M1, aIPS, and SPLa.

pmid_20398771,Neural mechanism of unconscious perception of surprised facial expression.,,"Previous functional neuroimaging studies have uncovered partly separable neural substrates for perceiving different facial expressions presented below the level of conscious awareness. However, as one of the six basic emotions, the neural mechanism of unconsciously perceiving surprised faces has not yet been investigated. Using a backward masking procedure, we studied the neural activities in response to surprised faces presented below the threshold of conscious visual perception by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Eighteen healthy adults were scanned while viewing surprised faces, which presented for 33 ms and immediately ""masked"" by a neutral face for 467 ms. As a control, they viewed masked happy or neutral faces as well. In comparison to both control conditions, masked surprised faces yielded significantly greater activation in the parahippocampal gyrus and fusiform gyrus, which associated previously with novelty detection. In the present study, automatic activation of these areas to masked surprised faces was investigated as a function of individual differences in the ability of identifying and differentiating one's emotions, as assessed by the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). The correlation results showed that, the subscale, Difficulty Identifying Feelings, was negatively correlated with the neural response of these areas to masked surprised faces, which suggest that decreased activation magnitude in specific brain regions may reflect increased difficulties in recognizing one's emotions in everyday life. Additionally, we confirmed activation of the right amygdala and right thalamus to the masked surprised faces, which was previously proved to be involved in the unconscious emotional perception system.

pmid_15538599,Structural brain differences in patients with schizophrenia and schizotypal disorder demonstrated by voxel-based morphometry.,,"Brain abnormalities of schizophrenia probably consist of deviation related to the vulnerability and pathological changes in association with overt psychosis. We conducted a cross-sectional comparison in brain morphology between patients with overt schizophrenia and schizotypal disorder, a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder without florid psychotic episode. Voxelbased morphometry was applied to assess gray matter volume in 25 patients with schizophrenia, 25 patients with schizotypal disorder, and 50 healthy control subjects. In comparison with controls, schizophrenia patients showed gray matter reductions in the bilateral medial frontal, inferior frontal, medial temporal, and septal regions, and the left middle frontal, orbitofrontal, insula, and superior temporal regions, and an increased gray matter in the left basal ganglia. Schizotypal disorder patients showed reductions in the left inferior frontal, insula, superior temporal, and medial temporal regions. There was a significant reduction in the left orbitofrontal region of schizophrenia compared with schizotypal disorder. Gray matter reductions that are common to both patient groups such as those in the left medial temporal and inferior frontal regions may represent vulnerability to schizophrenia, and additional involvement of several frontal regions may be crucial to florid psychosis.

pmid_21567664,Brain systems for baroreflex suppression during stress in humans.,,"The arterial baroreflex is a key mechanism for the homeostatic control of blood pressure (BP). In animals and humans, psychological stressors suppress the capacity of the arterial baroreflex to control short-term fluctuations in BP, reflected by reduced baroreflex sensitivity (BRS). While animal studies have characterized the brain systems that link stressor processing to BRS suppression, comparable human studies are lacking. Here, we measured beat-to-beat BP and heart rate (HR) in 97 adults who performed a multisource interference task that evoked changes in spontaneous BRS, which were quantified by a validated sequence method. The same 97 participants also performed the task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain activity. Across participants, task performance (i) increased BP and HR and (ii) reduced BRS. Analyses of fMRI data further demonstrated that a greater task-evoked reduction in BRS covaried with greater activity in brain systems important for central autonomic and cardiovascular control, particularly the cingulate cortex, insula, amygdala, and midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG). Moreover, task performance increased the functional connectivity of a discrete area of the anterior insula with both the cingulate cortex and amygdala. In parallel, this same insula area showed increased task-evoked functional connectivity with midbrain PAG and pons. These novel findings provide human evidence for the brain systems presumptively involved in suppressing baroreflex functionality, with relevance for understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of stressor-related cardiovascular reactivity and associated risk for essential hypertension and atherosclerotic heart disease.

pmid_21772062,Neural changes following cognitive behaviour therapy for psychosis: a longitudinal study.,,"A growing body of evidence demonstrates that persistent positive symptoms, particularly delusions, can be improved by cognitive behaviour therapy for psychosis. Heightened perception and processing of threat are believed to constitute the genesis of delusions. The present study aimed to examine functional brain changes following cognitive behaviour therapy for psychosis. The study involved 56 outpatients with one or more persistent positive distressing symptoms of schizophrenia. Twenty-eight patients receiving cognitive behaviour therapy for psychosis for 6-8 months in addition to their usual treatment were matched with 28 patients receiving treatment as usual. Patients' symptoms were assessed by a rater blind to treatment group, and they underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during an affect processing task at baseline and end of treatment follow-up. The two groups were comparable at baseline in terms of clinical and demographic parameters and neural and behavioural responses to facial and control stimuli. The cognitive behaviour therapy for psychosis with treatment-as-usual group (22 subjects) showed significant clinical improvement compared with the treatment-as-usual group (16 subjects), which showed no change at follow-up. The cognitive behaviour therapy for psychosis with treatment-as-usual group, but not the treatment-as-usual group, showed decreased activation of the inferior frontal, insula, thalamus, putamen and occipital areas to fearful and angry expressions at treatment follow-up compared with baseline. Reduction of functional magnetic resonance imaging response during angry expressions correlated directly with symptom improvement. This study provides the first evidence that cognitive behaviour therapy for psychosis attenuates brain responses to threatening stimuli and suggests that cognitive behaviour therapy for psychosis may mediate symptom reduction by promoting processing of threats in a less distressing way.

Moreover, although externalizing behavior problems in youth are associated with deficits in reward processing and social cognition, a real-life social interaction paradigm using functional neuroimaging (fMRI) has not yet been applied to probe reward processing in such youth. Functional neuroimaging was used to examine the neural correlates of reward-related decision-making during a trust task in two samples of age-matched 11 to 16-year-old boys: with (n = 10) and without (n = 10) externalizing behavior problems. The task required subjects to decide whether to share or keep monetary rewards from partners they themselves identified during a real-life peer sociometric procedure as interpersonally aggressive or kind (vs. neutral). Results supported the notion that prior social and moral information (reputations) modulated reward responses in the adolescent brain. Moreover, boys with externalizing problems showed differential activation in the bilateral insula during the decision phase of the game as well as the caudate and anterior insula during the outcome phase of the game. Similar activation in adolescents in response to reward related stimuli as found in adults suggests some developmental continuity in corticostriatal circuits. Group differences are interpreted with caution given the small group sizes in the current study. Notwithstanding this limitation, the study provides preliminary evidence for anomalous reward responses in boys with externalizing behavior problems, thereby providing a possible biological correlate of well-established social-cognitive and reward-related theories of externalizing behavior disorders.

The serotonin metabolism, especially the 5-HT3 receptor, seems to play an important role. We investigated the effect of the local injection of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist tropisetron on the perception and central processing of pain in FMS patients using painful mechanical stimulation and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) within the framework of a pre-/posttreatment double-blind design. In the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex, contralateral posterior insula, and anterior cingulate cortex, we found that the activation was significantly reduced after treatment. On average, patients rated the stimulation-induced pain intensity as stronger in the session after treatment compared to before treatment, although the individual data revealed a heterogeneous pattern. All patients showed sensitisation during the painful stimulation, which was not influenced by the treatment. Both the sensory-discriminative and motivational-affective components of pain as measured by fMRI were altered by tropisetron. ",
pmid_20034615,Diminished neural processing of aversive and rewarding stimuli during selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment.,,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are popular medications for anxiety and depression, but their effectiveness, particularly in patients with prominent symptoms of loss of motivation and pleasure, has been questioned. There are few studies of the effect of SSRIs on neural reward mechanisms in humans. We studied 45 healthy participants who were randomly allocated to receive the SSRI citalopram, the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor reboxetine, or placebo for 7 days in a double-blind, parallel group design. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure the neural response to rewarding (sight and/or flavor of chocolate) and aversive stimuli (sight of moldy strawberries and/or an unpleasant strawberry taste) on the final day of drug treatment. Citalopram reduced activation to the chocolate stimuli in the ventral striatum and the ventral medial/orbitofrontal cortex. In contrast, reboxetine did not suppress ventral striatal activity and in fact increased neural responses within medial orbitofrontal cortex to reward. Citalopram also decreased neural responses to the aversive stimuli conditions in key ""punishment"" areas such as the lateral orbitofrontal cortex. Reboxetine produced a similar, although weaker effect. Our findings are the first to show that treatment with SSRIs can diminish the neural processing of both rewarding and aversive stimuli. The ability of SSRIs to decrease neural responses to reward might underlie the questioned efficacy of SSRIs in depressive conditions characterized by decreased motivation and anhedonia and could also account for the experience of emotional blunting described by some patients during SSRI treatment.

pmid_20226799,Neural correlates of using distancing to regulate emotional responses to social situations.,,"Cognitive reappraisal is a commonly used and highly adaptive strategy for emotion regulation that has been studied in healthy volunteers. Most studies to date have focused on forms of reappraisal that involve reinterpreting the meaning of stimuli and have intermixed social and non-social emotional stimuli. Here we examined the neural correlates of the regulation of negative emotion elicited by social situations using a less studied form of reappraisal known as distancing. Whole brain fMRI data were obtained as participants viewed aversive and neutral social scenes with instructions to either simply look at and respond naturally to the images or to downregulate their emotional responses by distancing. Three key findings were obtained accompanied with the reduced aversive response behaviorally. First, across both instruction types, aversive social images activated the amygdala. Second, across both image types, distancing activated the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), intraparietal sulci (IPS), and middle/superior temporal gyrus (M/STG). Third, when distancing one's self from aversive images, activity increased in dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), lateral prefrontal cortex, precuneus and PCC, IPS, and M/STG, meanwhile, and decreased in the amygdala. These findings demonstrate that distancing from aversive social cues modulates amygdala activity via engagement of networks implicated in social perception, perspective-taking, and attentional allocation.

pmid_20141299,Minding one's emotions: mindfulness training alters the neural expression of sadness.,,"Recovery from emotional challenge and increased tolerance of negative affect are both hallmarks of mental health. Mindfulness training (MT) has been shown to facilitate these outcomes, yet little is known about its mechanisms of action. The present study employed functional MRI (fMRI) to compare neural reactivity to sadness provocation in participants completing 8 weeks of MT and waitlisted controls. Sadness resulted in widespread recruitment of regions associated with self-referential processes along the cortical midline. Despite equivalent self-reported sadness, MT participants demonstrated a distinct neural response, with greater right-lateralized recruitment, including visceral and somatosensory areas associated with body sensation. The greater somatic recruitment observed in the MT group during evoked sadness was associated with decreased depression scores. Restoring balance between affective and sensory neural networks-supporting conceptual and body based representations of emotion-could be one path through which mindfulness reduces vulnerability to dysphoric reactivity.

pmid_17097071,Affective neural circuitry during facial emotion processing in pediatric bipolar disorder.,,"Facial emotions are central to human interaction. Identifying pathophysiology in affect processing circuitry that supports the ability to assess facial emotions might facilitate understanding of affect regulation in pediatric bipolar disorder. Ten euthymic, unmedicated pediatric bipolar patients and 10 healthy control subjects matched for age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, and IQ were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Angry, happy, and neutral faces were presented in 30-sec blocks, with a 20-sec rest period between blocks. Subjects were asked to press a button when each face appeared, to ensure that attention was maintained on-task. In bipolar patients, in response to both angry and happy faces relative to neutral faces, we observed reduced activation of right rostral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex together with increased activity in right pregenual anterior cingulate, amygdala, and paralimbic cortex. Bipolar patients also showed reduced activation of visual areas in occipital cortex together with greater activation in higher-order visual perceptual areas, including superior temporal sulcus and fusiform gyrus with angry faces and posterior parietal cortex with happy faces. Findings document a disturbance in affective neurocircuitry in pediatric bipolar disorder. Reduced activation in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex might reflect diminished top-down control that leads to the observed exaggerated activation in amygdala and paralimbic areas. Changes in occipital areas might represent an effort to gate sensory input when affective responses to the faces could not be successfully modulated. Disturbances in affect processing circuitry could contribute to emotional dysregulation and social cognitive difficulties in bipolar youth. ",
pmid_27798176,Behavioral and Neural Signatures of Reduced Updating of Alternative Options in Alcohol-Dependent Patients during Flexible Decision-Making.,,"Addicted individuals continue substance use despite the knowledge of harmful consequences and often report having no choice but to consume. Computational psychiatry accounts have linked this clinical observation to difficulties in making flexible and goal-directed decisions in dynamic environments via consideration of potential alternative choices. To probe this in alcohol-dependent patients (n = 43) versus healthy volunteers (n = 35), human participants performed an anticorrelated decision-making task during functional neuroimaging. Via computational modeling, we investigated behavioral and neural signatures of inference regarding the alternative option. While healthy control subjects exploited the anticorrelated structure of the task to guide decision-making, alcohol-dependent patients were relatively better explained by a model-free strategy due to reduced inference on the alternative option after punishment. Whereas model-free prediction error signals were preserved, alcohol-dependent patients exhibited blunted medial prefrontal signatures of inference on the alternative option. This reduction was associated with patients' behavioral deficit in updating the alternative choice option and their obsessive-compulsive drinking habits. All results remained significant when adjusting for potential confounders (e.g., neuropsychological measures and gray matter density). A disturbed integration of alternative choice options implemented by the medial prefrontal cortex appears to be one important explanation for the puzzling question of why addicted individuals continue drug consumption despite negative consequences. In addiction, patients maintain substance use despite devastating consequences and often report having no choice but to consume. These clinical observations have been theoretically linked to disturbed mechanisms of inference, for example, to difficulties when learning statistical regularities of the environmental structure to guide decisions. Using computational modeling, we demonstrate disturbed inference on alternative choice options in alcohol addiction. Patients neglecting ""what might have happened"" was accompanied by blunted coding of inference regarding alternative choice options in the medial prefrontal cortex. An impaired integration of alternative choice options implemented by the medial prefrontal cortex might contribute to ongoing drug consumption in the face of evident negative consequences. ",
pmid_17291727,Mapping brain structure in attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder: a voxel-based MRI study of regional grey and white matter volume.,,"The neuroanatomical basis of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is postulated to involve brain circuitry responsible for attention and executive function. Relatively new automated methods of MRI analysis allow rapid examination of each volume element (voxel) of whole brain, therefore we planned a comprehensive quantitative examination of brain anatomy in children with ADHD using voxel-based methods. We aimed to quantify whole brain, global tissue class and regional grey and white matter volume differences in 28 male children with ADHD and 31 closely matched controls. Since ADHD is often complicated by comorbid oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD), we also conducted post-hoc analyses of subgroups of children with ADHD with and without these comorbidities. Significant regional deficits in ADHD were observed within a predominantly right-sided frontal-pallidal-parietal grey matter network and bilateral white matter tracts. Post-hoc comparisons suggested that comorbid ODD or CD did not greatly alter the extent of regional pathology in ADHD. The exceptions being cerebellar and striatal volume deficits which were significantly greater in children with ADHD plus comorbidities, but not those with ADHD alone, compared to controls. Overall, restricted structural brain abnormalities caused by ADHD were localized to brain systems known to be necessary for attention and executive function. ",

multidelay","Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a well-defined nonmotor manifestation of Parkinson's disease (PD), greatly impairs functioning and quality of life. However, the contribution of cerebral perfusion, quantified by arterial spin labeling (ASL), to MCI in PD remains poorly understood. The selection of an optimal delay time is difficult for single-delay ASL, a problem which is avoided by multidelay ASL. This study uses a multidelay multiparametric ASL to investigate cerebral perfusion including cerebral blood flow (CBF) and arterial transit time (ATT) in early stage PD patients exhibiting MCI using a voxel-based brain analysis. Magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired on a 3.0 T system at rest in 39 early stage PD patients either with MCI (PD-MCI, N = 22) or with normal cognition (PD-N, N = 17), and 36 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs). CBF and ATT were compared among the three groups with SPM using analysis of variance followed by post hoc analyses to define regional differences and examine their relationship to clinical data. PD-MCI showed prolonged ATT in right thalamus compared to both PD-N and HC, and in right supramarginal gyrus compared to HC. PD-N showed shorter ATT in left superior frontal cortex compared to HC. Prolonged ATT in right thalamus was negatively correlated with the category fluency test (p = .027, r = -0.495) in the PD-MCI group. This study shows that ATT may be a more sensitive marker than CBF for the MCI, and highlights the potential role of thalamus and inferior parietal region for MCI in early stage PD. ",
pmid_12912766,Gambling urges in pathological gambling: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study.,,"Gambling urges in pathological gambling (PG) often immediately precede engagement in self-destructive gambling behavior. An improved understanding of the neural correlates of gambling urges in PG would advance our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying PG and would help direct research into effective treatments. Echoplanar functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess brain function during viewing of videotaped scenarios with gambling, happy, or sad content. Participants rated the quality and magnitude of their emotional and motivational responses. Men with PG (n = 10) reported mean +/- SD greater gambling urges after viewing gambling scenarios vs control subjects (n = 11) (5.20 +/- 3.43 vs 0.32 +/- 0.60; chi21,19 = 21.71; P<.001). The groups did not differ significantly in their subjective responses to the happy (P =.56) or sad (P =.81) videotapes. The most pronounced between-group differences in neural activities were observed during the initial period of viewing of the gambling scenarios: PG subjects displayed relatively decreased activity in frontal and orbitofrontal cortex, caudate/basal ganglia, and thalamus compared with controls. Distinct patterns of regional brain activity were observed in specific temporal epochs of videotape viewing. For example, differences localized to the ventral anterior cingulate during the final period of gambling videotape viewing, corresponding to the presentation of the most provocative gambling stimuli. Although group differences in brain activity were observed during viewing of the sad and happy scenarios, they were distinct from those corresponding to the gambling scenarios. In men with PG, gambling cue presentation elicits gambling urges and leads to a temporally dynamic pattern of brain activity changes in frontal, paralimbic, and limbic brain structures. When viewing gambling cues, PG subjects demonstrate relatively decreased activity in brain regions implicated in impulse regulation compared with controls. ",
pmid_20533560,Neuroarchitecture of verbal and tonal working memory in nonmusicians and musicians.,,"Working memory (WM) for auditory information has been thought of as a unitary system, but whether WM for verbal and tonal information relies on the same or different functional neuroarchitectures has remained unknown. This fMRI study examines verbal and tonal WM in both nonmusicians (who are trained in speech, but not in music) and highly trained musicians (who are trained in both domains). The data show that core structures of WM are involved in both tonal and verbal WM (Broca's area, premotor cortex, pre-SMA/SMA, left insular cortex, inferior parietal lobe), although with significantly different structural weightings, in both nonmusicians and musicians. Additionally, musicians activated specific subcomponents only during verbal (right insular cortex) or only during tonal WM (right globus pallidus, right caudate nucleus, and left cerebellum). These results reveal the existence of two WM systems in musicians: A phonological loop supporting rehearsal of phonological information, and a tonal loop supporting rehearsal of tonal information. Differences between groups for tonal WM, and between verbal and tonal WM within musicians, were mainly related to structures involved in controlling, programming and planning of actions, thus presumably reflecting differences in action-related sensorimotor coding of verbal and tonal information.

pmid_17467008,Stability of emotional dysfunctions? A long-term fMRI study in first-episode schizophrenia.,,"Patients with schizophrenia are characterized by emotional symptoms such as flattened affect which are accompanied by cerebral dysfunctions. This study aimed at determining changes of mood-related neural correlates under standardized pharmacological therapy in first-episode schizophrenia. Using fMRI in a longitudinal approach, 10 first-episode schizophrenia patients (6 males) and 10 healthy subjects (same education, gender and age) were investigated during sad and happy mood induction using facial expressions. Reassessments were carried out following 6 months of standardized antipsychotic treatment. Data analysis focussed on therapy-related changes in cerebral activation and on stable, therapy-independent group differences. According to self ratings, mood induction was successful in both groups and did not reveal time-dependent changes. Patients revealed stable hypoactivations in core brain regions of emotional processing like the anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal and temporal areas as well as the hippocampus. Therapy-related signal increases in pre- and postcentral, inferior temporal and frontal areas were restricted to sadness. Stable dysfunctions which are unaffected by therapy and symptom improvement were found in cortico-limbic regions crucially involved in emotion processing. They presumably reflect patients' difficulties in emotion regulation and emotional memory processes. However, therapy-related activation changes were also observed and demonstrate efficacy of antipsychotic therapy on improving emotion functionality. They may represent an increased usage of autobiographic emotional memories and an improved strategy to experience an emotion by mirroring someone else's emotions. ",
pmid_20933374,Changes of brain activation pre- post short-term psychodynamic inpatient psychotherapy: an fMRI study of panic disorder patients.,,"Cognitive-behavioural interventions have been shown to change brain functioning. We used an emotional linguistic go/nogo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) design to determine changes of brain activation patterns of panic disorder (PD) patients following short-term psychodynamic inpatient treatment. Nine PD patients underwent fMRI before and after treatment; 18 healthy controls were scanned twice at the same interval (4 weeks). In the go/nogo design, responses to panic-specific negative words were compared with linguistically matched positive and neutral words. According to hypotheses, patients rated affective words more strongly than controls and selectively recalled negative vs. positive/neutral words. Before treatment, high limbic (hippocampus and amygdala) activation was accompanied by low prefrontal activation to negative words. Inhibition-related activation patterns indicated difficulties of behavioural regulation in emotional context. At treatment termination, panic-related symptoms had improved significantly, and fronto-limbic activation patterns were normalized. Our results indicate that short-term psychodynamic treatment leads to changes in fronto-limbic circuitry not dissimilar to previous findings on cognitive-behavioural treatments. ",
pmid_22038714,Dissociation of brain areas associated with force production and stabilization during manipulation of unstable objects.,,"Multifinger dexterous manipulation of unstable or deformable objects requires control of both direction and magnitude of fingertip force vectors. Our aim was to study the neuroanatomical correlates of these two distinct control functions. Brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging while 16 male subjects (age: 26-42, M = 32, SD ± 4 years) compressed four springs representing a 2 × 2 factorial design with two levels of force and instability requirements. Significant activations associated with higher instability were located bilaterally in the precentral gyri, the postcentral gyrus, and the cerebellum. In the main effect for high force, activity was found in areas located in the primary motor regions contralateral to the active hand and bilaterally in the cerebellum. An overlap in activation between the two main effects was found bilaterally in the cerebellum (lobule VI). This study not only confirms a recently described bilateral fronto-parieto-cerebellar network for manipulation of increasingly unstable objects, but critically extends our understanding by describing its differentiated modulation with both force magnitude and instability requirements. Our results, therefore, expose a previously unrecognized and context-sensitive system of brain regions that enable dexterous manipulation for different force magnitude and instability requirements of the task.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging
Restrained eating
Susceptibility","Many studies have reported that specific susceptibility to food cues plays an important role in disordered eating behavior. However, whether restraint status modulates the neural bases of attentional bias to different types of food cues remains unknown. Thus, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was conducted in individuals (12 restraint eaters, 12 unrestraint eaters) exposed to high/low-energy food and neutral images while performing a two-choice oddball task. The results indicated that restrained eaters responded more quickly to high-energy food images than to neutral and low-energy food images. More notably, compared with unrestrained eaters, restrained eaters showed faster reaction times, hyper-activation in a much wider array of reward (e.g., insula/orbitofrontal cortex), attention (superior frontal gyrus) and visual processing (e.g., superior temporal gyrus) regions, and hypo-activation in cognitive control areas (e.g., anterior cingulate) in response to high-energy food cues. Furthermore, among restrained eaters, the longest reaction times were found for low-energy food images, and activation of the attention and visual-related cortex (e.g., superior parietal gyrus) in the low-neutral contrast condition was significantly stronger than in unrestrained eaters. These findings contribute to our understanding of susceptibility to food cues: in addition to the special sensitivity (attentional bias) to high-energy food images, restrained eaters may also be more sensitive (allocate more attentional resources) to low-energy food images. These potential neural bases of restrained eaters may help clarify why dieting to lose or maintain weight is so often unsuccessful. ",

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
Tension-type headache","In this study, we aimed to investigate the spontaneous neural activity in the conventional frequency band (0.01-0.08 Hz) and two sub-frequency bands (slow-4: 0.027-0.073 Hz, and slow-5: 0.01-0.027 Hz) in tension-type headache (TTH) patients with regional homogeneity (ReHo) analyses. Thirty-eight TTH patients and thirty-eight healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) scanning to investigate abnormal spontaneous neural activity using ReHo analysis in conventional frequency band (0.01-0.08 Hz) and two sub-frequency bands (slow-4: 0.027-0.073 Hz and slow-5: 0.01-0.027 Hz). In comparison with the HC group, patients with TTH exhibited ReHo increases in the right medial superior frontal gyrus in the conventional frequency band (0.01-0.08 Hz). The between group differences in the slow-5 band (0.01-0.027 Hz) highly resembled the differences in the conventional frequency band (0.01-0.08 Hz); even the voxels with increased ReHo were spatially more extensive, including the right medial superior frontal gyrus and the middle frontal gyrus. In contrast, no region showed significant between-group differences in the slow-4 band (0.027-0.073 Hz). The correlation analyses showed no correlation between the ReHo values in TTH patients and VAS scores, course of disease and number of seizures per month in conventional band (0.01-0.08 Hz), slow-4 band (0.027-0.073 Hz), as well as in slow-5 band (0.01-0.027 Hz). The results showed that the superior frontal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus were involved in the integration and processing of pain signals. In addition, the abnormal spontaneous neural activity in TTH patients was frequency-specific. Namely, slow-5 band (0.01-0.027 Hz) might contain additional useful information in comparison to slow-4 band (0.027-0.073 Hz). This preliminary exploration might provide an objective imaging basis for the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism of TTH. ",
pmid_18996542,Brain activities associated with gaming urge of online gaming addiction.,,"The aim of this study was to identify the neural substrates of online gaming addiction through evaluation of the brain areas associated with the cue-induced gaming urge. Ten participants with online gaming addiction and 10 control subjects without online gaming addiction were tested. They were presented with gaming pictures and the paired mosaic pictures while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. The contrast in blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signals when viewing gaming pictures and when viewing mosaic pictures was calculated with the SPM2 software to evaluate the brain activations. Right orbitofrontal cortex, right nucleus accumbens, bilateral anterior cingulate and medial frontal cortex, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and right caudate nucleus were activated in the addicted group in contrast to the control group. The activation of the region-of-interest (ROI) defined by the above brain areas was positively correlated with self-reported gaming urge and recalling of gaming experience provoked by the WOW pictures. The results demonstrate that the neural substrate of cue-induced gaming urge/craving in online gaming addiction is similar to that of the cue-induced craving in substance dependence. The above-mentioned brain regions have been reported to contribute to the craving in substance dependence, and here we show that the same areas were involved in online gaming urge/craving. Thus, the results suggest that the gaming urge/craving in online gaming addiction and craving in substance dependence might share the same neurobiological mechanism. ",
pmid_15949507,Temporal dynamics of cerebro-cerebellar network recruitment during a cognitive task.,,"Previous investigations have demonstrated that two regions in the right cerebellum, one located superiorly in hemispheral lobule VI/Crus I and another located inferiorly in hemispheral lobule VIIB/VIIIA, are activated during verbal working memory performance. On the basis of functional neuroimaging patterns of activation, as well as known cortico-pontine and ponto-cerebellar projections, the superior region has been hypothesized to contribute to the articulatory control system of working memory whereas the inferior region has been linked to the phonological store. The present study used event-related fMRI and individual estimates of hemodynamic response for both the cerebellum and neocortex to test this model and characterize the task phase specific cerebro-cerebellar activations for a Sternberg verbal working memory task. Results demonstrated that the right superior cerebellum showed the strongest activation during the initial encoding phase of the task, and, consistent with predictions, a similar pattern was observed in left opercular inferior frontal and premotor regions. In contrast, the right inferior cerebellum exhibited the greatest activation during the maintenance phase of the task, and as predicted, corresponded with activation in the left inferior parietal lobule. The significance of the results with respect to cerebro-cerebellar models of verbal working memory and to theoretical accounts of cerebellar involvement in cognition is discussed. ",
pmid_22319604,Dorsal striatum and its limbic connectivity mediate abnormal anticipatory reward processing in obesity.,,"Obesity is characterized by an imbalance in the brain circuits promoting reward seeking and those governing cognitive control. Here we show that the dorsal caudate nucleus and its connections with amygdala, insula and prefrontal cortex contribute to abnormal reward processing in obesity. We measured regional brain glucose uptake in morbidly obese (n = 19) and normal weighted (n = 16) subjects with 2-[¹⁸F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ([¹⁸F]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) during euglycemic hyperinsulinemia and with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while anticipatory food reward was induced by repeated presentations of appetizing and bland food pictures. First, we found that glucose uptake rate in the dorsal caudate nucleus was higher in obese than in normal-weight subjects. Second, obese subjects showed increased hemodynamic responses in the caudate nucleus while viewing appetizing versus bland foods in fMRI. The caudate also showed elevated task-related functional connectivity with amygdala and insula in the obese versus normal-weight subjects. Finally, obese subjects had smaller responses to appetizing versus bland foods in the dorsolateral and orbitofrontal cortices than did normal-weight subjects, and failure to activate the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was correlated with high glucose metabolism in the dorsal caudate nucleus. These findings suggest that enhanced sensitivity to external food cues in obesity may involve abnormal stimulus-response learning and incentive motivation subserved by the dorsal caudate nucleus, which in turn may be due to abnormally high input from the amygdala and insula and dysfunctional inhibitory control by the frontal cortical regions. These functional changes in the responsiveness and interconnectivity of the reward circuit could be a critical mechanism to explain overeating in obesity. ",
pmid_22503728,Resting-state abnormal baseline brain activity in unipolar and bipolar depression.,,"In the present study, we investigated differences in resting-state brain activity in patients with bipolar depression (BD) and unipolar depression (UD) by measuring the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals. Twenty-one BD and 21 gender-, age-, and education-matched UD patients participated in the fMRI analysis. We compared the differences in the ALFF between the two groups and investigated the correlation between clinical measurements and ALFF in the regions displaying significant group differences. BD subjects displayed significantly decreased ALFF in the left superior parietal lobule and the left posterior insula (l-PI). They also displayed increased ALFF in the right dorsal anterior insula (r-dAI) when compared to the UD group. Moderate negative correlations were found between the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score (HAMD) and the ALFF in the l-PI for the BD (r=-0.44, P=0.02) and UD (r=-0.45, P=0.02) groups. Our results support the notion that insular subregions may contribute to the precise differentiation between BD and UD. ",
pmid_19849880,Differential engagement of cognitive and affective neural systems in pediatric bipolar disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.,,"This fMRI study investigates the neural bases of cognitive control of emotion processing in pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Seventeen un-medicated PBD patients, 15 un-medicated ADHD patients, and 14 healthy controls (HC) (mean age = 13.78 +/- 2.47) performed an emotional valence Stroop Task, requiring them to match the color of an emotionally valenced word to the color of either of two adjacent circles. Both patient groups responded significantly slower than HC, but there were no group differences in accuracy. A voxel-wise analysis of variance on brain activation revealed a significant interaction of group by word valence [F(2,41) = 4.44; p = .02]. Similar group differences were found for negative and positive words. For negative versus neutral words, both patient groups exhibited greater activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and parietal cortex relative to HC. The PBD group exhibited greater activation in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) relative to HC. The ADHD group exhibited decreased VLPFC activation relative to HC and the PBD group. During cognitive control of emotion processing, PBD patients deployed the VLPFC to a greater extent than HC. The ADHD patients showed decreased VLPFC engagement relative to both HC and PBD patients. ",
pmid_27065490,"From ""Where"" to ""What"": Distributed Representations of Brand Associations in the Human Brain.",,"Considerable attention has been given to the notion that there exists a set of human-like characteristics associated with brands, referred to as brand personality. Here we combine newly available machine learning techniques with functional neuroimaging data to characterize the set of processes that give rise to these associations. We show that brand personality traits can be captured by the weighted activity across a widely distributed set of brain regions previously implicated in reasoning, imagery, and affective processing. That is, as opposed to being constructed via reflective processes, brand personality traits appear to exist a priori inside the minds of consumers, such that we were able to predict what brand a person is thinking about based solely on the relationship between brand personality associations and brain activity. These findings represent an important advance in the application of neuroscientific methods to consumer research, moving from work focused on cataloguing brain regions associated with marketing stimuli to testing and refining mental constructs central to theories of consumer behavior.

There is little known about whether ApoE affects caudate in mild CI of PD (PD-MCI). We investigated the possible interactive effect of ApoE genotypes on caudate functional connectivity (FC) in PD-MCI. A total of 95 PD-MCI patients and 99 matched healthy controls underwent extensive neuropsychological assessment and magnetic resonance imaging. The two groups were separated into three subgroups according to their genotyping. Functional data were analyzed with FC analysis. Decreased FC between the caudate and the bilateral inferior orbit frontal gyrus and bilateral middle occipital gyrus (MOG) was found between groups, along with poor performance in general, executive, episodic memory, language, and visual-spatial function. Decreased FC between the caudate and right MOG, right middle temporal gyrus, and right superior occipital gyrus was found as an interaction effect. The FC values of ε4 carriers with PD-MCI were much lower than the other carriers, and FC was positively correlated with the impairment of global and language function. These results support the idea that altered FC between the bilateral caudate and posterior cortical regions was interactively influenced by ApoE genotype and PD-MCI status, and the ε4 subtype associated with underlying pathology of global cognitive decline and semantic fluency impairment in an interactive manner. Gene-based imaging approaches might strengthen the credibility in imaging genetic associations, which might provide new powerful insights into the neural mechanisms underlying PD-MCI. ",
pmid_23119084,"Amplitude of low-frequency oscillations in first-episode, treatment-naive patients with major depressive disorder: a resting-state functional MRI study.",,"Resting-state fMRI is a novel approach to measure spontaneous brain activity in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Although most resting-state fMRI studies have focused on the examination of temporal correlations between low-frequency oscillations (LFOs), few studies have explored the amplitude of these LFOs in MDD. In this study, we applied the approaches of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and fractional ALFF to examine the amplitude of LFOs in MDD. A total of 36 subjects, 18 first-episode, treatment-naive patients with MDD matched with 18 healthy controls (HCs) completed the fMRI scans. Compared with HCs, MDD patients showed increased ALFF in the right fusiform gyrus and the right anterior and posterior lobes of the cerebellum but decreased ALFF in the left inferior temporal gyrus, bilateral inferior parietal lobule, and right lingual gyrus. The fALFF in patients was significantly increased in the right precentral gyrus, right inferior temporal gyrus, bilateral fusiform gyrus, and bilateral anterior and posterior lobes of the cerebellum but was decreased in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral medial orbitofrontal cortex, bilateral middle temporal gyrus, left inferior temporal gyrus, and right inferior parietal lobule. After taking gray matter (GM) volume as a covariate, the results still remained. These findings indicate that MDD patients have altered LFO amplitude in a number of regions distributed over the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cortices and the cerebellum. These aberrant regions may be related to the disturbances of multiple emotion- and cognition-related networks observed in MDD and the apparent heterogeneity in depressive symptom domains. Such brain functional alteration of MDD may contribute to further understanding of MDD-related network imbalances demonstrated in previous fMRI studies. ",
pmid_12217968,Brain activity underlying encoding and retrieval of source memory.,,"Neural activity elicited during the encoding and retrieval of source information was investigated with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (efMRI). During encoding, 17 subjects performed a natural/artificial judgement on pictures of common objects which were presented randomly in one of the four quadrants of the display. At retrieval, old pictures were mixed with new ones and subjects judged whether each picture was new or old and, if old, indicated in which quadrant it was presented at encoding. During encoding, study items that were later recognized and assigned a correct source judgement elicited greater activity than recognized items given incorrect judgements in a variety of regions, including right lateral occipital and left prefrontal cortex. At retrieval, regions showing greater activity for recognized items given correct versus incorrect source judgements included the right hippocampal formation and the left prefrontal cortex. These findings indicate a role for these regions in the encoding and retrieval of episodic information beyond that required for simple item recognition. ",

impulsivity
naltrexone","Identifying key neural substrates in addiction disorders for targeted drug development remains a major challenge for clinical neuroscience. One emerging target is the opioid system, where substance-dependent populations demonstrate prefrontal opioid dysregulation that predicts impulsivity and relapse. This may suggest that disturbances to the prefrontal opioid system could confer a risk for relapse in addiction due to weakened 'top-down' control over impulsive behaviour. Naltrexone is currently licensed for alcohol dependence and is also used clinically for impulse control disorders. Using a go/no-go (GNG) task, we examined the effects of acute naltrexone on the neural correlates of successful motor impulse control in abstinent alcoholics (AUD), abstinent polysubstance-dependent (poly-SUD) individuals and controls during a randomised double blind placebo controlled fMRI study. In the absence of any differences on GNG task performance, the AUD group showed a significantly greater BOLD response compared to the control group in lateral and medial prefrontal regions during both placebo and naltrexone treatments; effects that were positively correlated with alcohol abstinence. There was also a dissociation in the positive modulating effects of naltrexone in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and anterior insula cortex (AIC) of the AUD and poly-SUD groups respectively. Self-reported trait impulsivity in the poly-SUD group also predicted the effect of naltrexone in the AIC. These results suggest that acute naltrexone differentially amplifies neural responses within two distinct regions of a salience network during successful motor impulse control in abstinent AUD and poly-SUD groups, which are predicted by trait impulsivity in the poly-SUD group.

pmid_23199001,Association of the interleukin 1 beta gene and brain spontaneous activity in amnestic mild cognitive impairment.,,"The inflammatory response has been associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The purpose of this study is to determine whether the rs1143627 polymorphism of the interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) gene moderates functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-measured brain regional activity in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Eighty older participants (47 with aMCI and 33 healthy controls) were recruited for this study. All of the participants were genotyped for variant rs1143627 in the IL1B gene and were scanned using resting-state fMRI. Brain activity was assessed by amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF). aMCI patients had abnormal ALFF in many brain regions, including decreases in the inferior frontal gyrus, the superior temporal lobe and the middle temporal lobe, and increases in the occipital cortex (calcarine), parietal cortex (Pcu) and cerebellar cortex. The regions associated with an interaction of group X genotypes of rs1143627 C/T were the parietal cortex (left Pcu), frontal cortex (left superior, middle, and medial gyrus, right anterior cingulum), occipital cortex (left middle lobe, left cuneus) and the bilateral posterior lobes of the cerebellum. Regarding the behavioral significance, there were significant correlations between ALFF in different regions of the brain and with the cognitive scores of each genotype group. The present study provided evidence that aMCI patients had abnormal ALFF in many brain regions. Specifically, the rs1143627 C/T polymorphism of the IL1B gene may modulate regional spontaneous brain activity in aMCI patients. ",
pmid_11931290,Hemispheric asymmetry reduction in older adults: the HAROLD model.,,"A model of the effects of aging on brain activity during cognitive performance is introduced. The model is called HAROLD (hemispheric asymmetry reduction in older adults), and it states that, under similar circumstances, prefrontal activity during cognitive performances tends to be less lateralized in older adults than in younger adults. The model is supported by functional neuroimaging and other evidence in the domains of episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, perception, and inhibitory control. Age-related hemispheric asymmetry reductions may have a compensatory function or they may reflect a dedifferentiation process. They may have a cognitive or neural origin, and they may reflect regional or network mechanisms. The HAROLD model is a cognitive neuroscience model that integrates ideas and findings from psychology and neuroscience of aging. ",

state–trait anxiety inventory
trait anxiety
visual perception","Trait anxiety, the disposition to experience anxiety, is known to facilitate perception of threats. Trait anxious individuals seem to identify threatening stimuli such as fearful facial expressions more accurately, especially when presented under temporal constraints. In past studies on anxiety and emotion face recognition, only self-report or explicit measures of anxiety have been administered. Implicit measures represent indirect tests allowing to circumvent problems associated with self-report. In our study, we made use of implicit in addition to explicit measures to investigate the relationships of trait anxiety with recognition of and brain response to emotional faces. 75 healthy young volunteers had to identify briefly presented (67 ms) fearful, angry, happy, and neutral facial expressions masked by neutral faces while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. The Implicit Association Test, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Beck Anxiety Inventory were applied as implicit and explicit measures of trait anxiety. After corrections for multiple testing, neither implicitly nor explicitly measured anxiety correlated with recognition of emotional facial expressions. Moreover, implicitly and explicitly assessed anxiety was not linked to brain response to emotional faces. Our data suggest links between discrimination accuracy and brain response to facial emotions. Activation of the caudate nucleus seems be of particular importance for recognizing fear and happiness from facial expressions. Processes of somatosensory resonance appear to be involved in identifying fear from facial expressions. The present data indicate that, regardless of assessment method, trait anxiety does not affect the recognition of fear or other emotions as has been proposed previously. ",
pmid_22110619,Music and emotions in the brain: familiarity matters.,,"The importance of music in our daily life has given rise to an increased number of studies addressing the brain regions involved in its appreciation. Some of these studies controlled only for the familiarity of the stimuli, while others relied on pleasantness ratings, and others still on musical preferences. With a listening test and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, we wished to clarify the role of familiarity in the brain correlates of music appreciation by controlling, in the same study, for both familiarity and musical preferences. First, we conducted a listening test, in which participants rated the familiarity and liking of song excerpts from the pop/rock repertoire, allowing us to select a personalized set of stimuli per subject. Then, we used a passive listening paradigm in fMRI to study music appreciation in a naturalistic condition with increased ecological value. Brain activation data revealed that broad emotion-related limbic and paralimbic regions as well as the reward circuitry were significantly more active for familiar relative to unfamiliar music. Smaller regions in the cingulate cortex and frontal lobe, including the motor cortex and Broca's area, were found to be more active in response to liked music when compared to disliked one. Hence, familiarity seems to be a crucial factor in making the listeners emotionally engaged with music, as revealed by fMRI data. ",
pmid_20855051,Emotion processing influences working memory circuits in pediatric bipolar disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.,,"This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study examined how working memory circuits are affected by face emotion processing in pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A total of 23 patients with PBD, 14 patients with ADHD, and 19 healthy control (HC) subjects (mean age, 13.36 ± 2.55 years) underwent an affective, two-back fMRI task with blocks of happy, angry, and neutral faces. For angry versus neutral faces PBD patients, relative to ADHD patients, exhibited increased activation in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and orbitofrontal cortex, and reduced activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and premotor cortex. Relative to the HC group, the PBD group showed no increased activation and reduced activation at the junction of DLPFC and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). Relative to HC, the ADHD patients exhibited greater activation in the DLPFC and reduced activation in the ventral and medial PFC, pregenual ACC, striatum, and temporo-parietal regions. For happy versus neutral faces, relative to the ADHD group, the PBD group exhibited greater activation in the bilateral caudate, and relative to the HC group the ADHD group showed increased activation in the DLPFC, striatal, and parietal regions, and no reduced activation. The ADHD group, compared with the HC group, showed no reduced activation and increased activation in regions that were underactive for the angry face condition. Relative to the ADHD group, the PBD group exhibited greater deployment of the emotion-processing circuitry and reduced deployment of working memory circuitry. Commonalities across PBD and ADHD patients, relative to the HC individuals, entailed cortico-subcortical activity that was reduced under negative emotional challenge and increased under positive emotional challenge.

pmid_11209939,Disrupted neural responses to phonological and orthographic processing in dyslexic children: an fMRI study.,,"Developmental dyslexia, characterized by difficulty in reading, has been associated with phonological and orthographic processing deficits. fMRI was performed on dyslexic and normal-reading children (8-12 years old) during phonological and orthographic tasks of rhyming and matching visually presented letter pairs. During letter rhyming, both normal and dyslexic reading children had activity in left frontal brain regions, whereas only normal-reading children had activity in left temporo-parietal cortex. During letter matching, normal-reading children showed activity throughout extrastriate cortex, especially in occipito-parietal regions, whereas dyslexic children had little activity in extrastriate cortex during this task. These results indicate dyslexia may be characterized in childhood by disruptions in the neural bases of both phonological and orthographic processes important for reading. ",
pmid_24821143,Prolonged repeated acupuncture stimulation induces habituation effects in pain-related brain areas: an FMRI study.,,"Most previous studies of brain responses to acupuncture were designed to investigate the acupuncture instant effect while the cumulative effect that should be more important in clinical practice has seldom been discussed. In this study, the neural basis of the acupuncture cumulative effect was analyzed. For this experiment, forty healthy volunteers were recruited, in which more than 40 minutes of repeated acupuncture stimulation was implemented at acupoint Zhusanli (ST36). Three runs of acupuncture fMRI datasets were acquired, with each run consisting of two blocks of acupuncture stimulation. Besides general linear model (GLM) analysis, the cumulative effects of acupuncture were analyzed with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to find the association between the brain response and the cumulative duration of acupuncture stimulation in each stimulation block. The experimental results showed that the brain response in the initial stage was the strongest although the brain response to acupuncture was time-variant. In particular, the brain areas that were activated in the first block and the brain areas that demonstrated cumulative effects in the course of repeated acupuncture stimulation overlapped in the pain-related areas, including the bilateral middle cingulate cortex, the bilateral paracentral lobule, the SII, and the right thalamus. Furthermore, the cumulative effects demonstrated bimodal characteristics, i.e. the brain response was positive at the beginning, and became negative at the end. It was suggested that the cumulative effect of repeated acupuncture stimulation was consistent with the characteristic of habituation effects. This finding may explain the neurophysiologic mechanism underlying acupuncture analgesia. ",
pmid_14550677,Neural abnormalities during cognitive generation of affect in treatment-resistant depression.,,"Dysfunctions in brain regions known to be involved in affect and mood states are thought to be implicated in depression and may have a role in determining the type and symptoms of this illness. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to elucidate neural correlates of cognitive generation of affect, using a previously published paradigm of evoking affect with picture-caption pairs, in patients with unipolar, treatment-resistant depression. Compared with control participants, patients showed relatively decreased response in the anterior cingulate (rostral; right) with both negative and positive picture-caption pairs and in the medial frontal gyrus and hippocampus (all left) with positive picture-caption pairs. They demonstrated increased response in the inferior (right) and middle temporal gyri (left) with negative picture-caption pairs, and in the parahippocampal gyrus (right), inferior frontal gyrus (left), subgenual cingulate (right), striatum (right), and brain stem (left) with positive picture-caption pairs. Reduced medial/middle prefrontal and hippocampal activity may account for positive affect disturbances and temporal lobe hyperactivity for negative affect disturbances in treatment-resistant depression. The results also corroborate previous observations from resting positron emission tomography studies and further elucidate the association between hypoactive rostral cingulate and nonresponsiveness to treatment in depression.

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 14 CM patients treated with longitudinal pre- and postacupuncture treatment (PPAT) and data of 18 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA) and seed-based correlation analysis (SCA) to investigate connectivity within the DMN. Correlation analyses were performed to identify associations between changes in functional connectivity (FC) and in clinical pain based on PPAT observations. The monthly mean visual analog scale (VAS) scores, monthly mean headache attacks, monthly headache days, monthly amount of acute headache medications, and immediate VAS scores were assessed for evaluation of pain. The decreased FC within the DMN found in the left superior prefrontal gyrus (L_SPFG) and left precuneus (L_PRECUN) of CM patients was returned to the healthy control level after acupuncture treatments. Furthermore, the diminished pairwise FC strengths in some regions of interest (ROIs) within the DMN were also increased, mainly distributed between the right temporal lobe (R_TPL) and left anterior cingulate cortex, between the R_TPL and bilateral superior medial gyrus, and between the R_TPL and right precuneus. Increased  Altered DMN connectivity and its normalization postacupuncture can be employed to monitor CM and its modulating effects. The DMN is useful for understanding the therapeutic mechanisms of acupuncture in CM. ",

social influence","Decades of research have demonstrated the importance of social influence in initiation and maintenance of drug use, but little is known about neural mechanisms underlying social influence in young adults who use recreational drugs. To better understand whether the neural and/or behavioral response to social influence differs in young adults using illicit drugs, 20 marijuana-using young adults (MJ) aged 18-25, and 20 controls (CON) performed a decision-making task in the context of social influence, while they underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. A priori analyses focused on the nucleus accumbens (NAc), with post hoc analyses in the rest of the striatum. In this task, participants could choose to either follow or go against group influence. When subjects applied social information to response choice selection (independent of following or going against group influence), we observed activation in the middle striatum (caudate), in the MJ group only, that extended ventrally into the NAc. MJ users but not CON showed greater activation in the NAc but not the caudate while making choices congruent with group influence as opposed to choices going against group influence. Activation in the NAc when following social influence was associated with amount of drug use reported. In contrast, during the feedback phase of the task we observed significant NAc activation in both MJ and CON, along with dorsal caudate activation only in MJ participants. This NAc activation did not correlate with drug use. This study shows that MJ users, but not CON, show differential brain activation across striatal subregions when applying social information to make a decision, following versus going against a group of peers, or receiving positive feedback. The current work suggests that differential neural sensitivity to social influence in regions such as the striatum may contribute to the development and/or maintenance of marijuana use. ",
pmid_26436313,Investigating the phenomenological matrix of mindfulness-related practices from a neurocognitive perspective.,,"There has been a great increase in literature concerned with the effects of a variety of mental training regimes that generally fall within what might be called contemplative practices, and a majority of these studies have focused on mindfulness. Mindfulness meditation practices can be conceptualized as a set of attention-based, regulatory, and self-inquiry training regimes cultivated for various ends, including wellbeing and psychological health. This article examines the construct of mindfulness in psychological research and reviews recent, nonclinical work in this area. Instead of proposing a single definition of mindfulness, we interpret it as a continuum of practices involving states and processes that can be mapped into a multidimensional phenomenological matrix which itself can be expressed in a neurocognitive framework. This phenomenological matrix of mindfulness is presented as a heuristic to guide formulation of next-generation research hypotheses from both cognitive/behavioral and neuroscientific perspectives. In relation to this framework, we review selected findings on mindfulness cultivated through practices in traditional and research settings, and we conclude by identifying significant gaps in the literature and outline new directions for research.

pmid_17921372,Effects of overfeeding on the neuronal response to visual food cues.,,"The regulation of energy intake is a complex process involving the integration of homeostatic signals and both internal and external sensory inputs. Environmental visual cues are one of the first and primary inputs signaling the potential availability of food. We examined the effects of short-term overfeeding on the neuronal responses to food-related visual stimuli in thin individuals. Twenty-five thin individuals (13 women, 12 men) were studied. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed after 2 days of eucaloric energy intake and after 2 days of 30% overfeeding in a counterbalanced design. fMRI was performed while the subjects were presented with visual stimuli in 3 different categories: neutral control objects, foods of neutral hedonic value, and foods of high hedonic value. Measures of appetite were obtained by using visual analogue scales before and after meals. In the eucaloric state, pictures of foods of high hedonic value elicited greater activation of neuronal regions than did neutrally rated foods, which is consistent with visual processing and attention (inferior temporal visual cortex, posterior parietal cortex, premotor cortex, and hippocampus) and with activation of the hypothalamus. Two days of overfeeding led to significant attenuation of these responses. Overfeeding also resulted in reduced hunger ratings and increased satiety ratings. These findings emphasize the important role of external food-related visual cues and suggest that there are interactions between external visual sensory inputs, energy balance status, and brain regions important in the homeostatic regulation of energy intake.

pmid_22479499,Thinking about eating food activates visual cortex with reduced bilateral cerebellar activation in females with anorexia nervosa: an fMRI study.,,"Women with anorexia nervosa (AN) have aberrant cognitions about food and altered activity in prefrontal cortical and somatosensory regions to food images. However, differential effects on the brain when thinking about eating food between healthy women and those with AN is unknown. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) examined neural activation when 42 women thought about eating the food shown in images: 18 with AN (11 RAN, 7 BPAN) and 24 age-matched controls (HC). Group contrasts between HC and AN revealed reduced activation in AN in the bilateral cerebellar vermis, and increased activation in the right visual cortex. Preliminary comparisons between AN subtypes and healthy controls suggest differences in cortical and limbic regions. These preliminary data suggest that thinking about eating food shown in images increases visual and prefrontal cortical neural responses in females with AN, which may underlie cognitive biases towards food stimuli and ruminations about controlling food intake. Future studies are needed to explicitly test how thinking about eating activates restraint cognitions, specifically in those with restricting vs. binge-purging AN subtypes. ",
pmid_20411397,Development of neural correlates of empathy from childhood to early adulthood: an fMRI study in boys and adult men.,,"Although empathy is rooted early in life, the ability to understand and share the emotions of others continues to develop after childhood. Here, we aimed at exploring developmental changes in the neural mechanisms underlying empathy from childhood to early adulthood. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, 47 healthy male subjects aged 8-27 years were investigated during an explicit empathy task. Emotional faces were presented and participants were either asked to infer the emotional state from the face (other-task) or to judge their own emotional response to the face (self-task). A perceptual decision on the width of faces was used as a control condition. Age-related activity increases were observed in the fusiform gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus, depending on whether subjects attributed emotions to self or other. During the self-task, activity in the right precuneus and right intraparietal sulcus decreased as a function of age. No age-related differences were observed in behavioral performance measures. Increased activity in the fusiform gyrus and in the frontal component of the human mirror neuron system with increasing age may be explained by greater experience and expertise accumulated during socio-emotional interactions. Greater recruitment of right parietal structures in younger as compared to older subjects might reflect developmental differences in the cognitive strategies to infer one's own emotional response. This study is the first to show developmental changes in the neural mechanisms supporting empathy. Our findings may have important implications for the development of novel therapeutic interventions in clinical conditions characterized by empathy deficits, such as autism spectrum disorder. ",

resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging","Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered to be the clinical transition stage between patients with cognitively intact geriatrics and Alzheimer's disease (AD). When observed longitudinally, however, a certain proportion of patients with MCI are expected to revert to a cognitively intact state (MCI_R) while others either remain in the MCI state (MCI_S) or deteriorate into AD (MCI_P). It is worthwhile to investigate the divergence in the brain activities of these MCI groups with different post hoc labels. In this study, we employed the regional homogeneity (ReHo) measure to explore the characteristics of local brain activity in these MCI groups. Compared to age-matched normal controls, our results exhibited that (1) in MCI_R group, ReHo index showed an increase in the left insula and a decrease in the left superior temporal gyrus; (2) in MCI_S group, ReHo index increased in the left orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG_orb) and decreased in the left inferior parietal lobe; and (3) in MCI_P group, ReHo index elevated in the left IFG_orb and decreased in the left putamen. The distinct ReHo changes in the individual MCI groups indicated a potential evidence for differentially active interventions for a specific patient with MCI. ",

The objective of this study was to investigate both intra- and inter-regional resting-state connectivity within the central executive network in OCD. Thirty OCD patients and 30 matched healthy controls were scanned using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The independent component analysis was used on a separate sample of healthy controls to generate the central executive network mask for the subsequent OCD analyses. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) and seed-based functional connectivity analyses were used to explore the differences between intra- and inter-regional synchronized activity within the central executive network in OCD patients at rest. Increased ReHo and functional connectivity in the key regions of the central executive network, such as the orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the angular gyrus, were found in OCD patients. Furthermore, changes in both the ReHo within the orbitofrontal cortex and the functional connectivity between the orbitofrontal cortex and angular gyrus were negatively correlated with OCD duration. The increased resting-state functional organization within the central executive network may be related to OCD patients' deficits in cognitive control and symptom progression. ",
pmid_8624678,Noun and verb retrieval by normal subjects. Studies with PET.,,"PET activation studies identify significant local changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in contrasts of behavioural tasks with control states, and these local changes identify net changes in local synaptic activity. A number of studies on word retrieval have all demonstrated left frontal (dorsolateral and medial) involvement in the task. However, there have been differences in the responses observed in the left temporal lobe, with variously a deactivation (significant decrease in rCBF), no response and an activation (significant increase in rCBF). In the four studies described here, we have examined word (verbs and nouns) retrieval contrasted with a number of different control states. The studies confirmed extensive activation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and, medially, the anterior cingulate cortex and the supplementary motor area (SMA). Activations of the left posterior temporal lobe and the inferior parietal lobe were consistently demonstrated when word retrieval was contrasted with a rest state. Contrasts with other single word tasks controlled out the activation in the perisylvian part of the left posterior temporal lobe, suggesting a role for this region in lexical processing. The left inferolateral temporal cortex and the posterior part of the inferior parietal lobe were only activated by word retrieval, particularly verbs. It is proposed that these activated regions reflect access to semantic fields. ",

This study aimed to investigate the potential endophenotypes of brain activation and performance in inhibitory control and visual processing among ADHD probands, their unaffected siblings, and neurotypical youths. We assessed 27 ADHD probands, 27 unaffected siblings, and 27 age-, gender-, and IQ-matched neurotypical youths using the counting Stroop functional magnetic resonance imaging and two tasks of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB): rapid visual information processing (RVP) for inhibitory control and spatial span (SSP) for visual processing. ADHD probands showed greater activation than their unaffected siblings and neurotypical youths in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and anterior cingulate cortex. Increased activation in the right IFG was positively correlated with the mean latency of the RVP in ADHD probands. Moreover, ADHD probands and their unaffected siblings showed less activation in the left superior parietal lobule (SPL) than neurotypical youths. Increased activation in the left SPL was positively correlated with the spatial length of the SSP in neurotypical youths. Our findings suggest that less activation in the left SPL might be considered as a candidate imaging endophenotype for visual processing in ADHD. ",
pmid_28785029,Neural correlates of proactive and reactive motor response inhibition of gambling stimuli in frequent gamblers.,,"We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine whether motivational-salient cues could exert a differential impact on proactive (the restrain of actions in preparation for stopping) and reactive (outright stopping) inhibition. Fourteen high-frequency poker players, and 14 matched non-gambler controls, performed a modified version of the stop-signal paradigm, which required participants to inhibit categorization of poker or neutral pictures. The probability that a stop-signal occurs (0%, 17%, 25%, 33%) was manipulated across blocks of trials, as indicated by the color of the computer screen. Behavioral analyses revealed that poker players were faster than controls in categorizing pictures across all levels of proactive motor response inhibition (go trials). Brain imaging analyses highlighted higher dorsal anterior cingulate cortex activation in poker players, as compared to controls, during reactive inhibition. These findings suggest that, due to their faster rates of stimulus discrimination, poker players might have recruited more cognitive resources than controls when required to stop their response (reactive inhibition). Nevertheless, no main effect of stimulus type was found, on either proactive or reactive inhibition. Additional studies are, therefore, needed in order to confirm that investigating the dynamics between reactive and proactive inhibition offers a discriminative analysis of inhibitory control toward motivational-salient cues. ",
pmid_16249098,Neural correlates of regulating negative emotions related to moral violations.,,"Previous neuroimaging studies have identified several brain regions associated with regulating emotional responses. Different kinds of emotional stimuli, however, may recruit different regulatory processes and, in turn, recruit different regions. We compared emotion regulation for two types of negative emotional stimuli: those involving moral violations (moral stimuli), and those not involving moral violations (non-moral stimuli). In addition, we investigated whether activation in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), a region implicated previously in specifically moral processing, may instead reflect greater social and emotional content. Ten female subjects were scanned using fMRI while they passively viewed or were instructed to decrease emotional reactions to moral and non-moral pictures closely matched on social and emotional content. Passive viewing of both picture types elicited similar activations in areas related to the processing of social and emotional content, including MPFC and amygdala. During regulation, different patterns of activation in these regions were observed for moral vs. non-moral pictures. These results suggest that the neural correlates of regulating emotional reactions are modulated by the emotional content of stimuli, such as moral violations. In addition, the current findings suggest that some brain regions previously implicated in moral processing reflect the processing of greater social and emotional content in moral stimuli. ",
pmid_17689268,"Human cortical representations for reaching: mirror neurons for execution, observation, and imagery.",,"We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the cortical representations of executed reaching, observed reaching, and imagined reaching in humans. Whereas previous studies have mostly examined hand actions related to grasping, hand-object interactions, or local finger movements, here we were interested in reaching only (i.e. the transport phase of the hand to a particular location in space), without grasping. We hypothesized that mirror neuron areas specific to reaching-related representations would be active in all three conditions. An overlap between executed, observed, and imagined reaching activations was found in dorsal premotor cortex as well as in the superior parietal lobe and the intraparietal sulcus, in accord with our hypothesis. Activations for observed reaching were more dorsal than activations typically reported in the literature for observation of hand-object interactions (grasping). Our results suggest that the mirror neuron system is specific to the type of hand action performed, and that these fronto-parietal activations are a putative human homologue of the neural circuits underlying reaching in macaques. The parietal activations reported here for executed, imagined, and observed reaching are also consistent with previous functional imaging studies on planned reaching and delayed pointing movements, and extend the proposed localization of human reach-related brain areas to observation as well as imagery of reaching.

Meta-analyses of fMRI studies of executive functions (EFs) show that ADHD patients have cognitive-domain dissociated complex multisystem impairments in several right and left hemispheric dorsal, ventral and medial fronto-cingulo-striato-thalamic and fronto-parieto-cerebellar networks that mediate cognitive control, attention, timing and working memory (WM). There is furthermore emerging evidence for abnormalities in orbital and ventromedial prefrontal and limbic areas that mediate motivation and emotion control. In addition, poor deactivation of the default mode network (DMN) suggests an abnormal interrelationship between hypo-engaged task-positive and poorly ""switched off"" hyper-engaged task-negative networks, both of which are related to impaired cognition. Translational cognitive neuroscience in ADHD is still in its infancy. Pattern recognition analyses have attempted to provide diagnostic classification of ADHD using fMRI data with respectable classification accuracies of over 80%. Necessary replication studies, however, are still outstanding. Brain stimulation has been tested in heterogeneously designed, small numbered proof of concept studies targeting key frontal functional impairments in ADHD. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) appears to be promising to improve ADHD symptoms and cognitive functions based on some studies, but larger clinical trials of repeated stimulation with and without cognitive training are needed to test clinical efficacy and potential costs on non-targeted functions. Only three studies have piloted NF of fMRI-based frontal dysfunctions in ADHD using fMRI or near-infrared spectroscopy, with the two larger ones finding some improvements in cognition and symptoms, which, however, were not superior to the active control conditions, suggesting potential placebo effects. Neurotherapeutics seems attractive for ADHD due to their safety and potential longer-term neuroplastic effects, which drugs cannot offer. However, they need to be thoroughly tested for short- and longer-term clinical and cognitive efficacy and their potential for individualized treatment. ",

Functional neuroimaging was used to assess brain response to food images among groups of overweight (OW), normal-weight (NW), and successful weight-losing (SWL) adolescents. Eleven SWL, 12 NW, and 11 OW participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while viewing images of high- and low-energy foods. When viewing high-energy food images, SWLs demonstrated greater activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) compared with OW and NW controls. Compared with NW and SWL groups, OW individuals demonstrated greater activation in the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate in response to food images. Adolescent SWLs demonstrated greater neural activation in the DLPFC compared with OW/NW controls when viewing high-energy food stimuli, which may indicate enhanced executive control. OW individuals' brain responses to food stimuli may indicate greater reward incentive processes than either SWL or NW groups. ",

The Go/NoGo task is a common task used to tap basic inhibitory processes important in higher order executive functioning. The present study assessed neural correlates of response inhibition during performance of a Go/NoGo task in which NoGo signals or tests of inhibitory control consisted of images of beer bottles. Group comparisons were conducted between 21 heavy and 20 light drinkers, ranging in age from 18 to 22. Behaviorally, overall performance assessed with d-prime was significantly better among the lighter drinkers. On a neural level, the heavy drinkers showed significantly greater activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, medial frontal cortex and cingulate relative to the light drinkers during the NoGo trials. These regions are implicated in reflective or control processing of information. Further, heavy drinkers showed significantly greater activity in the insula relative to light drinkers during NoGo trials, a neural region implicated in habit circuitry and tied to cue induced urges and emotional memories of physical effects of drugs. These results suggest that the heavier drinkers may have experienced increased working memory demand and control efforts to withhold a response due to poorer inhibitory control from enhanced salience of alcohol cues on the beer NoGo trials, which also engaged insula mediated effects.

Moreover, a series of neuropsychological tests were used to assess the subject's cognitive performance. We found cognitive impairment following cerebellar infarction involving multiple cognitive domains, including memory, executive functions, visuospatial abilities, processing speed and language functions, and brain topological abnormalities, including changes in clustering coefficients, shortest path lengths, global efficiency, local efficiencies, betweenness centrality and nodal efficiencies. Our results indicated that measures of local efficiency, mainly in the precuneus, cingulate gyrus and frontal-temporal cortex, were significantly reduced with posterior cerebellar infarction. At the same time, The correlation analysis suggested thatthe abnormal alterations in the right PCG, bilateral DCG, right PCUN may play a core role in the cognitive impairment following cerebellar infarctions. The differences in topological features of the structural brain networks within the cerebro-cerebellar circuits may provide a new approach to explore the pathophysiological mechanisms of cognitive impairment following cerebellar infarction.

pmid_20677377,Persistent posterior and transient anterior medial temporal lobe activity during navigation.,,"A functional segregation along the posterior-anterior axis of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) has been suggested. In brief, it is thought that the posterior hippocampus represents environmental detail and/or encodes space, whereas the anterior part represents the environment more as a whole and/or subserves behavior. Different phases of navigation should thus recruit different structures within the MTL. Based on animal studies and neuroimaging data from humans, the initial phase of navigation, i.e., self-localization, target localization and path planning, should depend on the anterior MTL independent of upcoming navigational demands, whereas posterior MTL should be active throughout navigation. We tested this prediction using fMRI with navigation in a learned large-scale virtual office landscape with numerous complex landmarks under different navigational conditions. The initial navigational phase specifically engaged the anterior MTL. Increased activity was found bilaterally in the rostral and caudal entorhinal cortex. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of entorhinal activity in virtual navigation detected in a direct comparison. Also bilateral anterior hippocampus and anterior parahippocampal cortex were significantly more active during the initial phase. Activity lasting throughout the navigational period was found in the right posterior hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex. Hippocampal activity for the entire navigation period was only detected when the virtual environment remained unaltered. Navigational success was positively correlated with activity in the anterior right hippocampus for the initial phase, and more posteriorly in the hippocampus for the whole navigation period. Plots of the BOLD signal time course demonstrated that activity in the anterior hippocampus was transient whereas activity in the posterior hippocampus peaked regularly throughout the entire navigation period. These results support a functional segregation within the MTL with regard to navigational phases. The anterior MTL appears to complete associations related to the environment at large and provide a behavioral plan for navigation, whereas the posterior part keeps track of current location. ",
pmid_16721614,"Dysfunction of ventral striatal reward prediction in schizophrenic patients treated with typical, not atypical, neuroleptics.",,"Clinical studies in patients with schizophrenia suggest that atypical neuroleptics are more effective than typical neuroleptics in reducing negative symptoms including apathy and anhedonia. Dysfunction of the dopaminergic reward system may contribute to negative symptoms in schizophrenia. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the blood oxygen level dependency response in the ventral striatum of medicated schizophrenics and healthy control subjects during reward anticipation. Twenty schizophrenics [ten medicated with typical (e.g., haloperidol) and ten with atypical (e.g., olanzapine and risperidone) neuroleptics] and ten age-matched healthy volunteers participated in an incentive monetary delay task in which visual cues predicted that a rapid response to a subsequent target stimulus would result either in monetary gain or no consequence. Healthy volunteers and schizophrenics treated with atypical neuroleptics showed ventral striatal activation in response to reward-indicating cues, but schizophrenics treated with typical neuroleptics did not. In patients treated with typical neuroleptics, decrease in activation of the left ventral striatum was correlated with the severity of negative symptoms. Failure to activate the ventral striatum during reward anticipation was previously associated with the severity of negative symptoms in schizophrenia and was also found in schizophrenics treated with typical neuroleptics in this study. Significant blunting of ventral striatal activation was not observed in patients treated with atypical neuroleptics, which may reflect the improved efficacy of these drugs in treating negative symptoms.

Regional homogeneity","The precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex, which has been associated with pain sensitivity, plays a pivotal role in the default mode network. However, information regarding migraine-related alterations in resting-state brain functional connectivity in the default mode network and in local regional spontaneous neuronal activity is not adequate. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to acquire resting-state scans in 22 migraineurs without aura and in 22 healthy matched controls. Independent component analysis, a data-driven method, was used to calculate the resting-state functional connectivity of the default mode network in the patient and healthy control groups. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) was used to analyse the local features of spontaneous resting-state brain activity in the migraineurs without aura. Compared with the healthy controls, migraineurs without aura showed increased functional connectivity in the left precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex within the default mode network and significant increase in ReHo values in the bilateral precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex, left pons and trigeminal nerve entry zone. In addition, functional connectivity was decreased between the areas with abnormal ReHo (using the peaks in the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex) and other brain areas. The abnormalities in the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex suggest that migraineurs without aura may exhibit information transfer and multimodal integration dysfunction and that pain sensitivity and pian processing may also be affected.

pmid_21383264,Gene x disease interaction on orbitofrontal gray matter in cocaine addiction.,,"Long-term cocaine use has been associated with structural deficits in brain regions having dopamine-receptive neurons. However, the concomitant use of other drugs and common genetic variability in monoamine regulation present additional structural variability. To examine variations in gray matter volume (GMV) as a function of lifetime drug use and the genotype of the monoamine oxidase A gene, MAOA, in men with cocaine use disorders (CUD) and healthy male controls. Cross-sectional comparison. Clinical Research Center at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Forty individuals with CUD and 42 controls who underwent magnetic resonance imaging to assess GMV and were genotyped for the MAOA polymorphism (categorized as high- and low-repeat alleles). The impact of cocaine addiction on GMV, tested by (1) comparing the CUD group with controls, (2) testing diagnosis × MAOA interactions, and (3) correlating GMV with lifetime cocaine, alcohol, and cigarette smoking, and testing their unique contribution to GMV beyond other factors. (1) Individuals with CUD had reductions in GMV in the orbitofrontal, dorsolateral prefrontal, and temporal cortex and the hippocampus compared with controls. (2) The orbitofrontal cortex reductions were uniquely driven by CUD with low- MAOA genotype and by lifetime cocaine use. (3) The GMV in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampus was driven by lifetime alcohol use beyond the genotype and other pertinent variables. Long-term cocaine users with the low-repeat MAOA allele have enhanced sensitivity to gray matter loss, specifically in the orbitofrontal cortex, indicating that this genotype may exacerbate the deleterious effects of cocaine in the brain. In addition, long-term alcohol use is a major contributor to gray matter loss in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, and is likely to further impair executive function and learning in cocaine addiction.

pmid_23228724,Altered cerebellar-cerebral resting-state functional connectivity reliably identifies major depressive disorder.,,"In recent years, the cerebellum has been demonstrated to be involved in cognitive control and emotional processing and to play an important role in the pathology of major depressive disorder (MDD). The current study aims to explore the potential utility of selecting the altered cerebellar-cerebral functional connectivity as a classification feature to discriminate depressed patients from healthy controls. Twenty-four medication-free patients with major depression and 29 matched, healthy controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. A promising classification accuracy of 90.6% was achieved using resting-state functional connectivity between predefined cerebellar seed regions and the voxels within the cerebrum as features. Moreover, the most discriminating functional connections were mainly located between the cerebellum and the anterior cingulate cortex, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the temporal lobe and the fusiform gyrus, which may contribute to the emotional and cognitive impairments observed in major depression. The current findings imply that the cerebellum might be considered as a node in the distributed disease-related brain network in major depression. ",
pmid_25944410,Relating Intrinsic Low-Frequency BOLD Cortical Oscillations to Cognition in Schizophrenia.,,"The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal during resting-state fMRI reflects the magnitude of local low-frequency BOLD oscillations, rather than interregional connectivity. ALFF is of interest to studies of cognition because fluctuations in spontaneous intrinsic brain activity relate to, and possibly even constrain, task-evoked brain responses in healthy people. Lower ALFF has been reported in schizophrenia, but the cognitive correlates of these reductions remain unknown. Here, we assess relationships between ALFF and attention and working memory in order to establish the functional relevance of intrinsic BOLD oscillatory power alterations with respect to specific cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. As part of the multisite FBIRN study, resting-state fMRI data were collected from schizophrenia subjects (SZ; n=168) and healthy controls (HC; n=166). Voxelwise fractional ALFF (fALFF), a normalized ALFF measure, was regressed on neuropsychological measures of sustained attention and working memory in SZ and HC to identify regions showing either common slopes across groups or slope differences between groups (all findings p<0.01 height, p<0.05 family-wise error cluster corrected). Poorer sustained attention was associated with smaller fALFF in the left superior frontal cortex and bilateral temporoparietal junction in both groups, with additional relationships in bilateral posterior parietal, posterior cingulate, dorsal anterior cingulate (ACC), and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) evident only in SZ. Poorer working memory was associated with smaller fALFF in bilateral ACC/mPFC, DLPFC, and posterior parietal cortex in both groups. Our findings indicate that smaller amplitudes of low-frequency BOLD oscillations during rest, measured by fALFF, were significantly associated with poorer cognitive performance, sometimes similarly in both groups and sometimes only in SZ, in regions known to subserve sustained attention and working memory. Taken together, these data suggest that the magnitude of resting-state BOLD oscillations shows promise as a biomarker of cognitive function in health and disease. ",
pmid_21106812,Acute and sustained effects of cognitive emotion regulation in major depression.,,"Dysfunctional regulation of mood and emotion is a key component of major depressive disorder and leads to sustained negative feelings. Using functional MRI (fMRI), we investigated the temporal dynamics of emotion regulation in patients with major depressive disorder and in healthy controls, testing for acute and sustained neural effects of active emotion regulation. Moderately depressed individuals (n = 17) and never-depressed healthy control subjects (n = 17) underwent fMRI during performance of an active cognitive emotion regulation task while viewing emotionally arousing pictures. In a second task, completed 15 min later, subjects were presented with the same stimuli in a passive viewing task. Whole-brain analyses and connectivity measures were used to determine acute and sustained effects of emotion regulation on brain activation and coupling between regions. On the group level, patients were able to downregulate negative emotions and corresponding amygdala activation, but this ability decreased with increasing symptom severity. Moreover, only healthy control subjects showed a sustained regulation effect in the amygdala after a 15 min delay, whereas depressed patients did not. Finally, patients exhibited diminished prefrontal activation and reduced prefrontolimbic coupling during active regulation. Although emotion regulation capacity in medicated depressive patients appears to be preserved depending on symptom severity, the effect is not sustained. Correlational analyses provide evidence that this diminished sustained-regulation effect might be related to reduced prefrontal activation during regulation. ",
pmid_16079245,Increased neural efficiency with repeated performance of a working memory task is information-type dependent.,,"Unlike tasks in which practice leads to an automatic stimulus-response association, it is thought working memory (WM) tasks continue to require cognitive control processes after repeated performance. Previous studies investigating WM task repetition are in accord with this. However, it is unclear whether changes in neural activity after repetition imply alterations in general control processes common to all WM tasks or are specific to the selection, encoding and maintenance of the relevant information. In the present study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine changes during sample, delay and test periods during repetition of both object and spatial delayed recognition tasks. We found decreases in fMRI activation in both spatial and object-selective areas after spatial WM task repetition, independent of behavioral performance. Few areas showed changed activity after object WM task repetition. These results indicate that spatial task repetition leads to increased efficiency of maintaining task-relevant information and improved ability to filter out task-irrelevant information. The specificity of this repetition effect to the spatial task suggests a difference exists in the nature of the representation of object and spatial information and that their maintenance in WM is likely subserved by different neural systems.

Tau protein","Alzheimer's disease (AD) and diabetes mellitus, especially type 2 (T2DM), are very common and widespread diseases in contemporary societies, and their incidence is steadily on the increase. T2DM is a multiple metabolic disorder, with several mechanisms including hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance, insulin receptor and insulin growth factor disturbances, glucose toxicity, formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and the activity of their receptors. AD is the most common form of dementia, characterized by the accumulation of extracellular beta amyloid peptide aggregates and intracellular hyper-phosphorylated tau proteins, which are thought to drive and/or accelerate inflammatory and oxidative stress processes leading to neurodegeneration. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the evidence linking T2DM to the onset and development of AD and highlight the unknown or poorly studied ""nooks and crannies"" of this interesting relationship, hence providing an opportunity to stimulate new ideas for the analysis of comorbidities between AD and DM. Despite, indication of possible biomarkers of early diagnosis of T2DM and AD, this review is also an attempt to answer the question as to whether the crucial factors in the development of both conditions support the link between DM and AD.

However, the underlying neurophysiological mechanism remains unknown. Here, the effects of CCT on OCD and the resting-state brain function were investigated. Fifty-nine OCD patients underwent CCT, pharmacotherapy plus CCT (pCCT), or pharmacotherapy. Before and after a 4-week treatment, Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive scale (Y-BOCS) was evaluated and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was scanned. Compared with the baseline, significant reduction of Y-BOCS scores was found after four-week treatment (p < .001) in groups of CCT and pCCT, not in pharmacotherapy. Post-treatment Y-BOCS scores of CCT group and pCCT group were not different, but significantly lower than that of pharmacotherapy group (p < .001). Compared with pretreatment, two clusters of brain regions with significant change in amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) were obtained in those who treated with CCT and pCCT, but not in those who received pharmacotherapy. The ALFF in cluster 1 (insula, putamen, and postcentral gyrus in left cerebrum) was decreased, while the ALFF in cluster 2 (occipital medial gyrus, occipital inferior gyrus, and lingual gyrus in right hemisphere) was increased after treatment (corrected p < .05). The changes of ALFF were correlated with the reduction of Y-BOCS score and were greater in remission than in nonremission. The reduction of the fear of negative events was correlated to the changes of ALFF of clusters and the reduction of Y-BOCS score. The effectiveness of CCT for OCD was related to the alteration of resting-state brain function-the brain plasticity. ChiCTR-IPC-15005969. ",

In this study, we examined the connectivity of the medial prefrontal cortices and anterior insulae in 24 healthy controls, 24 patients with schizophrenia, and 24 patients with MDD early in illness with seed-based resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis using Statistical Probability Mapping. As hypothesized, reduced connectivity was found between the medial prefrontal cortex and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and other nodes associated with directed effort in patients with schizophrenia compared to controls while patients with MDD had reduced connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex and ventral prefrontal emotional encoding regions compared to controls. Reduced connectivity was found between the anterior insulae and the medial prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia compared to controls, but contrary to some models emotion processing regions failed to demonstrate increased connectivity with the medial prefrontal cortex in MDD compared to controls. Although, not statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons, patients with schizophrenia tended to demonstrate decreased connectivity between basal ganglia-thalamocortical regions and the medial prefrontal cortex compared to patients with MDD, which might be expected as these regions effect action. Results were interpreted to support anomalies in nodes associated with directed effort in schizophrenia and nodes associated with emotional encoding network in MDD compared to healthy controls. ",

fMRI","Expectations shape the way we experience the world. In this study, we used fMRI to investigate how positive and negative expectation can change pain experiences in the same cohort of subjects. We first manipulated subjects' treatment expectation of the effectiveness of three inert creams, with one cream labeled ""Lidocaine"" (positive expectancy), one labeled ""Capsaicin"" (negative expectancy) and one labeled ""Neutral"" by surreptitiously decreasing, increasing, or not changing respectively, the intensity of the noxious stimuli administered following cream application. We then used fMRI to investigate the signal changes associated with administration of identical pain stimuli before and after the treatment and control creams. Twenty-four healthy adults completed the study. Results showed that expectancy significantly modulated subjective pain ratings. After controlling for changes in the neutral condition, the subjective pain rating changes evoked by positive and negative expectancies were significantly associated. fMRI results showed that the expectation of an increase in pain induced significant fMRI signal changes in the insula, orbitofrontal cortex, and periaqueductal gray, whereas the expectation of pain relief evoked significant fMRI signal changes in the striatum. No brain regions were identified as common to both ""Capsaicin"" and ""Lidocaine"" conditioning. There was also no significant association between the brain response to identical noxious stimuli in the pain matrix evoked by positive and negative expectancies. Our findings suggest that positive and negative expectancies engage different brain networks to modulate our pain experiences, but, overall, these distinct patterns of neural activation result in a correlated placebo and nocebo behavioral response.

Young, middle-aged and old adults carried out a natural/artificial judgment of images of common objects that were randomly presented in one of the quadrants of the screen. At retrieval, the images were displayed at the center of the screen and the participants judged whether each image was new or old and, if old, they indicated in which quadrant of the screen the image had originally been presented. Comparing the items associated with correct versus incorrect source judgments revealed that no regions showed greater activity in young adults than in middle-aged adults; however, in young and middle-aged adults the activity in the left hippocampus and left anterior temporal cortex was of greater magnitude than in the older adults. Several regions also exhibited greater activity in young adults than in old adults. These results suggest that in middle age the recollection neural network, assessable by fMRI, is still preserved.

pmid_19651401,Neural correlates of the use of psychological distancing to regulate responses to negative social cues: a study of patients with borderline personality disorder.,,"Emotional instability is a defining feature of borderline personality disorder (BPD); yet, little is understood about its underlying neural correlates. One possible contributing factor to emotional instability is a failure to adequately employ adaptive cognitive regulatory strategies such as psychological distancing. To determine whether there are differences in neural dynamics underlying this control strategy between BPD patients and healthy control (HC) subjects, blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging signals were acquired as 18 BPD and 16 HC subjects distanced from or simply looked at pictures depicting social interactions. Contrasts in signal between distance and look conditions were compared between groups. Borderline personality disorder patients showed a different pattern of activation compared with HC subjects when looking at negative versus neutral pictures. When distancing versus looking at negative pictures, both groups showed decreased negative affect ratings and increased activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, areas near/along the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and posterior cingulate/precuneus regions. However, the BPD group showed less BOLD signal change in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and IPS, less deactivation in the amygdala, and greater activation in the superior temporal sulcus and superior frontal gyrus. Borderline personality disorder and HC subjects display different neural dynamics while passively viewing social emotional stimuli. In addition, BPD patients do not engage the cognitive control regions to the extent that HCs do when employing a distancing strategy to regulate emotional reactions, which may be a factor contributing to the affective instability of BPD.

To clarify the pathophysiology of this disorder, regional changes in brain function were examined during administration of cognitive and symptom provocation tasks in patients with OCD before and after treatment. Ten outpatients with OCD participated in the study. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed before and after treatment. Stroop and symptom provocation tasks were administered during fMRI. Each patient was randomly allocated to receive either pharmacotherapy with fluvoxamine 200 mg/day (n = 4) or behavior therapy (n = 6) for 12 weeks. After 12-week treatment, mean (+/- SD) total score on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale decreased from 29.00 +/- 3.59 to 14.60 +/- 9.22, representing symptomatic improvement from moderate to mild. After symptom improvement, symptom provocation-related activation in the orbitofrontal, dorsolateral-prefrontal, and anterior cingulate cortices decreased. Conversely, Stroop task-related activation in the parietal cortex and cerebellum increased. After improvement of OCD with either fluvoxamine or behavioral therapy, hyperactivation of the frontal lobe related to a symptom-provocative state decreases, and posterior brain activity related to action-monitoring function increases.

pmid_12516313,ADHD and conduct disorder: an MRI study in a community sample.,,"MRI studies of children with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have consistently attributed core deficits of inattention and impulsivity to frontal-striatal-cerebellar abnormalities; however, no study has investigated the neuroanatomical characteristics of children with ADHD and Conduct Disorder (CD). This study examined a community sample of 12 children with combined subtype ADHD (aged 8-12, 7 with CD) and 19 healthy controls matched for age, gender, handedness and poverty. Volume measurements, including left/right asymmetries, were quantified from MRI of the total brain, caudate and cerebellar vermis. No significant differences in total brain volume, caudate volume, asymmetry of the hemispheres or asymmetry of the caudate were found between the groups. Measurements of the left and total posterior superior and inferior lobes of the vermis, however, indicated smaller volumes for both pure ADHD and co-morbid children compared to the controls. Analysis of variance demonstrated no significant volumetric differences between the pure ADHD and co-morbid types. Prolonged exposure to methylphenidate was associated with caudate volumes. These results suggest ADHD and ADHD co-morbid with CD have similar deviant cerebellar morphology and replicate previous studies with an epidemiologically derived sample. ",

We used pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling (ASL) perfusion functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the effects of IGA on resting brain functions by comparing resting cerebral blood flow in adolescents with IGA and normal subjects. Fifteen adolescents with IGA and 18 matched normal adolescents underwent structural and perfusion fMRI in the resting state. Direct subtraction, voxel-wise general linear modeling was performed to compare resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) between the 2 groups. Correlations were calculated between the mean CBF value in all clusters that survived AlphaSim correction and the Chen Internet Addiction Scale (CIAS) scores, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11) scores, or hours of Internet use per week (hours) in the 15 subjects with IGA. Compared with control subjects, adolescents with IGA showed significantly higher global CBF in the left inferior temporal lobe/fusiform gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus/amygdala, right medial frontal lobe/anterior cingulate cortex, left insula, right insula, right middle temporal gyrus, right precentral gyrus, left supplementary motor area, left cingulate gyrus, and right inferior parietal lobe. Lower CBF was found in the left middle temporal gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus, and right cingulate gyrus. There were no significant correlations between mean CBF values in all clusters that survived AlphaSim correction and CIAS or BIS-11 scores or hours of Internet use per week. In this study, we used ASL perfusion fMRI and noninvasively quantified resting CBF to demonstrate that IGA alters the CBF distribution in the adolescent brain. The results support the hypothesis that IGA is a behavioral addiction that may share similar neurobiological abnormalities with other addictive disorders. ",

Relationships between ReHo measures and cognitive impairments in patients with drug-naive First-Episode Schizophrenia (dn-FES) are rarely reported. This study was conducted to explore the correlations between ReHo measures and cognitive deficits and clinical symptoms in patients with dn-FES. A total of 69 patients with dn-FES and 74 healthy controls were recruited. MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), and Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) were used to assess cognitive function, Intelligence Quotient (IQ), and clinical symptoms, respectively. The correlations between ReHo maps and cognitive deficits and the severity of symptoms were examined using strict correlation analysis. ReHo values in right Middle Frontal Gyrus (MFG) and Superior Frontal Gyrus (SFG) increased in dn-FES group, whereas ReHo values in right cuneus decreased. Correlation analysis showed that the ReHo values in right MFG positively correlated with attention/vigilance impairments, social cognition deficits, and the severity of clinical manifestations. These findings suggested that abnormal spontaneous activities in right MFG reflect illness severity and cognitive deficits, which also serve as a basis for establishing objective diagnostic markers and might be a clinical intervention target for treating patients with schizophrenia.

pmid_22091533,Functional neural correlates of psychometric schizotypy: an fMRI study of antisaccades.,,"Dimensional models of psychosis assume a continuum between schizotypy and schizophrenia. However, little is known about the overlap in brain functional alterations between schizotypy and schizophrenia. Fifty-four healthy volunteers underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during an antisaccade task, a measure of cognitive control known to be impaired in schizophrenia, and a prosaccade task. Higher positive schizotypy was correlated with higher antisaccade error rates. Associations between reduced blood oxygenation level dependent signal and higher schizotypy were found during antisaccades in the putamen, thalamus, cerebellum, and visual cortex and during prosaccades in the visual cortex, supplementary eye field, and posterior intraparietal sulcus. These findings show that increased schizotypy is associated with decreased antisaccade performance and reduced brain function in regions also affected in schizophrenia, therefore providing evidence of neurocognitive and neurophysiological overlap between schizotypy and schizophrenia.

We investigated both intra- and inter-regional synchronized activity in twenty patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder and 20 healthy controls using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity methods were used to analyze the intra- and inter-regional synchronized activity, respectively. Compared with healthy controls, patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder showed significantly increased ReHo in the orbitofrontal cortex, cerebellum, and insula, and decreased ReHo in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, caudate, and inferior occipital cortex. Based on ReHo results, we determined functional connectivity differences between the orbitofrontal cortex and other brain regions in both patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder and controls. We found abnormal functional connectivity between the orbitofrontal cortex and ventral anterior cingulate cortex in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder compared with healthy controls. Moreover, ReHo in the orbitofrontal cortex was correlated with the duration of obsessive-compulsive disorder. These findings suggest that increased intra- and inter-regional synchronized activity in the orbitofrontal cortex may have a key role in the pathology of obsessive-compulsive disorder. In addition to orbitofronto-striato-thalamic circuitry, brain regions such as the insula and cerebellum may also be involved in the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder. ",

Asia is a major area of the rapidly emerging T2DM global epidemic, with China and India the top two epicentres. Although genetic predisposition partly determines individual susceptibility to T2DM, an unhealthy diet and a sedentary lifestyle are important drivers of the current global epidemic; early developmental factors (such as intrauterine exposures) also have a role in susceptibility to T2DM later in life. Many cases of T2DM could be prevented with lifestyle changes, including maintaining a healthy body weight, consuming a healthy diet, staying physically active, not smoking and drinking alcohol in moderation. Most patients with T2DM have at least one complication, and cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. This Review provides an updated view of the global epidemiology of T2DM, as well as dietary, lifestyle and other risk factors for T2DM and its complications. ",
pmid_20080877,Combining a semantic differential with fMRI to investigate brands as cultural symbols.,,"Traditionally, complex cultural symbols like brands are investigated with psychological approaches. Often this is done by using semantic differentials, in which participants are asked to rate a brand regarding different pairs of adjectives. Only recently, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to examine brands. In the current work we used fMRI in combination with a semantic differential to cross-validate both methods and to improve the characterization of the basic factors constituting the semantic space. To this end we presented pictures of brands while recording subject's brain activity during an fMRI experiment. Results of the semantic differential arranged the brands in a semantic space illustrating their relationships to other cultural symbols. FMRI results revealed activation of the medial prefrontal cortex for brands that loaded high on the factor 'social competence', suggesting an involvement of a cortical network associated with social cognitions. In contrast, brands closely related to the factor 'potency' showed decreased activity in the superior frontal gyri, possibly related to working memory during task performance. We discuss the results as a different engagement of the prefrontal cortex when perceiving brands as cultural symbols. ",
pmid_18996489,Anxiety predicts a differential neural response to attended and unattended facial signals of anger and fear.,,"Behavioural evidence indicates that individual differences in anxiety influence the response to facial signals of threat. Angry and fearful faces represent qualitatively different forms of threat. Fearful faces are thought to signal the presence of a significant, yet undetermined source of danger within the environment, referred to as 'ambiguous threat'. In contrast, angry faces represent a more direct form of threat, often used in face-to-face encounters to exert dominance. Given the inherent differences between anger and fear, we hypothesised that anxiety would modulate the amygdala response to angry faces to a greater extent when attended. Following previous research, we expected anxiety to show a stronger relationship with the amygdala response to unattended fearful faces. In an event-related fMRI study, we presented images of two houses and two faces (consisting of fearful, angry or neutral expressions) in horizontal and vertical pairs around a central fixation cross, with participants instructed to attend to either the face or house stimuli. The results showed that higher anxiety levels produced an increased right amygdala response to viewer directed angry facial expressions (versus neutral or fearful faces) only when attended. By contrast, increased anxiety was associated with a greater left amygdala response to fearful faces (versus neutral or angry faces) in the unattended condition, with only borderline evidence for attended fear (relative to neutral). Our findings demonstrate the striking effects of personality in a non-clinical population, and show how this can distinguish the neural coding of anger and fear faces. ",
pmid_15769206,The role of the prefrontal cortex in the maintenance of verbal working memory: an event-related FMRI analysis.,,"Neuroimaging studies have been inconclusive in characterizing the role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) for maintaining increasingly larger amounts of information in working memory (WM). To address this question, the authors collected event-related functional MRI data while participants performed an item-recognition task in which the number of to-be-remembered letters was parametrically modulated. During maintenance of information in WM, the dorsolateral and the ventrolateral PFC exhibited linearly increasing activation in response to increasing WM load. Prefrontal regions could not be distinguished from one another on the basis of load sensitivity, but the dorsolateral PFC had stronger functional connectivity with the parietal and motor cortex than the ventrolateral PFC. These results suggest an increasingly important role for the PFC in actively maintaining information as the amount of that information increases. ",
pmid_17280644,Self-paced working memory: validation of verbal variations of the n-back paradigm.,,"Self-paced versions of many paradigms could have utility in probing cognitive systems. To validate several self-paced n-back paradigms, fourteen subjects performed four variations of the working memory task using visually presented letters as stimuli. Several areas in the frontal lobe, the anterior cingulate and a parietal network were consistently activated in the four variations: identity of black letters, location of black letters, color of colored letters and identity of colored letters. Since the n-back task is one of the more popular methods of investigating working memory, we validated the utility of several self-paced versions in normal subjects via quantitative, coordinate-based meta-analyses. The self-paced results agree well with meta-analyses and other published results, giving confidence that a self-paced n-back paradigm is robust in multiple variations. Behavioral results differ from other published reports, perhaps offering insight into true working memory strategy in normal subjects. ",
pmid_17133391,Regulation of emotional responses elicited by threat-related stimuli.,,"The capacity to voluntarily regulate emotions is critical for mental health, especially when coping with aversive events. Several neuroimaging studies of emotion regulation found the amygdala to be a target for downregulation and prefrontal regions to be associated with downregulation. To characterize the role of prefrontal regions in bidirectional emotion regulation and to investigate regulatory influences on amygdala activity and peripheral physiological measures, a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study with simultaneous recording of self-report, startle eyeblink, and skin conductance responses was carried out. Subjects viewed threat-related pictures and were asked to up- and downregulate their emotional responses using reappraisal strategies. While startle eyeblink responses (in successful regulators) and skin conductance responses were amplified during upregulation, but showed no consistent effect during downregulation, amygdala activity was increased and decreased according to the regulation instructions. Trial-by-trial ratings of regulation success correlated positively with activity in amygdala during upregulation and orbitofrontal cortex during downregulation. Downregulation was characterized by left-hemispheric activation peaks in anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex and upregulation was characterized by a pattern of prefrontal activation not restricted to the left hemisphere. Further analyses showed significant overlap of prefrontal activation across both regulation conditions, possibly reflecting cognitive processes underlying both up- and downregulation, but also showed distinct activations in each condition. The present study demonstrates that amygdala responses to threat-related stimuli can be controlled through the use of cognitive strategies depending on recruitment of prefrontal areas, thereby changing the subject's affective state.

Voxel-based morphometry","Disturbances in the processing and regulation of emotions are core symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD). To further elucidate neural underpinnings of BPD, the present meta-analysis summarizes functional neuroimaging findings of emotion processing tasks, as well as structural neuroimaging findings, and investigates multimodally affected brain regions. Combined coordinate- and image-based meta-analyses were calculated using anisotropic effect size signed differential mapping. Nineteen functional neuroimaging studies investigating the processing of negative compared with neutral stimuli in a total of 281 patients with BPD and 293 healthy control subjects (HC) were included. In addition, 10 studies investigating gray matter abnormalities in 263 patients with BPD and 278 HC were analyzed. Compared with HC, BPD patients showed relatively increased activation of the left amygdala and posterior cingulate cortex, along with blunted responses of the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, during the processing of negative emotional stimuli. The multimodal analysis identified the left amygdala to be characterized by a combination of functional hyperactivity and smaller gray matter volume compared with HC. Hyperresponsivity of the amygdala was moderated by medication status of the patient samples. Medication-free samples were characterized by limbic hyperactivity, whereas no such group differences were found in patients currently taking psychotropic medication. Results strengthen the assumption that dysfunctional dorsolateral prefrontal and limbic brain regions are a hallmark feature of BPD and therefore are consistent with the conceptualization of BPD as an emotion dysregulation disorder.

pmid_23840505,Length of Acupuncture Training and Structural Plastic Brain Changes in Professional Acupuncturists.,,"The research on brain plasticity has fascinated researchers for decades. Use/training serves as an instrumental factor to influence brain neuroplasticity. Parallel to acquisition of behavioral expertise, extensive use/training is concomitant with substantial changes of cortical structure. Acupuncturists, serving as a model par excellence to study tactile-motor and emotional regulation plasticity, receive intensive training in national medical schools following standardized training protocol. Moreover, their behavioral expertise is corroborated during long-term clinical practice. Although our previous study reported functional plastic brain changes in the acupuncturists, whether or not structural plastic changes occurred in acupuncturists is yet elusive. Cohorts of acupuncturists (N = 22) and non-acupuncturists (N = 22) were recruited. Behavioral tests were delivered to assess the acupuncturists' behavioral expertise. The results confirmed acupuncturists' tactile-motor skills and emotion regulation proficiency compared to non-acupuncturists. Using the voxel-based morphometry technique, we revealed larger grey matter volumes in acupuncturists in the hand representation of the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (SI), the right lobule V/VI and the bilateral ventral anterior cingulate cortex/ventral medial prefrontal cortex. Grey matter volumes of the SI and Lobule V/VI positively correlated with the duration of acupuncture practice. To our best knowledge, this study provides first evidence for the anatomical alterations in acupuncturists, which would possibly be the neural correlates underlying acupuncturists' exceptional skills. On one hand, we suggest our findings may have ramifications for tactile-motor rehabilitation. On the other hand, our results in emotion regulation domain may serve as a target for our future studies, from which we can understand how modulations of aversive emotions elicited by empathic pain develop in the context of expertise. Future longitudinal study is necessary to establish the presence and direction of a causal link between practice/use and brain anatomy. ",

object size","Grasping behaviors require the selection of grasp-relevant object dimensions, independent of overall object size. Previous neuroimaging studies found that the intraparietal cortex processes object size, but it is unknown whether the graspable dimension (i.e., grasp axis between selected points on the object) or the overall size of objects triggers activation in that region. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation to investigate human brain areas involved in processing the grasp-relevant dimension of real 3-dimensional objects in grasping and viewing tasks. Trials consisted of 2 sequential stimuli in which the object's grasp-relevant dimension, its global size, or both were novel or repeated. We found that calcarine and extrastriate visual areas adapted to object size regardless of the grasp-relevant dimension during viewing tasks. In contrast, the superior parietal occipital cortex (SPOC) and lateral occipital complex of the left hemisphere adapted to the grasp-relevant dimension regardless of object size and task. Finally, the dorsal premotor cortex adapted to the grasp-relevant dimension in grasping, but not in viewing, tasks, suggesting that motor processing was complete at this stage. Taken together, our results provide a complete cortical circuit for progressive transformation of general object properties into grasp-related responses. ",

pmid_9175134,The seats of reason? An imaging study of deductive and inductive reasoning.,,"We carried out a neuroimaging study to test the neurophysiological predictions made by different cognitive models of reasoning. Ten normal volunteers performed deductive and inductive reasoning tasks while their regional cerebral blood flow pattern was recorded using [15O]H2O PET imaging. In the control condition subjects semantically comprehended sets of three sentences. In the deductive reasoning condition subjects determined whether the third sentence was entailed by the first two sentences. In the inductive reasoning condition subjects reported whether the third sentence was plausible given the first two sentences. The deduction condition resulted in activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann areas 45, 47). The induction condition resulted in activation of a large area comprised of the left medial frontal gyrus, the left cingulate gyrus, and the left superior frontal gyrus (Brodmann areas 8, 9, 24, 32). Induction was distinguished from deduction by the involvement of the medial aspect of the left superior frontal gyrus (Brodmann areas 8, 9). These results are consistent with cognitive models of reasoning that postulate different mechanisms for inductive and deductive reasoning and view deduction as a formal rule-based process. ",

pmid_11160520,Multisensory cortical signal increases and decreases during vestibular galvanic stimulation (fMRI).,,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal increases (activations) and BOLD signal decreases (""deactivations"") were compared in six healthy volunteers during galvanic vestibular (mastoid) and galvanic cutaneous (neck) stimulation in order to differentiate vestibular from ocular motor and nociceptive functions. By calculating the contrast for vestibular activation minus cutaneous activation for the group, we found activations in the anterior parts of the insula, the paramedian and dorsolateral thalamus, the putamen, the inferior parietal lobule [Brodmann area (BA) 40], the precentral gyrus (frontal eye field, BA 6), the middle frontal gyrus (prefrontal cortex, BA 46/9), the middle temporal gyrus (BA 37), the superior temporal gyrus (BA 22), and the anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 32) as well as in both cerebellar hemispheres. These activations can be attributed to multisensory vestibular and ocular motor functions. Single-subject analysis in addition showed distinctly nonoverlapping activations in the posterior insula, which corresponds to the parieto-insular vestibular cortex in the monkey. During vestibular stimulation, there was also a significant signal decrease in the visual cortex (BA 18, 19), which spared BA 17. A different ""deactivation"" was found during cutaneous stimulation; it included upper parieto-occipital areas in the middle temporal and occipital gyri (BA 19/39/18). Under both stimulation conditions, there were signal decreases in the somatosensory cortex (BA 2/3/4). Stimulus-dependent, inhibitory vestibular-visual, and nociceptive-somatosensory interactions may be functionally significant for processing perception and sensorimotor control. ",
pmid_26333802,Type 2 diabetes mellitus and biomarkers of neurodegeneration.,,"Our objective was to investigate whether type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) influences neurodegeneration in a manner similar to Alzheimer disease (AD), by promoting brain β-amyloid (Aβ) or tau. We studied the cross-sectional associations of T2DM with cortical thickness, brain Aβ load, and CSF levels of Aβ and tau in a sample of people from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with diagnoses of AD dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and normal cognition. All (n=816) received MRI, and a subsample underwent brain amyloid imaging (n=102) and CSF Aβ and tau measurements (n=415). Analyses were performed across and within cognitive diagnostic strata. There were 124 people with T2DM (mean age 75.5 years) and 692 without T2DM (mean age 74.1 years). After adjusting for age, sex, total intracranial volume, APO ε4 status, and cognitive diagnosis, T2DM was associated with lower bilateral frontal and parietal cortical thickness (mL) (β=-0.03, p=0.01). T2DM was not associated with 11C Pittsburgh compound B standardized uptake value ratio (AU) in any brain region or with CSF Aβ42 levels (pg/mL). T2DM was associated with greater CSF total tau (pg/mL) (β=16.06, p=0.04) and phosphorylated tau (β=5.84, p=0.02). The association between T2DM and cortical thickness was attenuated by 15% by the inclusion of phosphorylated tau. T2DM may promote neurodegeneration independent of AD dementia diagnosis, and its effect may be driven by tau phosphorylation. The mechanisms through which T2DM may promote tau phosphorylation deserve further study. ",
pmid_26204264,Spontaneous Activity Associated with Delusions of Schizophrenia in the Left Medial Superior Frontal Gyrus: A Resting-State fMRI Study.,,"Delusions of schizophrenia have been found to be associated with alterations of some brain regions in structure and task-induced activation. However, the relationship between spontaneously occurring symptoms and spontaneous brain activity remains unclear. In the current study, 14 schizophrenic patients with delusions and 14 healthy controls underwent a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) scan. Patients with delusions of schizophrenia patients were rated with Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Characteristics of Delusional Rating Scale (CDRS). Regional homogeneity (ReHo) was calculated to measure the local synchronization of the spontaneous activity in a voxel-wise way. A two-sample t-test showed that ReHo of the right anterior cingulate gyrus and left medial superior frontal gyrus were higher in patients, and ReHo of the left superior occipital gyrus was lower, compared to healthy controls. Further, among patients, correlation analysis showed a significant difference between delusion scores of CRDS and ReHo of brain regions. ReHo of the left medial superior frontal gyrus was negatively correlated with patients' CDRS scores but not with delusional PANSS scores. These results suggested that altered local synchronization of spontaneous brain activity may be related to the pathophysiology of delusion in schizophrenia. ",
pmid_21907811,Functional topography of the cerebellum for motor and cognitive tasks: an fMRI study.,,"Anatomical, clinical and imaging findings suggest that the cerebellum is engaged in cognitive and affective functions as well as motor control. Evidence from converging modalities also indicates that there is a functional topography in the human cerebellum for overt control of movement vs. higher functions, such that the cerebellum can be divided into zones depending on connectivity with sensorimotor vs. multimodal association cortices. Using functional MRI, we show that regions active during overt movement differ from those involved in higher-level language, spatial processing and working memory tasks. Nine healthy participants each completed five tasks in order to determine the relative activation patterns for the different paradigms. Right-handed finger-tapping activated right cerebellar lobules IV-V and VIII, consistent with descriptions of the cerebellar homunculi. Verb generation engaged right cerebellar lobules VI-Crus I and a second cluster in lobules VIIB-VIIIA. Mental rotation activation peaks were localized to medial left cerebellar lobule VII (Crus II). A 2-back working memory task activated bilateral regions of lobules VI-VII. Viewing arousing vs. neutral images did not reliably activate the cerebellum or cerebral limbic areas in this study. The cerebellar functional topography identified in this study reflects the involvement of different cerebro-cerebellar circuits depending on the demands of the task being performed: overt movement activated sensorimotor cortices along with contralateral cerebellar lobules IV-V and VIII, whereas more cognitively demanding tasks engaged prefrontal and parietal cortices along with cerebellar lobules VI and VII. These findings provide further support for a cerebellar role in both motor and cognitive tasks, and better establish the existence of functional subregions in the cerebellum. Future studies are needed to determine the exact contribution of the cerebellum - and different cerebro-cerebellar circuits - to task performance. ",

impulsivity","Impulsivity and emotion dysregulation have been known to be risk factors for Internet gaming disorder (IGD), but their underlying neural mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Given that the prefrontal cortex has a key role in higher order cognition and addiction, the present study aimed to investigate emotional influences on response inhibition in situations with different cognitive demands. A total of 41 young male adults (20 with and 21 without IGD) were scanned while performing two versions of an emotional go/no-go task with demands on low and high working memory load. Patients with IGD showed a failure in response inhibition and increased activation of widespread brain regions, including prefrontal, motor-sensory, parietal, occipital, insula, and striatal regions across tasks. Among these regions, involvement of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum was observed only during the task with high demands on working memory. Moreover, it was also only during the high-load task that interaction between response inhibition and emotional states was observed in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, with observations revealing that its alteration in patients with IGD was associated with number of hours spent on Internet gaming. Our findings highlight a failure of response inhibition and dysfunction within the inhibitory control network. The special significance of our study is that dysfunctional dorsomedial prefrontal cortex may mediate abnormal emotional influences on response inhibition in patients with IGD. ",
pmid_22429244,Distinct cortical networks support the planning and online control of reaching-to-grasp in humans.,,"A number of brain imaging studies have identified regions involved in the planning and control of complex actions. Here we attempt to contrast activity related to planning and online control in the human brain during simple reaching and grasping movements. In four conditions, participants did one of the following: passively observed a grasp target; planned a grasping movement without executing; planned and then executed a grasp; or immediately executed a grasp. Neural activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging and activity in the various conditions compared. Two large, independent networks of brain activity were identified: (i) a planning network including the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, anterior cingulate, posterior medial parietal area, superior parietal occipital cortex and middle intraparietal sulcus; and (ii) a control network including sensorimotor cortex, the cerebellum, the supramarginal gyrus and the superior parietal lobule. These findings provide evidence that the planning and control of even simple reaching and grasping actions use different brain regions, including different parts of the frontal and parietal lobes.

Thirty-eight patients with MCI stratified into high and low quality of sleep in accordance with a self-reported questionnaire for sleep habits, and 38 controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Independent component analysis was used to reconstruct the default mode network and frontoparietal network (FPN). High quality of sleep was associated with increased FPN connectivity among patients with MCI. Moreover, a positive coupling of connectivity between networks was found in MCI reporting high quality of sleep, congruently with the pattern observed in controls, whereas this coupling was disrupted in MCI with low quality of sleep. An association between FPN connectivity and language scores was observed in MCI. These findings suggest a relationship between sleep quality and FPN connectivity in MCI that may underlie compensatory mechanisms to overcome advancing neurodegeneration. ",
pmid_21556876,Altered patterns of cortical activation in ALS patients during attention and cognitive response inhibition tasks.,,"Since amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) can be accompanied by executive dysfunction, it is hypothesised that ALS patients will have impaired performance on tests of cognitive inhibition. We predicted that ALS patients would show patterns of abnormal activation in extramotor regions when performing tests requiring the inhibition of prepotent responses (the Stroop effect) and the inhibition of prior negatively primed responses (the negative priming effect) when compared to healthy controls. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure activation during a sparse sequence block design paradigm investigating the Stroop and negative priming effects in 14 ALS patients and 8 healthy age- and IQ-matched controls. Behavioural measures of performance were collected. Both groups' reaction times (RTs) reflected the Stroop effect during scanning. The ALS and control groups did not differ significantly for any of the behavioural measures but did show significant differences in cerebral activation during both tasks. The ALS group showed increased activation predominantly in the left middle temporal gyrus (BA 20/21), left superior temporal gyrus (BA 22) and left anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 32). Neither group's RT data showed clear evidence of a negative priming effect. However the ALS group showed decreased activation, relative to controls, particularly in the left cingulate gyrus (BA 23/24), left precentral gyrus (BA 4/6) and left medial frontal gyrus (BA 6). Greater cerebral activation in the ALS group accompanying the performance of the Stroop effect and areas of decreased activation during the negative priming comparison suggest altered inhibitory processing in ALS, consistent with other evidence of executive dysfunction in ALS. The current findings require further exploration in a larger study. ",

Previous imaging studies investigating working memory in ADHD have used tasks involving different cognitive resources and ignoring the categorical judgments about objects that are essential parts of performance in visual working memory tasks, thus complicating the interpretation of their findings. In the present study, we explored differential neural activation in children and adolescents with ADHD and in healthy controls using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with the categorical n-back task (CN-BT), which maximized demands for executive reasoning while holding memory demands constant. A total of 33 drug-naive, right-handed male ADHD without comorbidity (mean age 9.9±2.4 years) and 27 right-handed, healthy male controls (mean age 10.9±2.7 years) were recruited in the present study. Event-related fMRI was used to study differences in brain activity during the CN-BT between the two groups. The two groups did not differ in their accuracy in the CN-BT, although the ADHD patients showed significantly shorter reaction times to correct responses than did the controls. During the CN-BT, both ADHD patients and controls showed significant positive and negative activations by the correct responses, mainly in the sensory-motor pathways and the striato-cerebellum circuit. Additionally, the ADHD patients showed significantly higher activation in the bilateral globus pallidus and the right hippocampus compared with the controls. There was also a positive correlation between hyperactivation of the left globus pallidus and the reaction time to correct responses in ADHD. In contrast to controls, ADHD patients showed neural hyperactivation in the striatum and mediotemporal areas during a working memory task involving categorization. Hyperfunction in these areas might be the pathophysiological foundation of ADHD, related to the deficits of working memory and the impulsive symptoms. ",

Visual cortex","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with prominent impairments in sociocommunicative abilities, which have been linked to anomalous brain network organization. Despite ample evidence of atypical long-distance connectivity, the literature on local connectivity remains small and divergent. We used resting-state functional MRI regional homogeneity (ReHo) as a local connectivity measure in comparative analyses across several well-matched low-motion subsamples from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange and in-house data, with a grand total of 147 ASD and 184 typically developing (TD) participants, ages 7-18 years. We tested for group differences in each subsample, with additional focus on the difference between eyes-open and eyes-closed resting states. Despite selection of highest quality data and tight demographic and motion matching between groups and across samples, few effects in exactly identical loci (voxels) were found across samples. However, there was gross consistency across all eyes-open samples of local overconnectivity (ASD > TD) in posterior, visual regions. There was also gross consistency of local underconnectivity (ASD < TD) in cingulate gyrus, although exact loci varied between mid/posterior and anterior sections. While all eyes-open datasets showed the described gross similarities, the pattern of group differences for participants scanned with eyes closed was different, with local overconnectivity in ASD in posterior cingulate gyrus, but underconnectivity in some visual regions. Our findings suggest that fMRI local connectivity measures may be relatively susceptible to site and cohort variability and that some previous inconsistencies in the ASD ReHo literature may be reconciled by more careful consideration of eye status.

We investigated whether amygdala mood-congruent responses to emotional stimuli in depressed patients are correlated with anhedonic symptoms at automatic levels of processing. We measured amygdala responsiveness to subliminally presented sad and happy facial expressions in depressed patients and matched healthy controls using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Amygdala responsiveness was compared between patients and healthy controls within a 2 (group) x 2 (emotion) design. In addition, we correlated patients' amygdala responsiveness to sad and happy facial stimuli with self-report questionnaire measures of anhedonia. We included 35 patients and 35 controls in our study. As in previous studies, we observed a strong emotion x group interaction in the bilateral amygdala: depressed patients showed greater amygdala responses to sad than happy faces, whereas healthy controls responded more strongly to happy than sad faces. The lack of automatic right amygdala responsiveness to happy faces in depressed patients was associated with higher physical anhedonia scores. Almost all depressed patients were taking antidepressant medications. We replicated our previous finding of depressed patients showing automatic amygdala mood-congruent biases in terms of enhanced reactivity to negative emotional stimuli and reduced activity to positive emotional stimuli. The altered amygdala processing of positive stimuli in patients was associated with anhedonia scores. The results indicate that reduced amygdala responsiveness to positive stimuli may contribute to anhedonic symptoms due to reduced/inappropriate salience attribution to positive information at very early processing levels.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus","Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a significant risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and the acceleration of MCI to dementia. The high glucose level induce disturbance of neurovascular (NV) coupling is suggested to be one potential mechanism, however, the neuroimaging evidence is still lacking. To assess the NV decoupling pattern in early diabetic status, 33 T2DM without MCI patients and 33 healthy control subjects were prospectively enrolled. Then, they underwent resting state functional MRI and arterial spin labeling imaging to explore the hub-based networks and to estimate the coupling of voxel-wise cerebral blood flow (CBF)-degree centrality (DC), CBF-mean amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mALFF) and CBF- mean regional homogeneity (mReHo). We further evaluated the relationship between NV coupling pattern and cognitive performance (false discovery rate corrected). T2DM without MCI patients displayed significant decrease in the absolute CBF-mALFF, CBF-mReHo coupling of CBFnetwork and in the CBF-DC coupling of DCnetwork. Besides, networks which involved CBF and DC hubs mainly located in the default mode network (DMN). Furthermore, less severe disease and better cognitive performance in T2DM patients were significantly correlated with higher coupling of CBF-DC, CBF-mALFF or CBF-mReHo, especially for the cognitive dimensions of general function and executive function. Thus, coupling of CBF-DC, CBF-mALFF and CBF-mReHo may serve as promising indicators to reflect NV coupling state and to explain the T2DM related early cognitive impairment. ",

Functional magnetic resonanc image (fMRI) was performed in 19 IAD college students and 19 controls under resting state. ReHo method was used to analyze the differences between the average ReHo in two groups. The following increased ReHo brain regions were found in IAD group compared with control group: cerebellum, brainstem, right cingulate gyrus, bilateral parahippocampus, right frontal lobe (rectal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus), left superior frontal gyrus, left precuneus, right postcentral gyrus, right middle occipital gyrus, right inferior temporal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus. The decreased ReHo brain regions were not found in the IAD group compared with the control group. There are abnormalities in regional homogeneity in IAD college students compared with the controls and enhancement of synchronization in most encephalic regions can be found. The results reflect the functional change of brain in IAD college students. The connections between the enhancement of synchronization among cerebellum, brainstem, limbic lobe, frontal lobe and apical lobe may be relative to reward pathways. ",
pmid_22456823,Reduced amygdala response in youths with disruptive behavior disorders and psychopathic traits: decreased emotional response versus increased top-down attention to nonemotional features.,,"Amygdala dysfunction has been reported to exist in youths and adults with psychopathic traits. However, there has been disagreement as to whether this dysfunction reflects a primary emotional deficit or is secondary to atypical attentional control. The authors examined the validity of the contrasting predictions. Participants were 15 children and adolescents (ages 10–17 years) with both disruptive behavior disorders and psychopathic traits and 17 healthy comparison youths. Functional MRI was used to assess the response of the amygdala and regions implicated in top-down attentional control (the dorsomedial and lateral frontal cortices) to emotional expression under conditions of high and low attentional load. Relative to youths with disruptive behavior disorders and psychopathic traits, healthy comparison subjects showed a significantly greater increase in the typical amygdala response to fearful expressions under low relative to high attentional load conditions. There was also a selective inverse relationship between the response to fearful expressions under low attentional load and the callous-unemotional component (but not the narcissism or impulsivity component) of psychopathic traits. In contrast, the two groups did not differ in the significant recruitment of the dorsomedial and lateral frontal cortices as a function of attentional load. Youths with disruptive behavior disorders and psychopathic traits showed reduced amygdala responses to fearful expressions under low attentional load but no indications of increased recruitment of regions implicated in top-down attentional control. These findings suggest that the emotional deficit observed in youths with disruptive behavior disorders and psychopathic traits is primary and not secondary to increased top-down attention to nonemotional stimulus features.

pmid_21232571,State of expectancy modulates the neural response to visual food stimuli in humans.,,"Human brain imaging studies demonstrate distributed activation of limbic, paralimbic and sensory systems to food and food-associated cues. Activity in this circuit may be modulated by internal factors, such as hunger, and cognitive factors. Anticipation to eat is one such factor, which likely impacts consummatory behavior. Here, the neural substrates of food expectancy were identified in 10 healthy male participants who underwent two whole-brain functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans on separate days. Fasted subjects viewed images of food and scenery, in two counterbalanced states. During one condition, subjects were 'expecting' to eat right after the scan and during the other they were 'not expecting' to eat for 1 h after the scan. Food pictures compared with scenery yielded bilateral activation in visual areas as well as in the left insula and amygdala in both conditions. The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and putamen were additionally activated in the 'not expecting' condition while right orbitofrontal cortex activity was enhanced in the 'expecting' condition. These data suggest that cognitive manipulations affect the response to food cues in the prefrontal cortex, in areas involved in the planning and control of motivated behaviors, while the amygdala and insula responded equally in both conditions, consistent with a more basic role in homeostatically driven appetitive behavior.

internet gaming disorder
stroop","Attentional bias for drug-related stimuli is a key characteristic for drug addiction. Characterizing the relationship between attentional bias and brain reactivity to Internet gaming-related stimuli may help in identifying the neural substrates that critical to Internet gaming disorder (IGD). 19 IGD and 21 healthy control (HC) subjects were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they were performing an addiction Stroop task. Compared with HC group, IGD subjects showed higher activations when facing Internet gaming-related stimuli in regions including the inferior parietal lobule, the middle occipital gyrus and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These brain areas were thought to be involved in selective attention, visual processing, working memory and cognitive control. The results demonstrated that compared with HC group, IGD subjects show impairment in both visual and cognitive control ability while dealing with gaming-related words. This finding might be helpful in understanding the underlying neural basis of IGD. ",
pmid_23518009,Where color rests: spontaneous brain activity of bilateral fusiform and lingual regions predicts object color knowledge performance.,,"Knowledge of the physical attributes of objects is commonly assumed to be distributed near their respective modality-specific brain regions. The exact neural correlates for such knowledge, especially how it is maintained in the resting state, are largely unknown. In the current study, we explored the intrinsic neural basis related to a specific type of object knowledge - color - by investigating the relationship between spontaneous brain activity and color knowledge behavioral performance. We correlated the regional amplitude of spontaneous low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF, a resting-state fMRI parameter) with healthy participants' performance on two object color knowledge tasks (object color verification and color attribute judgment). We found that ALFF in bilateral lingual and fusiform gyri and right inferior occipital gyrus reliably predicted participants' color knowledge performance (correlation coefficients=0.55-0.70), and that calcarine cortex showed a similar trend, although less stable. Furthermore, the ALFF-behavior correlations for other types of object knowledge (i.e. form, motion and sound) in these regions were minimal and significantly lower than those for color knowledge, suggesting that the effects in the observed regions were not merely due to general object processing. Furthermore, we showed that functional connectivity strengths of the lingual/fusiform and inferior occipital regions are significantly associated with color knowledge performance, indicating that they work as a network to support color knowledge processing or the acquisition of such knowledge. Our findings show the critical role of ventral medial occipito-temporal regions in processing or acquiring color knowledge and highlight the behavioral significance of spontaneous brain activity in the resting state.

pmid_18279364,Detection of unexpected events during spatial navigation in humans: bottom-up attentional system and neural mechanisms.,,"Navigation is a complex cognitive ability requiring the processing and integration of several different types of information extracted from the environment. While navigating, however, an unexpected event may suddenly occur, which individuals are required to detect promptly in order to apply an appropriate behavioural response. The alerting mechanism that is integral to the detection of unexpected events is referred to as the bottom-up attentional system. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the neural basis of bottom-up detection of unexpected events while individuals moved within a virtual environment. We identified activation within a right fronto-temporo-parietal network in response to unexpected events while navigating in this virtual environment. Furthermore, when an unexpected event requires an adjusted behavioural response, a region of the right ventrolateral pre-frontal cortex (areas 45 and 47/12) is selectively activated. Our data replicate earlier findings on the neural mechanisms underlying visual attention and extend these findings to the more complex real-life ability of spatial navigation, thereby suggesting that these neural mechanisms subserve the bottom-up attentional systems that are crucial for effective locomotion in real surroundings. ",
pmid_22457458,Effector selection precedes reach planning in the dorsal parietofrontal cortex.,,"Experimental evidence and computational modeling suggest that target selection for reaching is associated with the parallel encoding of multiple movement plans in the dorsomedial posterior parietal cortex (dmPPC) and the caudal part of the dorsal premotor cortex (PMdc). We tested the hypothesis that a similar mechanism also accounts for arm selection for unimanual reaching, with simultaneous and separate motor goal representations for the left and right arms existing in the right and left parietofrontal cortex, respectively. We recorded simultaneous electroencephalograms and functional MRI and studied a condition in which subjects had to select the appropriate arm for reaching based on the color of an appearing visuospatial target, contrasting it to a condition in which they had full knowledge of the arm to be used before target onset. We showed that irrespective of whether subjects had to select the arm or not, activity in dmPPC and PMdc was only observed contralateral to the reaching arm after target onset. Furthermore, the latency of activation in these regions was significantly delayed when arm selection had to be achieved during movement planning. Together, these results demonstrate that effector selection is not achieved through the simultaneous specification of motor goals tied to the two arms in bilateral parietofrontal cortex, but suggest that a motor goal is formed in these regions only after an arm is selected for action.

pmid_23227257,Hierarchical alteration of brain structural and functional networks in female migraine sufferers.,,"Little is known about the changes of brain structural and functional connectivity networks underlying the pathophysiology in migraine. We aimed to investigate how the cortical network reorganization is altered by frequent cortical overstimulation associated with migraine. Gray matter volumes and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging signal correlations were employed to construct structural and functional networks between brain regions in 43 female patients with migraine (PM) and 43 gender-matched healthy controls (HC) by using graph theory-based approaches. Compared with the HC group, the patients showed abnormal global topology in both structural and functional networks, characterized by higher mean clustering coefficients without significant change in the shortest absolute path length, which indicated that the PM lost optimal topological organization in their cortical networks. Brain hubs related to pain-processing revealed abnormal nodal centrality in both structural and functional networks, including the precentral gyrus, orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, thalamus, temporal pole of the middle temporal gyrus and the inferior parietal gyrus. Negative correlations were found between migraine duration and regions with abnormal centrality. Furthermore, the dysfunctional connections in patients' cortical networks formed into a connected component and three dysregulated modules were identified involving pain-related information processing and motion-processing visual networks. Our results may reflect brain alteration dynamics resulting from migraine and suggest that long-term and high-frequency headache attacks may cause both structural and functional connectivity network reorganization. The disrupted information exchange between brain areas in migraine may be reshaped into a hierarchical modular structure progressively. ",
pmid_23990079,An fMRI study of reward circuitry in patients with minimal or extensive history of major depression.,,"Functional abnormalities in regions associated with reward processing are apparent in people with depression, but the extent to which disease burden impacts on the processing of reward is unknown. This research examined the neural correlates of reward processing in patients with major depressive disorder and varying degrees of past illness burden. Twenty-nine depressed patients and twenty-five healthy subjects with no lifetime history of psychiatric illness completed the study. Subsets of fourteen patients were presenting for first lifetime treatment of a depressive episode, and fifteen patients had at least three treated episodes of depression. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to study blood oxygen level-dependent signals during the performance of a contingency reversal reward paradigm. The results identified group differences in the response to punishers bilaterally in the orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal regions. In addition, areas such as the nucleus accumbens, anterior cingulate and ventral prefrontal cortices were activated greatest by controls during reward processing, less by patients early in the course of illness and least by patients with highly recurrent illness-suggesting that these areas are sensitive to the impact of disease burden and repeated episodes of depression. Reward processing in people with depression may be associated with diminished signaling of incentive salience, a reduction in the formation of reward-related associations and heightened sensitivities for negatively valenced stimuli, all of which could contribute to symptoms of depression.

pmid_16741204,Parietal attentional system aberrations during target detection in adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: event-related fMRI evidence.,,"Directed attention, the ability to allocate and direct attention toward a salient stimulus, is impaired in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This construct is often assessed with target detection or oddball tasks, and individuals with ADHD perform poorly on such tasks. However, to date, the specific brain structures or neural mechanisms underlying target detection dysfunction in individuals with ADHD have not been identified. The authors' goal was to investigate neural correlates of target detection dysfunction in ADHD using event-related fMRI. Behavioral and brain activation data were collected while subjects performed a visual oddball task. Participants included 14 right-handed male adolescents with ADHD (combined type) and 12 typically developing age- and handedness-matched male comparison subjects. Individuals with ADHD made significantly more errors of commission than comparison subjects. Further, relative to comparison subjects, individuals with ADHD showed significantly less activation in the bilateral parietal lobes (including the superior parietal gyrus and supramarginal and angular gyri of the inferior parietal lobe), right precuneus, and thalamus. Adolescents with ADHD demonstrated significant impairments in their ability to direct and allocate attentional resources. These difficulties were associated with significant aberrations in the parietal attentional system, which is known to play a significant role in attention shifting and detecting specific or salient targets. Thus, dysfunction in the parietal attentional system may play a significant role in the behavioral phenotype of ADHD. ",
pmid_22970898,Cue reactivity and its inhibition in pathological computer game players.,,"Despite a rising social relevance of pathological computer game playing, it remains unclear whether the neurobiological basis of this addiction-like behavioral disorder and substance-related addiction are comparable. In substance-related addiction, attentional bias and cue reactivity are often observed. We conducted a functional magnetic resonance study using a dot probe paradigm with short-presentation (attentional bias) and long-presentation (cue reactivity) trials in eight male pathological computer game players (PCGPs) and nine healthy controls (HCs). Computer game-related and neutral computer-generated pictures, as well as pictures from the International Affective Picture System with positive and neutral valence, served as stimuli. PCGPs showed an attentional bias toward both game-related and affective stimuli with positive valence. In contrast, HCs showed no attentional bias effect at all. PCGPs showed stronger brain responses in short-presentation trials compared with HCs in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and anterior cingulate gyrus and in long-presentation trials in lingual gyrus. In an exploratory post hoc functional connectivity analyses, for long-presentation trials, connectivity strength was higher between right inferior frontal gyrus, which was associated with inhibition processing in previous studies, and cue reactivity-related regions (left orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum) in PCGPs. We observed behavioral and neural effects in PCGPs, which are comparable with those found in substance-related addiction. However, cue-related brain responses were depending on duration of cue presentation. Together with the connectivity result, these findings suggest that top-down inhibitory processes might suppress the cue reactivity-related neural activity in long-presentation trials. ",
pmid_26871535,Brain activations during pain: a neuroimaging meta-analysis of patients with pain and healthy controls.,,"In response to recent publications from pain neuroimaging experiments, there has been a debate about the existence of a primary pain region in the brain. Yet, there are few meta-analyses providing assessments of the minimum cerebral denominators of pain. Here, we used a statistical meta-analysis method, called activation likelihood estimation, to define (1) core brain regions activated by pain per se, irrelevant of pain modality, paradigm, or participants and (2) activation likelihood estimation commonalities and differences between patients with chronic pain and healthy individuals. A subtraction analysis of 138 independent data sets revealed that the minimum denominator for activation across pain modalities and paradigms included the right insula, secondary sensory cortex, and right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Common activations for healthy subjects and patients with pain alike included the thalamus, ACC, insula, and cerebellum. A comparative analysis revealed that healthy individuals were more likely to activate the cingulum, thalamus, and insula. Our results point toward the central role of the insular cortex and ACC in pain processing, irrelevant of modality, body part, or clinical experience; thus, furthering the importance of ACC and insular activation as key regions for the human experience of pain. ",
pmid_22437053,Decoding the role of the insula in human cognition: functional parcellation and large-scale reverse inference.,,"Recent work has indicated that the insula may be involved in goal-directed cognition, switching between networks, and the conscious awareness of affect and somatosensation. However, these findings have been limited by the insula's remarkably high base rate of activation and considerable functional heterogeneity. The present study used a relatively unbiased data-driven approach combining resting-state connectivity-based parcellation of the insula with large-scale meta-analysis to understand how the insula is anatomically organized based on functional connectivity patterns as well as the consistency and specificity of the associated cognitive functions. Our findings support a tripartite subdivision of the insula and reveal that the patterns of functional connectivity in the resting-state analysis appear to be relatively conserved across tasks in the meta-analytic coactivation analysis. The function of the networks was meta-analytically ""decoded"" using the Neurosynth framework and revealed that while the dorsoanterior insula is more consistently involved in human cognition than ventroanterior and posterior networks, each parcellated network is specifically associated with a distinct function. Collectively, this work suggests that the insula is instrumental in integrating disparate functional systems involved in processing affect, sensory-motor processing, and general cognition and is well suited to provide an interface between feelings, cognition, and action.

pmid_22720174,Widespread structural and functional connectivity changes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: insights from advanced neuroimaging research.,,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe neurodegenerative disease principally affecting motor neurons. Besides motor symptoms, a subset of patients develop cognitive disturbances or even frontotemporal dementia (FTD), indicating that ALS may also involve extramotor brain regions. Both neuropathological and neuroimaging findings have provided further insight on the widespread effect of the neurodegeneration on brain connectivity and the underlying neurobiology of motor neurons degeneration. However, associated effects on motor and extramotor brain networks are largely unknown. Particularly, neuropathological findings suggest that ALS not only affects the frontotemporal network but rather is part of a wide clinicopathological spectrum of brain disorders known as TAR-DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) proteinopathies. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge concerning the neuropsychological and neuropathological sequelae of TDP-43 proteinopathies, with special focus on the neuroimaging findings associated with cognitive change in ALS.

pmid_20668188,Multiple mechanisms of consciousness: the neural correlates of emotional awareness.,,"Emotional stimuli, including facial expressions, are thought to gain rapid and privileged access to processing resources in the brain. Despite this access, we are conscious of only a fraction of the myriad of emotion-related cues we face everyday. It remains unclear, therefore, what the relationship is between activity in neural regions associated with emotional representation and the phenomenological experience of emotional awareness. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and binocular rivalry to delineate the neural correlates of awareness of conflicting emotional expressions in humans. Behaviorally, fearful faces were significantly more likely to be perceived than disgusted or neutral faces. Functionally, increased activity was observed in regions associated with facial expression processing, including the amygdala and fusiform gyrus during emotional awareness. In contrast, awareness of neutral faces and suppression of fearful faces were associated with increased activity in dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior parietal cortices. The amygdala showed increased functional connectivity with ventral visual system regions during fear awareness and increased connectivity with perigenual prefrontal cortex (pgPFC; Brodmann's area 32/10) when fear was suppressed. Despite being prioritized for awareness, emotional items were associated with reduced activity in areas considered critical for consciousness. Contributions to consciousness from bottom-up and top-down neural regions may be additive, such that increased activity in specialized regions within the extended ventral visual system may reduce demands on a frontoparietal system important for awareness. The possibility is raised that interactions between pgPFC and the amygdala, previously implicated in extinction, may also influence whether or not an emotional stimulus is accessible to consciousness.

We extended the study base of the registry of the province of Turin, Italy, to subjects aged 30-49 years in the period 1999-2001 to estimate the incidences of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Diagnosis of type 1 diabetes was based on permanent insulin treatment or a fasting C-peptide level < or =0.20 nmol/l or islet cell (ICA) or GAD (GADA) antibody positivities. We identified 1,135 case subjects with high completeness of ascertainment (99%), giving an incidence rate of 58.0 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI 54.7-61.5). The incidence of type 1 diabetes was 7.3 per 100,000 person-years (6.2-8.6), comparable with the rates in subjects aged 0-14 and 15-29 years (10.3 [9.5-11.2] and 6.8 [6.3-7.4]). Male subjects had a higher risk than female subjects for both type 1 (rate ratio [RR] 1.70 [95% CI 1.21-2.38]) and type 2 (2.10 [1.84-2.40]) diabetes. ICA and/or GADA positivities were found in 16% of the cohort. In logistic regression, variables independently associated with autoimmune diabetes were age 30-39 years (odds ratio [OR] 2.39 [95% CI 1.40-4.07]), fasting C-peptide <0.60 nmol/l (3.09 [1.74-5.5]), and BMI <26 kg/m2 (2.17 [1.22-3.85]). Risk of type 1 diabetes between age 30 and 49 years is similar to that found in the same area between age 15 and 29 years. Further studies are required to allow geographical comparisons of risks of both childhood and adulthood autoimmune diabetes, the latter being probably higher than previously believed. ",
pmid_12146684,Working memory for complex figures: an fMRI comparison of letter and fractal n-back tasks.,,"n-back letter and fractal tasks were administered to 11 participants during functional magnetic resonance imaging to test process specificity theories of prefrontal cortex (PFC) function and assess task validity. Tasks were matched on accuracy, but fractal n-back responses were slower and more conservative. Maintenance (1-back minus 0-back) activated inferior parietal and dorsolateral PFC, with additional activation in right ventrolateral PFC during letter n-back and left lingual gyrus during fractal n-back. Maintenance plus manipulation (2-back minus 0-back) activated inferior parietal, Broca's area, insula, and dorsolateral and ventral PFC, with greater right dorsolateral PFC activation for letter n-back. Manipulation only (2-back minus 1-back) produced additional and equivalent dorsolateral PFC and anterior cingulate activation in both tasks. Results support fractal n-back validity and indicate substantial overlap in working memory functions of dorsal and ventral PFC. ",

This study aims to investigate the effect of 6 months of Baduanjin exercise on brain structure and cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The MCI older adults were randomly assigned into either Baduanjin training, brisk walking training or usual physical activity control group. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Wechsler Memory Scale-Chinese Revised (WMS-CR) were applied to measure gray matter volume (GMV), global cognitive ability and memory at baseline and end of intervention. Compared to usual physical activity, Baduanjin exercise significantly improved MoCA, WMS-CR scores, WMS-MQ, and mental control and comprehension memory subscores of the WMS-CR; significantly increased the GMV in the temporal gyrus, frontal gyrus, parietal gyrus, medial occipital gyrus, cingulate gyrus and angular gyrus after 6 months of intervention. Compared to brisk walking, Baduanjin significantly improved MoCA scores and picture reproduction subscores of memory, and significantly increased the GMV in the right frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, occipital gyrus. Furthermore, the increased GMV in the right medial temporal gyrus was significantly associated with improvement in the MoCA scores. The present study suggested that regular Baduanjin training could have a positive effect in increasing brain gray matter and improving cognitive function in older adults with MCI. ",
pmid_18641668,The parietal cortex and episodic memory: an attentional account.,,"The contribution of the parietal cortex to episodic memory is a fascinating scientific puzzle. On the one hand, parietal lesions do not normally yield severe episodic-memory deficits; on the other hand, parietal activations are seen frequently in functional-neuroimaging studies of episodic memory. A review of these two categories of evidence suggests that the answer to the puzzle requires us to distinguish between the contributions of dorsal and ventral parietal regions and between the influence of top-down and bottom-up attention on memory.

pmid_14527597,FMRI investigation of cross-cultural music comprehension.,,"The popular view of music as a ""universal"" language ignores the privileged position of the cultural insider in comprehending musical information unique to their own tradition. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that listeners would demonstrate different neural activity in response to culturally familiar and unfamiliar music and that those differences may be affected by the extent of subjects' formal musical training. Just as familiar languages have been shown to use distinct brain processes, we hypothesized that an analogous difference might be found in music and that it may depend in part on subjects' formal musical knowledge. Using fMRI we compared the activation patterns of professional musicians and untrained controls reared in the United States as they listened to music from their culture (Western) and from an unfamiliar culture (Chinese). No overall differences in activation were observed for either subject group in response to the two musical styles, although there were differences in recall performance based on style and there were activation differences based on training. Trained listeners demonstrated additional activation in the right STG for both musics and in the right and left midfrontal regions for Western music and Chinese music, respectively. Our findings indicate that listening to culturally different musics may activate similar neural resources but with dissimilar results in recall performance. ",
pmid_19748075,Automatic mood-congruent amygdala responses to masked facial expressions in major depression.,,"Cognitive theories of depression predict mood-congruent negative biases already at automatic stages of processing, although several behavioral studies seem to contradict this notion. That is, depression should potentiate emotional reactivity to negative emotional cues, whereas it should reduce reactivity in response to positive emotional stimuli. Assessing neurobiological substrates of automatic emotion processing might be a more sensitive challenge for automatic negative bias in depression than behavioral measures. In 30 acutely depressed inpatients and 26 healthy control subjects, automatic amygdala responses to happy and sad facial expressions were assessed by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 3 Tesla. To examine automatic responses, a presentation paradigm using subliminal, backward-masked stimuli was employed. A detection task was administered to assess participants' awareness of the masked emotional faces presented in the fMRI experiment. Detection performance was at chance level for both patients and healthy control subjects, suggesting that the neurobiological reactions took place in absence of conscious awareness of the emotional stimuli. A robust emotion by group interaction was observed in the right amygdala. Whereas healthy control subjects demonstrated stronger responses to happy faces, depressed patients showed the opposite. Furthermore, amygdala responsiveness to happy facial expression was negatively correlated with current depression severity. Depressed patients exhibit potentiated amygdala reactivity to masked negative stimuli along with a reduced responsiveness to masked positive stimuli compared with healthy individuals. Thus, depression is characterized by mood-congruent processing of emotional stimuli in the amygdala already at an automatic level of processing. ",
pmid_10400068,Music effects on event-related potentials of humans on the basis of cultural environment.,,"Auditory oddball responses were recorded from Turkish subjects in a silent environment or superimposed on white noise, or music played with violoncello or a similar music played with ney, a reed flute frequently listened by the Turkish population. P3 amplitudes with ney music in the background were significantly larger than both the white noise and violoncello backgrounds. The topography of the P3 response changed significantly between the ney and silent background conditions, indicating a relatively higher participation of frontal areas during hearing ney. Our results showed that hearing music of a familiar style increases the allocation of attentional resources during memory updating processes which is supposed to determine the P3 amplitude, and therefore showed the effects of cultural environment on the cognitive processes.

pmid_18752414,Reduced ventrolateral fMRI response during observation of emotional gestures related to the degree of dopaminergic impairment in Parkinson disease.,,"Recent findings point to a perceptive impairment of emotional facial expressions in patients diagnosed with Parkinson disease (PD). In these patients, administration of dopamine can modulate emotional facial recognition. We used fMRI to investigate differences in the functional activation in response to emotional and nonemotional gestures between PD patients and age-matched healthy controls (HC). In addition, we used PET to evaluate the striatal dopamine transporter availability (DAT) with [(11)C]d-threo-methylphenidate in the patient group. Patients showed an average decrease to 26% in DAT when compared to age-corrected healthy references. Reduction in the DAT of the left putamen correlated not only with motor impairment but also with errors in emotional gesture recognition. In comparison to HC, PD patients showed a specific decrease in activation related to emotional gesture observation in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and the right superior temporal sulcus. Moreover, the less DAT present in the left putamen, the lower the activation in the left VLPFC. We conclude that a loss of dopaminergic neurotransmission in the putamen results in a reduction of ventrolateral prefrontal access involved in the recognition of emotional gestures. ",
pmid_12968182,Cellular networks underlying human spatial navigation.,,"Place cells of the rodent hippocampus constitute one of the most striking examples of a correlation between neuronal activity and complex behaviour in mammals. These cells increase their firing rates when the animal traverses specific regions of its surroundings, providing a context-dependent map of the environment. Neuroimaging studies implicate the hippocampus and the parahippocampal region in human navigation. However, these regions also respond selectively to visual stimuli. It thus remains unclear whether rodent place coding has a homologue in humans or whether human navigation is driven by a different, visually based neural mechanism. We directly recorded from 317 neurons in the human medial temporal and frontal lobes while subjects explored and navigated a virtual town. Here we present evidence for a neural code of human spatial navigation based on cells that respond at specific spatial locations and cells that respond to views of landmarks. The former are present primarily in the hippocampus, and the latter in the parahippocampal region. Cells throughout the frontal and temporal lobes responded to the subjects' navigational goals and to conjunctions of place, goal and view. ",
pmid_29433612,Effect of electroconvulsive therapy on hippocampal and amygdala volumes: systematic review and meta-analysis.,,"Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective treatments for depression, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Animal studies have shown that electroconvulsive shock induced neuroplastic changes in the hippocampus. Aims To summarise volumetric magnetic resonance imaging studies investigating the effects of ECT on limbic brain structures. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess volumetric changes of each side of the hippocampus and amygdala before and after ECT. Standardised mean difference (SMD) was calculated. A total of 8 studies (n = 193) were selected for our analyses. Both right and left hippocampal and amygdala volumes increased after ECT. Meta-regression analyses revealed that age, percentage of those responding and percentage of those in remission were negatively associated with volume increases in the left hippocampus. ECT increased brain volume in the limbic structures. The clinical relevance of volume increase needs further investigation. Declaration of interest None. ",
pmid_17448605,Temporal modeling demonstrates preserved overlearning processes in schizophrenia: an fMRI study.,,"Working memory (WM) deficits are a core feature of schizophrenia. However, it has not been examined whether these deficits are related to altered temporal dynamics of information acquisition and changes in executive cognitive control. Therefore, the present study intended to quantify and model the dynamic process of information acquisition during continuous overlearning of WM information. It also aimed at investigating the relation between overlearning-associated change in behavioral performance and brain activity. Thirteen schizophrenic patients and 13 healthy volunteers were studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a recently developed overlearning paradigm [Koch K, Wagner G, von Consbruch K, Nenadic I, Schultz C, Ehle C, Reichenbach J, Sauer H, Schlösser R (2006) Temporal changes in neural activation during practice of information retrieval from short-term memory: An fMRI study. Brain Res 1107:140-150]. Consistent with the earlier study, short-term learning of stimulus material was associated with significant performance improvements and exponential signal decreases in a fronto-parieto-cerebellar network both in schizophrenic patients and in healthy volunteers. Against expectation patients exhibited stronger signal decreases relative to controls in anterior cingulate (Brodmann area (BA) 32), middle and superior temporal (BA 37, BA 22), superior frontal (BA 8/9, BA 6) and posterior parietal regions (BA 40). Furthermore, the individually modeled exponential decay rate of the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was significantly correlated with exponential decrease in mean behavioral response times in healthy controls while a statistical trend emerged in patients. A relative hyperactivation in the patient group was observable only at the start of the learning process and diminished with continued overlearning. This effect might indicate a gradual reduction of recruited neuronal resources and a practice-associated activation normalization in patients with schizophrenia. Our data suggest that in subacute patients learning and associated decreases in cerebral activation brought about by short-term practice are left unimpaired. ",
pmid_18940230,Atypical empathic responses in adolescents with aggressive conduct disorder: a functional MRI investigation.,,"Because youth with aggressive conduct disorder (CD) often inflict pain on others, it is important to determine if they exhibit atypical empathic responses to viewing others in pain. In this initial functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, eight adolescents with aggressive CD and eight matched controls with no CD symptoms were scanned while watching animated visual stimuli depicting other people experiencing pain or not experiencing pain. Furthermore, these situations involved either an individual whose pain was caused by accident or an individual whose pain was inflicted on purpose by another person. After scanning, participants rated how painful the situations were. In both groups the perception of others in pain was associated with activation of the pain matrix, including the ACC, insula, somatosensory cortex, supplementary motor area and periaqueductal gray. The pain matrix was activated to a specific extent in participants with CD, who also showed significantly greater amygdala, striatal, and temporal pole activation. When watching situations in which pain was intentionally inflicted, control youth exhibited signal increase in the medial prefrontal cortex, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and right temporo-parietal junction, whereas youth with CD only exhibited activation in the insula and precentral gyrus. Furthermore, connectivity analyses demonstrated that youth with CD exhibited less amygdala/prefrontal coupling when watching pain inflicted by another than did control youth. These preliminary findings suggest that youth with aggressive CD exhibit an atypical pattern of neural response to viewing others in pain that should be explored in further studies. ",

multivariate pattern analysis","Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been widely used to treat the major depressive disorder (MDD), especially for treatment-resistant depression. However, the neuroanatomical basis of ECT remains an open problem. In our study, we combined the voxel-based morphology (VBM), resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and granger causality analysis (GCA) to identify the longitudinal changes of structure and function in 23 MDD patients before and after ECT. In addition, multivariate pattern analysis using linear support vector machine (SVM) was applied to classify 23 depressed patients from 25 gender, age and education matched healthy controls. VBM analysis revealed the increased gray matter volume of left superficial amygdala after ECT. The following RSFC and GCA analyses further identified the enhanced functional connectivity between left amygdala and left fusiform face area (FFA) and effective connectivity from FFA to amygdala after ECT, respectively. Moreover, SVM-based classification achieved an accuracy of 83.33%, a sensitivity of 82.61% and a specificity of 84% by leave-one-out cross-validation. Our findings indicated that ECT may facilitate the neurogenesis of amygdala and selectively enhance the feedforward cortical-subcortical connectivity from FFA to amygdala. This study may shed new light on the pathological mechanism of MDD and may provide the neuroanatomical basis for ECT. ",
pmid_21084608,Strengthening of top-down frontal cognitive control networks underlying the development of inhibitory control: a functional magnetic resonance imaging effective connectivity study.,,"The ability to voluntarily inhibit responses to task-irrelevant stimuli, which is a fundamental component of cognitive control, has a protracted development through adolescence. Previous human developmental imaging studies have found immaturities in localized brain activity in children and adolescents. However, little is known about how these regions integrate with age to form the distributed networks known to support cognitive control. In the present study, we used Granger causality analysis to characterize developmental changes in effective connectivity underlying inhibitory control (antisaccade task) compared with reflexive responses (prosaccade task) in human participants. By childhood, few top-down connectivities were evident with increased parietal interconnectivity. By adolescence, connections from prefrontal cortex increased and parietal interconnectivity decreased. From adolescence to adulthood, there was evidence of increased number and strength of frontal connections to cortical regions as well as subcortical regions. Together, results suggest that developmental improvements in inhibitory control may be supported by age-related enhancements in top-down effective connectivity between frontal, oculomotor, and subcortical regions.

This prospective experimental pilot study examined the effects of DMPA on food motivation centers utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in eight nonobese, ovulatory subjects. fMRI blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal was measured using a 3-Tesla Scanner while participants viewed images of high-calorie foods, low-calorie foods and nonfood objects. fMRI scans were performed at baseline and 8 weeks after participants received one intramuscular dose of DMPA 150 mg. fMRI data were analyzed using the FMRIB Software Library. Changes in adiposity and circulating leptin and ghrelin levels were also measured. There was a greater BOLD signal response to food cues in brain regions associated with food motivation (anterior cingulate gyrus, orbitofrontal cortex) 8 weeks after DMPA administration compared to baseline (z>2.3, p<.05 whole-brain analysis clustered corrected). No statistically significant change was detected in circulating leptin or ghrelin levels or fat mass 8 weeks after DMPA administration. Analysis of differences in food motivation may guide the development of interventions to prevent weight gain in DMPA users. These data support a neural origin as one of the mechanisms underlying weight gain in DMPA users and may guide future research examining weight gain and contraception. ",

Wanting and liking","Rates of adolescent obesity and overweight are high. The offspring of overweight parents are at increased risk of becoming obese later in life. Investigating neural correlates of familial obesity risk and current overweight status in adolescence could help identify biomarkers that predict future obesity and that may serve as novel targets for obesity interventions. Our primary aim was to use functional MRI to compare neural responses to words denoting high or low energy density (ED) foods and non-foods, in currently lean adolescents at higher compared with lower familial risk for obesity, and in overweight compared with lean adolescents. Secondary aims were to assess group differences in subjective appetite when viewing food and non-food words, and in objective ad libitum intake of high-ED foods in a laboratory setting. We recruited 36 adolescents (14-19y), of whom 10 were (obese/overweight ""overweight""), 16 lean with obese/overweight mothers (lean high-risk, ""lean-HR""), and 10 lean with lean mothers (lean low-risk, ""lean-LR""). All underwent fMRI scanning while they viewed words representing high-ED foods, low-ED foods, or non-foods, and provided appetitive ratings in response to each word stimulus. They then consumed a multi-item ad libitum buffet meal. Food compared with non-food words activated a distributed emotion/reward system including insula and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Participants who were at increasing risk for obesity exhibited progressively weaker activation of an attentional/regulatory system including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsal ACC, and basal ganglia nuclei (activation was greatest in lean-LR, intermediate in lean-HR, and weakest in the overweight group). These group differences were most apparent for neural responses to high-compared with low-ED foods. Lean-HR (compared with lean-LR and overweight) adolescents reported greater desire for high-ED foods. Meal intake was greatest for the overweight, then lean-HR, then lean-LR groups. Adolescents at higher obesity risk exhibited reduced neural responses to high-ED food cues in a neural system that subserves attention and self-regulation. They also reported heightened appetitive responses to high-ED cues. Interventions that promote the capacity for self-regulation could prevent youth who have a familial predisposition for obesity from translating risk into reality. ",
pmid_16631130,Functional correlates of verbal memory deficits emerging during nicotine withdrawal in abstinent adolescent cannabis users.,,"Cannabis remains the most widely used illicit substance by adolescents and is typically consumed by this population in the context of ongoing tobacco use. Human studies have shown that both cannabis and tobacco exert effects on cognitive function; however, little is known about possible interacting effects of these drugs on brain function and cognition during adolescent development. Verbal learning and memory were assessed in 20 adolescent users of tobacco and cannabis and 25 adolescent tobacco users with minimal history of cannabis use. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine brain function and functional connectivity while a subset of these subjects performed a verbal working memory task. Delayed recall of verbal stimuli deteriorated during nicotine withdrawal among cannabis users but not among comparison subjects. During high verbal working memory load, nicotine withdrawal selectively increased task-related activation of posterior cortical regions and was associated with disruption of frontoparietal connectivity in adolescent cannabis users relative to comparison subjects. These observations suggest that cannabis use during adolescent development may disrupt neurocircuitry supporting verbal memory formation and that deficits associated with disruption of these neurocircuits are unmasked during nicotine withdrawal.

pmid_20714062,An fMRI study of intra-individual functional topography in the human cerebellum.,,"Neuroimaging studies report cerebellar activation during both motor and non-motor paradigms, and suggest a functional topography within the cerebellum. Sensorimotor tasks activate the anterior lobe, parts of lobule VI, and lobule VIII, whereas higher-level tasks activate lobules VI and VII in the posterior lobe. To determine whether these activation patterns are evident at a single-subject level, we conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during five tasks investigating sensorimotor (finger tapping), language (verb generation), spatial (mental rotation), working memory (N-back), and emotional processing (viewing images from the International Affective Picture System). Finger tapping activated the ipsilateral anterior lobe (lobules IV-V) as well as lobules VI and VIII. Activation during verb generation was found in right lobules VII and VIIIA. Mental rotation activated left-lateralized clusters in lobules VII-VIIIA, VI-Crus I, and midline VIIAt. The N-back task showed bilateral activation in right lobules VI-Crus I and left lobules VIIB-VIIIA. Cerebellar activation was evident bilaterally in lobule VI while viewing arousing vs. neutral images. This fMRI study provides the first proof of principle demonstration that there is topographic organization of motor execution vs. cognitive/emotional domains within the cerebellum of a single individual, likely reflecting the anatomical specificity of cerebro-cerebellar circuits underlying different task domains. Inter-subject variability of motor and non-motor topography remains to be determined. ",

Resting state executive control network (RS-ECN) represents a novel approach to interrogate the integrity of brain areas underlying executive dysfunction. The present study aims to investigate RS-ECN in aMCI and examine a possible link between changes in brain functional connectivity and declines in executive function. aMCI individuals (n = 13) and healthy subjects (n = 16) underwent cognitive assessment including executive function and high field functional magnetic resonance imaging. Individual RS-ECN maps were estimated using a seed-based cross-correlation method. Between groups RS-ECN functional connectivity comparison was assessed using voxel-wise statistic parametric mapping. aMCI individuals had reduced RS-ECN connectivity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), bilaterally. In contrast, aMCI showed increased connectivity in ventral lateral and anterior prefrontal cortex, bilaterally. Connectivity strength was associated with executive function in the ACC (r = 0.6213, p = 0.023) and right DLPFC (r = 0.6454, p = 0.017). Coexistence between connectivity declines and recruitment of brain regions outside the RS-ECN as reported here fits a brain reserve conceptual framework in which brain networks undergo remodeling in aMCI individuals.

Mentalizing
Mirror system","The mentalizing system and mirror system are thought to play important roles in inferring the internal mental states of others - a process known as mentalizing. Autism spectrum condition (ASC) is associated with difficulties in mentalizing. The aim of this study was to determine whether the behavioural difficulties in mentalizing associated with ASC can be explained by changes in functional connectivity between the mentalizing and mirror system. We recruited 40 adult participants (20 with ASC and 20 typically-developing). Brain activity was monitored using functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants watched videos in which actors performed hand actions. The videos were shown in separate mentalizing and non-mentalizing blocks. During mentalizing blocks, participants were asked to indicate whether hand actions were clumsy or spiteful (i.e. to judge the intent of the action). During non-mentalizing blocks, participants indicated whether the actions were successful or unsuccessful (i.e. to judge the outcome of the action). Higher activity during the mentalizing blocks compared to non-mentalizing blocks was found in regions associated with the mentalizing system: the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), as well as in regions typically associated with the mirror system: the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the inferior parietal lobe (IPL). Next, functional connectivity between regions was evaluated as a function of task. During mentalizing blocks, there was increased functional connectivity between the dmPFC and the mirror system in typically developing participants. In contrast, there was no increase in functional connectivity between these regions in ASC participants. Connectivity between the dmPFC and IFG was negatively correlated with autistic traits. The reduced connectivity in ASC participants was consistent with behavioural performance on the mentalizing task, which was also negatively correlated with the level of autistic traits. Together, these data emphasise the importance of functional connectivity between the mentalizing and mirror systems when inferring social intentions and show that reduced connectivity between these systems may explain some of the behavioural difficulties experienced by adults with ASC.

Salience network","Human brain is a topologically complex network embedded in anatomical space, and anatomical distance may affect functional connectivity (FC) in schizophrenia. However, little is known if and how this effect occurs in adolescent-onset schizophrenia (AOS). We explored long- and short-range FC through resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in 48 first-episode, drug-naive AOS patients and 31 healthy controls, and we examined if these abnormalities could be utilized to separate patients from controls using receiver operating characteristic curves and support vector machines (SVM). Patients had increased long-range positive FC (lpFC) and short-range positive FC (spFC) in the right middle frontal gyrus and right superior medial prefrontal cortex within the anterior default mode network (DMN), decreased lpFC and spFC in several regions of the posterior DMN, and decreased lpFC within the important hubs of salience network (SN). The decreased lpFC in the left superior temporal gyrus was positively correlated with cognitive impairment. We found that SVM has high accuracy (up to 92.4%) in classifying patients and control. Disrupted anatomical distance would underlie network-level dysconnectivity, highlighting the importance of the DMN and SN in the neurodevelopment of schizophrenia. Abnormalities of long- and short-range FC in brain regions could discriminate patients from controls with high accuracy. ",
pmid_19846729,Mental training enhances attentional stability: neural and behavioral evidence.,,"The capacity to stabilize the content of attention over time varies among individuals, and its impairment is a hallmark of several mental illnesses. Impairments in sustained attention in patients with attention disorders have been associated with increased trial-to-trial variability in reaction time and event-related potential deficits during attention tasks. At present, it is unclear whether the ability to sustain attention and its underlying brain circuitry are transformable through training. Here, we show, with dichotic listening task performance and electroencephalography, that training attention, as cultivated by meditation, can improve the ability to sustain attention. Three months of intensive meditation training reduced variability in attentional processing of target tones, as indicated by both enhanced theta-band phase consistency of oscillatory neural responses over anterior brain areas and reduced reaction time variability. Furthermore, those individuals who showed the greatest increase in neural response consistency showed the largest decrease in behavioral response variability. Notably, we also observed reduced variability in neural processing, in particular in low-frequency bands, regardless of whether the deviant tone was attended or unattended. Focused attention meditation may thus affect both distracter and target processing, perhaps by enhancing entrainment of neuronal oscillations to sensory input rhythms, a mechanism important for controlling the content of attention. These novel findings highlight the mechanisms underlying focused attention meditation and support the notion that mental training can significantly affect attention and brain function. ",

It remains unclear if task-irrelevant threat modulates the response to a subsequent facial stimulus, and whether the amygdala's role in early threat perception is independent and direct, or modulatory. In 19 participants, crowds of emotional faces were followed by target faces and a rating task while simultaneous EEG-fMRI were recorded. In addition to conventional analyses, fMRI-informed EEG analyses and fMRI dynamic causal modeling (DCM) were performed. Fearful crowds reduced EEG N170 target face amplitudes and increased responses in a fMRI network comprising insula, amygdala and inferior frontal cortex. Multimodal analyses showed that amygdala response was present ∼60 ms before the right fusiform gyrus-derived N170. DCM indicated inhibitory connections from amygdala to fusiform gyrus, strengthened when fearful crowds preceded a target face. Results demonstrated the suppressing influence of task-irrelevant fearful crowds on subsequent face processing. The amygdala may be sensitive to task-irrelevant fearful crowds and subsequently strengthen its inhibitory influence on face-responsive fusiform N170 generators. This provides spatiotemporal evidence for a feedback mechanism of the amygdala by narrowing attention in order to focus on potential threats. ",
pmid_18829871,Disorder-specific dissociation of orbitofrontal dysfunction in boys with pure conduct disorder during reward and ventrolateral prefrontal dysfunction in boys with pure ADHD during sustained attention.,,"Among children, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder are often comorbid and overlap clinically. Neuropsychological evidence suggests that children with conduct disorder demonstrate more prominent motivational problems and children with ADHD demonstrate more prominent attention deficits relative to healthy comparison subjects. The purpose of the present study was to investigate disorder-specific abnormalities in the neurobiological correlates of motivation and sustained attention in children and adolescents with pure conduct disorder and children and adolescents with pure ADHD. Participants were male pediatric patients, ages 9-16 years, with noncomorbid conduct disorder (N=14) and noncomorbid ADHD, combined hyperactive-inattentive subtype (N=18), as well as age- and IQ-matched healthy comparison subjects (N=16). Both patient groups were medication naive. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to compare brain activation during a rewarded continuous performance task that measured sustained attention as well as the effects of reward on performance. During the sustained attention condition, patients with noncomorbid ADHD showed significantly reduced activation in the bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and increased activation in the cerebellum relative to patients with noncomorbid conduct disorder and healthy comparison subjects. Patients with noncomorbid conduct disorder showed decreased activation in paralimbic regions of the insula, hippocampus, and anterior cingulate as well as the cerebellum relative to patients with noncomorbid ADHD and healthy comparison subjects. However, during the reward condition, patients with noncomorbid conduct disorder showed disorder-specific underactivation in the right orbitofrontal cortex, while patients with noncomorbid ADHD showed disorder-specific dysfunction in the posterior cingulate gyrus. The findings revealed a process-related dissociation of prefrontal dysfunction in ADHD and conduct disorder patients. Attention-related dysfunction in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex was seen in ADHD patients, and reward-related dysfunction in the orbitofrontal cortex was seen in conduct disorder patients. These findings, together with the pattern of paralimbic dysfunction demonstrated among children with conduct disorder during sustained attention, support theories of abnormalities in orbitofrontal-paralimbic motivation networks in individuals with conduct disorder and, in contrast, ventrolateral fronto-cerebellar attention network dysfunction in individuals with ADHD.

Reduced fear conditioning has been proposed to underlie persistent antisocial development. However, we have recently shown that both DBD persisters and desisters are characterized by increased fear conditioning compared with healthy controls (HCs). In this study, we investigated whether brain function during fear extinction is associated with DBD subgroup-membership and psychopathic traits. Adolescents from a childhood arrestee cohort (mean age 17.6 years, s.d. 1.4) who met criteria for a DBD diagnosis during previous assessments were re-assessed and categorized as persistent DBD (n = 25) or desistent DBD (n = 25). Functional MRI during the extinction phase of a classical fear-conditioning task was used to compare regional brain function between these subgroups and 25 matched controls. Both DBD persisters and desisters showed hyperreactivity during fear extinction, when compared with HCs. Impulsive-irresponsible psychopathic traits were positively associated with responses in the fear neurocircuitry and mediated the association between neural activation and group membership. These results suggest that fear acquisition and fear extinction deficits may provide an endophenotype for an emotionally hyperreactive subtype of antisocial development. ",

This study used acupuncture twirling reinforcing, acupuncture twirling reducing, and acupuncture twirling uniform reinforcing-reducing manipulations to act on the bilateral TaiChong point of rats. The depth of acupuncture was 1.5-2 mm, and twisting was performed at a frequency of 60 times/min within ±360° for 3 min, followed by the needle being retained for 17 min. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed at the end of the intervention. Regional homogeneity and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations were used to assess the differences in brain regions in each group of rats, and the core brain region (left hypothalamus) among the differential brain regions was selected as the seed for functional connectivity analysis. (1) The anti-hypertensive effect was achieved by acupuncture manipulations, and the anti-hypertensive effect of twirling reducing manipulation on spontaneously hypertensive rats was better than that of twirling uniform reinforcing-reducing and twirling reinforcing manipulations. (2) After regional homogeneity and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations analyses, the hypothalamus, the brain region related to blood pressure, was activated in the twirling uniform reinforcing-reducing manipulation group; the corpus callosum and cerebellum were activated in the twirling reinforcing manipulation group; and the hypothalamus, olfactory bulb, corpus callosum, brainstem, globus pallidum, and striatum were activated in the twirling reducing manipulation group. (3) According to the functional connectivity analysis, different acupuncture manipulations increased the functional connections between seed points and the brainstem, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum, etc. These results suggest that acupuncture manipulations achieved the hypotensive effect and the twirling reducing manipulation had a better hypotensive effect on spontaneously hypertensive rats than twirling uniform reinforcing-reducing and twirling reinforcing manipulations; the central mechanism of the anti-hypertensive effect of twirling reinforcing and reducing manipulation may be related to the activation of brain regions associated with blood pressure regulation and the functional connections between them. Furthermore, brain regions involved in motor control, cognition, and hearing were also activated. We hypothesize that activation of these brain regions may help prevent or mitigate the onset and progression of hypertensive brain damage. ",

We further used the seed-based functional connectivity to explore the remote rfMRI connectivity in aMCI. The results revealed significantly lower local connectivity in the default network and higher local connectivity in the somatomotor network in aMCI patients. Abnormal remote connectivity relevant to local connectivity was primarily detectable within the default network (decrease) and in the somatomotor and attention networks (increase). The abnormalities in the remote (not local) default network connectivity were significantly associated with episodic memory performance in patients. These distance-related connectivity profiles illustrated a dysfunctional pattern in aMCI, which extended our knowledge of this pathological aging process. ",

Eighteen non-musicians volunteers were exposed to 60 structurally similar pieces of film music of 10 s length with high arousal ratings and either less positive or very positive valence ratings. Two similar sets of 30 pieces were created. Each of these was presented to half of the participants during the encoding session outside of the scanner, while all stimuli were used during the second recognition session inside the MRI-scanner. During fMRI each stimulation period (10 s) was followed by a 20 s resting period during which participants pressed either the ""old"" or the ""new"" button to indicate whether they had heard the piece before. Musical stimuli vs. silence activated the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, right insula, right middle frontal gyrus, bilateral medial frontal gyrus and the left anterior cerebellum. Old pieces led to activation in the left medial dorsal thalamus and left midbrain compared to new pieces. For recognized vs. not recognized old pieces a focused activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus and the left cerebellum was found. Positive pieces activated the left medial frontal gyrus, the left precuneus, the right superior frontal gyrus, the left posterior cingulate, the bilateral middle temporal gyrus, and the left thalamus compared to less positive pieces. Specific brain networks related to memory retrieval and emotional processing of symphonic film music were identified.

Evidence suggests that DMN could be segregated into multiple subnetworks with specific roles that underline different cognitive processes. However, the relative contributions of DMN subnetworks in the comorbidity of migraine and insomnia remain largely unknown. This study sought to identify altered functional connectivity (FC) profiles of DMN subnetworks in the comorbidity of migraine and insomnia. Direct group comparisons with healthy controls, followed by conjunction analyses, were used to identify shared FC alterations of DMN subnetworks. The shared FC changes of the DMN subnetworks in the migraine and insomnia groups were identified in the dorsomedial prefrontal and posteromedial cortex subnetworks. These shared FC changes were primarily associated with motor and somatosensory systems, and consistently found in patients with comorbid migraine and insomnia. Additionally, the magnitude of FC between the posteromedial cortex and postcentral gyrus correlated with insomnia duration in patients with comorbid migraine and insomnia. Our findings point to specific FC alterations of the DMN subnetwork in migraine and insomnia. The shared patterns of FC disturbance may be associated with the underlying mechanisms of the comorbidity of the two disorders. ",

Previous imaging studies of maintenance vs manipulation processes in WM have produced inconsistent results, which may have been due to methodological issues such as low statistical power and the use of insertion (subtraction) designs. In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study we used parametric versions of both a prototypical maintenance task (Sternberg) and a prototypical manipulation task (n-letter back task) in 21 healthy subjects. Increased signal correlated with load common for both tasks was found in bilateral dorsolateral and anterior prefrontal, left ventrolateral prefrontal, and bilateral parietal regions. Workload x task interactions were found in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for manipulation vs maintenance, but also for responding vs encoding (storage) in the maintenance task. Therefore, our data support a functional rather than a neuroanatomical distinction between maintenance and manipulation, given our finding that these tasks differentially activate virtually identical systems.

pmid_20566491,Goal representations and motivational drive in schizophrenia: the role of prefrontal-striatal interactions.,,"The past several years have seen a resurgence of interest in understanding the psychological and neural bases of what are often referred to as ""negative symptoms"" in schizophrenia. These aspects of schizophrenia include constructs such as asociality, avolition (a reduction in the motivation to initiate or persist in goal-directed behavior), and anhedonia (a reduction in the ability to experience pleasure). We believe that these dimensions of impairment in individuals with schizophrenia reflect difficulties using internal representations of emotional experiences, previous rewards, and motivational goals to drive current and future behavior in a way that would allow them to obtain desired outcomes, a deficit that has major clinical significance in terms of functional capacity. In this article, we review the major components of the systems that link experienced and anticipated rewards with motivated behavior that could potentially be impaired in schizophrenia. We conclude that the existing evidence suggests relatively intact hedonics in schizophrenia, but impairments in some aspects of reinforcement learning, reward prediction, and prediction error processing, consistent with an impairment in ""wanting."" As of yet, there is only indirect evidence of impairment in anterior cingulate and orbital frontal function that may support value and effort computations. However, there are intriguing hints that individuals with schizophrenia may not be able to use reward information to modulate cognitive control and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex function, suggesting a potentially important role for cortical-striatal interactions in mediating impairment in motivated and goal-directed behavior in schizophrenia.

pmid_22075069,Integration of structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as a system failure is a concept supported by the finding of consistent extramotor as well as motor cerebral pathology. The functional correlates of the structural changes detected using advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging and voxel-based morphometry have not been extensively studied. A group of 25 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was compared to healthy control subjects using a multi-modal neuroimaging approach comprising T(1)-weighted, diffusion-weighted and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Using probabilistic tractography, a grey matter connection network was defined based upon the prominent corticospinal tract and corpus callosum involvement demonstrated by white matter tract-based spatial statistics. This 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-specific' network included motor, premotor and supplementary motor cortices, pars opercularis and motor-related thalamic nuclei. A novel analysis protocol, using this disease-specific grey matter network as an input for a dual-regression analysis, was then used to assess changes in functional connectivity directly associated with this network. A spatial pattern of increased functional connectivity spanning sensorimotor, premotor, prefrontal and thalamic regions was found. A composite of structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging measures also allowed the qualitative discrimination of patients from controls. An integrated structural and functional connectivity approach therefore identified apparently dichotomous processes characterizing the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cerebral network failure, in which there was increased functional connectivity within regions of decreased structural connectivity. Patients with slower rates of disease progression showed connectivity measures with values closer to healthy controls, raising the possibility that functional connectivity increases might not simply represent a physiological compensation to reduced structural integrity. One alternative possibility is that increased functional connectivity reflects a progressive loss of inhibitory cortical influence as part of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathogenesis, which might then have relevance to future therapeutic strategies.

pmid_17566768,Differential activation of the dorsal striatum by high-calorie visual food stimuli in obese individuals.,,"The neural systems regulating food intake in obese individuals remain poorly understood. Previous studies applied positron emission tomography and manipulated hunger and satiety to investigate differences in appetitive processing between obese and normal-weight individuals. However, it is not known whether manipulation of stimulus value may yield different neural activity in obese as compared to control subjects when intrinsic physiological states are kept constant. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate 13 obese and 13 normal-weight subjects and manipulated food motivation by presenting visual food stimuli differing in their caloric content and energy density. In contrast to controls, obese women selectively activated the dorsal striatum while viewing high-caloric foods. Moreover, in the high-calorie condition body mass index (BMI) predicted activation in the dorsal striatum, anterior insula, claustrum, posterior cingulate, postcentral and lateral orbitofrontal cortex. The results indicate that in obese individuals simple visual stimulation with food stimuli activates regions related to reward anticipation and habit learning (dorsal striatum). Additionally, high-calorie food images yielded BMI-dependent activations in regions associated with taste information processing (anterior insula and lateral orbitofrontal cortex), motivation (orbitofrontal cortex), emotion as well as memory functions (posterior cingulate). Collectively, the results suggest that the observed activation is independent of the physiological states of hunger and satiation, and thus may contribute to pathological overeating and obesity. Some of the observed activations (dorsal striatum, orbitofrontal cortex) are likely to be dopamine-mediated. ",

Sex differences","Although evidence has shown that the prevalence rates of Internet gaming disorder (IGD) differ between males and females, few studies have examined whether such sex differences extend to brain function. This study aimed to explore the sex differences in resting-state cerebral activity alterations in IGD. Thirty male participants with IGD (IGDm), 23 female participants with IGD (IGDf), and 30 male and 22 female age-matched healthy controls (HC) underwent resting-state functional MRI. Maps of the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and functional connectivity (FC) were constructed. A two-factor ANCOVA model was performed, with sex and diagnosis as the between-subject factors. Then, post hoc pair-wise comparisons were performed using two-sample t-tests within the interaction masks. The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11) was used to assess the behavioral inhibition function. We found that the ALFF values in the orbital part of the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG) were lower in IGDm than in HCm, which were negatively correlated with BIS-11 scores. IGDm also demonstrated lower connectivity between the orbital part of the left SFG and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), the right angular gyrus, and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex than HCm. Furthermore, IGDm had lower seed connectivity between the orbital part of the left SFG and the PCC than ICDf. Our findings suggest that (1) the altered ALFF values in the orbital part of the left SFG represent a clinically relevant biomarker for the behavioral inhibition function of IGDm; (2) IGD may interact with sex-specific patterns of FC in male and female subjects.

remitted major depression","Mood disorders are characterized by impaired emotion regulation abilities, reflected in alterations in frontolimbic brain functioning during regulation. However, little is known about differences in brain function when comparing regulatory strategies. Reappraisal and emotional acceptance are effective in downregulating negative affect, and are components of effective depression psychotherapies. Investigating neural mechanisms of reappraisal vs emotional acceptance in remitted major depressive disorder (rMDD) may yield novel mechanistic insights into depression risk and prevention. Thirty-seven individuals (18 rMDD, 19 controls) were assessed during a functional magnetic resonance imaging task requiring reappraisal, emotional acceptance or no explicit regulation while viewing sad images. Lower negative affect was reported following reappraisal than acceptance, and was lower following acceptance than no explicit regulation. In controls, the acceptance > reappraisal contrast revealed greater activation in left insular cortex and right prefrontal gyrus, and less activation in several other prefrontal regions. Compared with controls, the rMDD group had greater paracingulate and right midfrontal gyrus (BA 8) activation during reappraisal relative to acceptance. Compared with reappraisal, acceptance is associated with activation in regions linked to somatic and emotion awareness, although this activation is associated with less reduction in negative affect. Additionally, a history of MDD moderated these effects. ",

fMRI","Mindfulness meditation is a form of attention control training. The training exercises the ability to repeatedly focus attention. We addressed the activation changes related to an 8-weeks mindfulness-oriented focused attention meditation training on an initially naïve subject cohort. Before and after training participants underwent an fMRI experiment, thus, although not strictly a cross over design, they served as their internal own control. During fMRI they exercised focused attention on breathing and body scan as compared to resting. We found increased and decreased activation in different parts of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) by comparing pre- vs. post-mindfulness training (MT) during breathing and body scan meditation exercises that were compared against their own resting state. In the post-MT (vs. pre-MT) meditation increased activation in the right dorsolateral PFC and in the left caudate/anterior insula and decreased activation in the rostral PFC and right parietal area 3b. Thus a brief mindfulness training caused increased activation in areas involved in sustaining and monitoring the focus of attention (dorsolateral PFC), consistent with the aim of mindfulness that is exercising focused attention mechanisms, and in the left caudate/anterior insula involved in attention and corporeal awareness and decreased activation in areas part of the ""default mode"" network and is involved in mentalizing (rostral PFC), consistent with the ability trained by mindfulness of reducing spontaneous mind wandering.

pmid_22560044,Potentiated amygdala response to repeated emotional pictures in borderline personality disorder.,,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by an inability to regulate emotional responses. The amygdala is important in learning about the valence (goodness and badness) of stimuli and functions abnormally in BPD. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was employed in three groups: unmedicated BPD (n = 33) and schizotypal personality disorder (n = 28) participants and healthy control subjects (n = 32) during a task involving an intermixed series of unpleasant, neutral, and pleasant pictures each presented twice within their respective trial block/run. The amygdala was hand-traced on each participant's structural MRI scan and co-registered to their MRI scan. Amygdala responses were examined with a mixed-model multivariate analysis of variance. Compared with both control groups, BPD patients showed greater amygdala activation, particularly to the repeated emotional but not neutral pictures, and a prolonged return to baseline for the overall blood oxygen level-dependent response averaged across all pictures. Despite amygdala overactivation, BPD patients showed blunted self-report ratings of emotional but not neutral pictures. Fewer dissociative symptoms in both patient groups were associated with greater amygdala activation to repeated unpleasant pictures. The increased amygdala response to the repeated emotional pictures observed in BPD was not observed in schizotypal patients, suggesting diagnostic specificity. This BPD-related abnormality is consistent with the well-documented clinical feature of high sensitivity to emotional stimuli with unusually strong and long-lasting reactions. The finding of a mismatch between physiological and self-report measures of emotion reactivity in BPD patients suggests they may benefit from treatments targeting emotion recognition. ",
pmid_22270405,"A voxel-based morphometry study comparing problem gamblers, alcohol abusers, and healthy controls.",,"Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are associated with smaller grey matter volumes in cortical and subcortical brain regions which are related to cognitive impairments often found in these disorders. Similar cognitive impairments have been found in patients suffering from problem gambling behaviour. However, in contrast to AUDs, gambling behaviour does not entail brain exposure to toxic agents. Although there are many clinical, neuropsychological, and neurobiological similarities between PG and substance use disorders it has not yet been established whether pathological gambling, similar to alcohol use disorders, is associated with abnormal regional grey matter volumes. With whole-brain voxel-based morphometry we compared a group of 40 treatment seeking problem gamblers, 36 subjects with an alcohol use disorder, and 54 healthy controls to evaluate potential group differences in regional grey matter volumes, corrected for age, IQ, smoking status, and total intracranial volume (TIV). Significantly smaller grey matter volumes in left superior frontal cortex, left precentral cortex, right insula, right putamen, left thalamus, bilateral superior parietal cortex and right supramarginal cortex were present in subjects with an alcohol use disorder compared to healthy controls and problem gamblers. No significant grey matter volume differences were present between problem gamblers and healthy controls. In conclusion, we replicated previous findings of smaller grey matter volumes in subjects with an alcohol use disorder and found no significant morphological brain abnormalities in problem gamblers.

We used an event-related fMRI design with a visuospatial memory delay, followed by a pro-/anti-reach instruction, a planning delay, and finally a ""go"" instruction for movement. This sequence yielded temporally separable preparatory responses that expanded from modest parieto-frontal activation for visual target memory to broad occipital-parietal-frontal activation during planning and execution. Using the pro/anti instruction to differentiate visual and motor directional selectivity during planning, we found that one occipital area showed contralateral ""visual"" selectivity, whereas a broad constellation of left hemisphere occipital, parietal, and frontal areas showed contralateral ""movement"" selectivity. Temporal analysis of these areas through the entire memory-planning sequence revealed early visual selectivity in most areas, followed by movement selectivity in most areas, with all areas showing a stereotypical visuo-movement transition. Cross-correlation of these spatial parameters through time revealed separate spatiotemporally correlated modules for visual input, motor output, and visuo-movement transformations that spanned occipital, parietal, and frontal cortex. These results demonstrate a highly distributed occipital-parietal-frontal reach network involved in the transformation of retrospective sensory information into prospective movement plans. ",

However, it remains unclear whether these effects persist in adolescents after 28 days of abstinence and, if they do, what Performance x Brain Response interactions occur. Adolescent marijuana users (n=17) and controls (n=17) aged 16-18 years were recruited from local schools. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected after 28 days' monitored abstinence as participants performed a spatial working memory task. Marijuana users show Performance x Brain Response interactions in the bilateral temporal lobes, left anterior cingulate, left parahippocampal gyrus, and right thalamus (clusters >/=1358 microl; p<.05), although groups do not differ on behavioral measures of task performance. Marijuana users show differences in brain response to a spatial working memory task despite adequate performance, suggesting a different approach to the task via altered neural pathways. ",
pmid_10599862,fMRI during word processing in dyslexic and normal reading children.,,"The present study addresses phonological processing in children with developmental dyslexia. Following the hypothesis of a core deficit of assembled phonology in dyslexia a set of hierarchically structured tasks was applied that specifically control for different kinds of phonological coding (assembled versus addressed phonological strategies). Seventeen developmental dyslexics and 17 normal reading children were scanned during four different tasks: (1) passive viewing of letter strings (control condition), (2) passive reading of non-words, (3) passive reading of legal words, and (4) a task requiring phonological transformation. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM96). Comparison of patterns of activation in dyslexic and normal reading children revealed significant differences in Broca's area and the left inferior temporal region for both, non-word reading and the phonological transformation task. The present data provide new evidence for alteration of the phonological system in dyslexic children, and in particular, the system that mediates assembled phonological coding. ",

Participants were then invited to be assessed for Internet addiction 6, 12, and 24 months later (the second, third, and fourth assessments, respectively). Ten junior high schools in southern Taiwan.

These results suggest that attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, hostility, depression, and social phobia should be detected early on and intervention carried out to prevent Internet addiction in adolescents. Also, sex differences in psychiatric comorbidity should be taken into consideration when developing prevention and intervention strategies for Internet addiction. ",

Twenty-two total participants were exposed to a series of losses, small wins, and large wins on a computerized simulated slot machine. Results indicate that the two types of gamblers responded differently to the various game options, and that an apparent ""dose effect"" exists when small and big wins are compared for pathological gamblers. Specifically more neural activation occurred in the dopaminergic pathway under conditions of large wins. These data suggest that a non-drug substance such as gambling may mimic typical drug-dose effects shown in previous literature. Implications for the treatment of pathological gamblers are discussed.

pmid_16687507,Individual differences in reward drive predict neural responses to images of food.,,"A network of interconnected brain regions, including orbitofrontal, ventral striatal, amygdala, and midbrain areas, has been widely implicated in a number of aspects of food reward. However, in humans, sensitivity to reward can vary significantly from one person to the next. Individuals high in this trait experience more frequent and intense food cravings and are more likely to be overweight or develop eating disorders associated with excessive food intake. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we report that individual variation in trait reward sensitivity (as measured by the Behavioral Activation Scale) is highly correlated with activation to images of appetizing foods (e.g., chocolate cake, pizza) in a fronto-striatal-amygdala-midbrain network. Our findings demonstrate that there is considerable personality-linked variability in the neural response to food cues in healthy participants and provide important insight into the neurobiological factors underlying vulnerability to certain eating problems (e.g., hyperphagic obesity).

However, less research has examined whether Prolonged Exposure (PE), a first line exposure-based treatment for PTSD, has the potential to alter resting state neural networks. A total of 24 patients with PTSD and 26 matched trauma-exposed healthy controls (TEHCs) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at baseline. PTSD patients were scanned a second time after completing 10-session PE in which patients narrated a detailed trauma account (imaginal exposure) and confronted trauma reminders (in vivo exposure) to extinguish trauma-related fear responses. TEHC were scanned again following a 10-week waiting period. Seed regions of interest (ROIs) included centromedial amygdala (CMA), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and the hippocampus. Post- versus pretreatment comparisons indicated increased rsFC of the BLA and CMA with the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and hippocampus-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) among patients with PTSD, but not among TEHC participants. Enhanced amygdala and hippocampus rsFC with prefrontal cortical regions following PE could underlie improved capacity for inhibition and re-evaluation of threat, and heightened memory encoding and retrieval ability, respectively. These findings encourage further investigation of this circuitry as a therapeutic target in PTSD. ",
pmid_28717158,Neural processing of biological motion in autism: An investigation of brain activity and effective connectivity.,,"The superior temporal sulcus (STS) forms a key region for social information processing and disruptions of its function have been associated with socio-communicative impairments characteristic of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Task-based fMRI was applied in 15 adults with ASD and 15 matched typical-controls (TC) to explore differences in activity and effective connectivity of STS while discriminating either 'intact' versus 'scrambled' biological motion point light displays (explicit processing) or responding to a color-change while the 'intact' versus 'scrambled' nature of the stimulus was irrelevant for the task (implicit processing). STS responded stronger to 'intact' than 'scrambled' stimuli in both groups, indicating that the basic encoding of 'biological' versus 'non-biological' motion seems to be intact in ASD. Only in the TC-group however, explicit attention to the biological motion content induced an augmentation of STS-activity, which was not observed in the ASD-group. Overall, these findings suggest an inadequacy to recruit STS upon task demand in ASD, rather than a generalized alteration in STS neural processing. The importance of attention orienting for recruiting relevant neural resources was further underlined by the observation that connectivity between STS and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a key region in attention regulation, effectively modulated STS-recruitment in the ASD-group.

pmid_21203474,Age and the neural network of personal familiarity.,,"Accessing information that defines personally familiar context in real-world situations is essential for the social interactions and the independent functioning of an individual. Personal familiarity is associated with the availability of semantic and episodic information as well as the emotional meaningfulness surrounding a stimulus. These features are known to be associated with neural activity in distinct brain regions across different stimulus conditions (e.g., when perceiving faces, voices, places, objects), which may reflect a shared neural basis. Although perceiving context-rich personal familiarity may appear unchanged in aging on the behavioral level, it has not yet been studied whether this can be supported by neuroimaging data. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural network associated with personal familiarity during the perception of personally familiar faces and places. Twelve young and twelve elderly cognitively healthy subjects participated in the study. Both age groups showed a similar activation pattern underlying personal familiarity, predominantly in anterior cingulate and posterior cingulate cortices, irrespective of the stimulus type. The young subjects, but not the elderly subjects demonstrated an additional anterior cingulate deactivation when perceiving unfamiliar stimuli. Although we found evidence for an age-dependent reduction in frontal cortical deactivation, our data show that there is a stimulus-independent neural network associated with personal familiarity of faces and places, which is less susceptible to aging-related changes.

Fifteen frequent poker players, ranging from non-problem to high-problem gambling, and 15 non-gambler controls were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). During IGT deck selection, between-group fMRI analyses showed that frequent poker gamblers exhibited higher ventral-striatal but lower dorsolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal activations as compared with controls. Moreover, using functional connectivity analyses, we observed higher ventral-striatal connectivity in poker players, and in regions involved in attentional/motor control (posterior cingulate), visual (occipital gyrus) and auditory (temporal gyrus) processing. In poker gamblers, scores of problem gambling severity were positively associated with ventral-striatal activations and with the connectivity between the ventral-striatum seed and the occipital fusiform gyrus and the middle temporal gyrus. Present results are consistent with findings from recent brain imaging studies showing that gambling disorder is associated with heightened motivational-reward processes during monetary decision making, which may hamper one's ability to moderate his level of monetary risk taking.

social influence","Informational cascades can occur when rationally acting individuals decide independently of their private information and follow the decisions of preceding decision-makers. In the process of updating beliefs, differences in the weighting of private and publicly available social information may modulate the probability that a cascade starts in a decisive way. By using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined neural activity while participants updated their beliefs based on the decisions of two fictitious stock market traders and their own private information, which led to a final decision of buying one of two stocks. Computational modeling of the behavioral data showed that a majority of participants overweighted private information. Overweighting was negatively correlated with the probability of starting an informational cascade in trials especially prone to conformity. Belief updating by private information was related to activity in the inferior frontal gyrus/anterior insula, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex; the more a participant overweighted private information, the higher the activity in the inferior frontal gyrus/anterior insula and the lower in the parietal-temporal cortex. This study explores the neural correlates of overweighting of private information, which underlies the tendency to start an informational cascade. ",

The objective of the present study was to investigate the abnormal brain activations associated with two ADHD subtypes, predominantly inattentive (ADHD-PI) and combined (ADHD-C) subtypes. Twenty-five adults with ADHD-PI, 25 with ADHD-C, and 30 healthy controls (HC) participated in this study. The brain function of the participants were assessed by using the counting Stroop task inside the scanner and the Conners' Continuous Performance Test (CCPT) outside the scanner. The HC group showed greater activations in the caudate nucleus and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) than the ADHD-PI and ADHD-C groups. The ADHD-PI group showed greater activations in the superior parietal lobule (SPL) than the ADHD-C group. In all participants with ADHD, we found negative correlations of activation in the left caudate and the left IFG with the standard deviation of the reaction time of the CCPT, and negative correlations of activation in the left SPL with the reaction time changes across different inter-stimulus intervals. Our results demonstrated altered brain activity in the frontostriatal networks of adults with ADHD-PI and the fronto-striato-parietal networks of adults with ADHD-C. Abnormalities in the parietal areas may represent the main difference between the ADHD-PI and ADHD-C subtypes. ",

The goal of the present study was to investigate adult age differences in functional neural responses in a naturalistic risk-taking task. Twenty-six young adults and 27 healthy older adults completed the Balloon Analogue Risk Task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Young and older adults showed similar overt risk-taking behavior. Group comparison of neural activity in response to risky vs. control stimuli revealed similar patterns of activation in the bilateral striatum, anterior insula (AI) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Group comparison of parametrically modulated activity in response to continued pumping similarly revealed comparable results for both age groups in the AI and, potentially, the striatum, yet differences emerged for regional activity in the vmPFC. At whole brain level, insular, striatal and vmPFC activation was predictive of behavioral risk taking for young but not older adults. The current results are interpreted and discussed as preserved neural tracking of risk and reward in the AI and striatum, respectively, but altered value coding in the vmPFC in the two age groups. The latter finding points toward older adults exhibiting differential vmPFC-related integration and value coding. Furthermore, neural activation holds differential predictive validity for behavioral risk taking in young and older adults. ",
pmid_20600979,The role of the left anterior temporal lobe in the semantic processing of famous faces.,,"Neuroimaging studies on healthy subjects have reported the involvement of the bilateral anterior temporal lobes (ATL) in recognizing known people. While the role of the right ATL in the semantic processing of known people is accepted, it is still matter of debate whether left ATL is implicated in the name retrieval or in the access to semantic information. In the present fMRI study, we modulated the level of specificity of the semantic categorization task of famous face stimuli in order to map the brain regions involved in the specific semantic processing controlling for automatic name access. Specifically, participants (n = 12, mean age = 23.0+/-1.7 years, F/M = 8/4) were asked to determine whether the stimulus photograph matched with the label of the profession category. Since the same set of stimuli was used for both specific and general conditions, contrasting these two conditions controlled for the activation due to the automatic access to the name of famous persons. Results showed that: 1) the right ATL was activated by a semantic categorization task of famous face stimuli at both general and specific level; 2) while controlling for the activation due to the automatic name retrieval, the left ATL showed increased activation during the specific categorization task; 3) the specificity of the semantic processing increased strength of connections towards the left ATL from the right lateral fusiform gyrus, devoted to the visual processing of faces, and from the right ATL. These findings support the idea of a crucial role of the left anterior temporal lobe in the processing of person-specific semantic information. ",

Thus, placebo treatments that have no intrinsic pharmacological effects may produce analgesia by altering expectations. However, controversy exists regarding whether placebos alter sensory pain transmission, pain affect, or simply produce compliance with the suggestions of investigators. In two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments, we found that placebo analgesia was related to decreased brain activity in pain-sensitive brain regions, including the thalamus, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex, and was associated with increased activity during anticipation of pain in the prefrontal cortex, providing evidence that placebos alter the experience of pain.

For example, tool-use may expand the neural representation of peripersonal space. But how is this initial spatial representation influenced by a lifetime of object-related interactions? To examine this question we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural effects of an individual's hand preferences for acting within peripersonal space. Left- and right-handed participants viewed real-world objects at different locations accessible by either the left hand, right hand, or neither hand. The superior parieto-occipital cortex (SPOC), an area most often implicated in reaching actions, showed enhanced visual responses for objects located within the range of space in which each group typically acts. Specifically, in right-handers, who strongly prefer grasping with the right hand, SPOC showed strongest activation for objects located within the range of space for the right hand only. In contrast, in left-handers, who use their two hands comparably often in visuomotor tasks, SPOC showed strongest activation for objects located within the range of space of either hand. These findings show that, even in the absence of overt responses, real 3D objects located in the individual's typical workspace for hand actions automatically invoke enhanced responses in associated visuomotor areas of the brain.

fMRI
reward processing","Internet gaming disorder (IGD) has become a global health problem. The self-regulation model noted that a shift to reward system, whether due to overwhelming reward-seeking or impaired control, can lead to self-regulation failures, e.g., addiction. The present study focused on the reward processing of IGD, aiming to provide insights into the etiology of IGD. Reward processing includes three phases: reward anticipation, outcome monitoring and choice evaluation. However, it is not clear which phases of reward processing are different between individuals with IGD and healthy controls (HC). To address this issue, the present study asked 27 individuals with IGD and 26 HC to complete a roulette task during a functional MRI scan. Compared with HC, individuals with IGD preferred to take risks in pursuit of high rewards behaviorally and showed exaggerated brain activity in the striatum (nucleus accumbens and caudate) during the reward anticipation and outcome monitoring but not during the choice evaluation. These results reveal that the oversensitivity of the reward system to potential and positive rewards in college students with IGD drives them to approach risky options more frequently although they are able to assess the risk values of options and the correctness of decisions properly as HC do. These findings provide partial support for the application of the self-regulation model to the IGD population. Moreover, this study enriches this model from the perspective of three phases of reward processing and provides specific targets for future research regarding effective treatment of IGD. ",
pmid_20167415,Common neural systems associated with the recognition of famous faces and names: an event-related fMRI study.,,"Person recognition can be accomplished through several modalities (face, name, voice). Lesion, neurophysiology and neuroimaging studies have been conducted in an attempt to determine the similarities and differences in the neural networks associated with person identity via different modality inputs. The current study used event-related functional-MRI in 17 healthy participants to directly compare activation in response to randomly presented famous and non-famous names and faces (25 stimuli in each of the four categories). Findings indicated distinct areas of activation that differed for faces and names in regions typically associated with pre-semantic perceptual processes. In contrast, overlapping brain regions were activated in areas associated with the retrieval of biographical knowledge and associated social affective features. Specifically, activation for famous faces was primarily right lateralized and famous names were left-lateralized. However, for both stimuli, similar areas of bilateral activity were observed in the early phases of perceptual processing. Activation for fame, irrespective of stimulus modality, activated an extensive left hemisphere network, with bilateral activity observed in the hippocampi, posterior cingulate, and middle temporal gyri. Findings are discussed within the framework of recent proposals concerning the neural network of person identification. ",

Supervised principal component regression
fMRI","Schizophrenia is considered a disorder of abnormal brain connectivity. Although whole brain maps of averaged bivariate voxel correlations have been successfully applied to study connectivity abnormalities in schizophrenia these maps do not adequately explore the multivariate nature of brain connectivity. Here we adapt a novel method for high-dimensional regression (supervised principal component regression) to estimate brain maps of multivariate non redundant connectivity (NRC) from resting functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data of 116 patients with schizophrenia and 122 matched controls. Disorder related differences in NRC involved caudate hyper-connectivity and hypo-connectivity of several cortical areas such as the dorsal cingulate, the cuneus and the right postcentral cortex. These abnormalities were coupled with abnormalities in the amplitude of signal fluctuations and, to a minor extent, with differences in the dimensionality of connectivity patterns as quantified by the number of supervised principal components. Second level seed correlation analyses linked the observed abnormalities to an additional set of brain regions relevant to schizophrenia such as the thalamus and the temporal cortex. The non redundant connectivity maps proposed here are a new tool that will complement the information provided by other already available voxel based whole brain connectivity measures. ",

Non-traumatic headache","Headache is one of the most common reason for medical consultation to emergency department (ED). The inappropriate use of ED for non-emergency conditions is a problem in terms of overcrowding of emergency facilities, unnecessary testing and treatment, increased medical costs, burden on medical service providers and weaker relationships between patient and primary care provider. The aim of this study was to analyze the different stages of ED management of headache to identify those deficiencies that can be overcome by a fast referral to a headache clinic. The study is a retrospective analysis of the electronic medical records of patients discharged from an academic ED between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2018 and referred to the tertiary level headache centre of the same hospital. We analyzed all aspects related to the permanence in ED and also assessed whether there was a match between the diagnosis made in ED and ours. Among our sample of 244 patients, 76.2% were admitted as ""green tag"", 75% underwent a head computed tomography, 19.3% received a neurological consultation, 43% did not receive any pharmacological treatment and 62.7% still had headache at discharge. The length of stay in ED was associated with reporting the first aura ever (p = 0.014) and whether patients received consultations (p < 0.001). The concordance analysis shown a significant moderate agreement only for the diagnosis of migraine and only between triage and headache centre. Most patients who went to ED complaining of headache received the same treatment regardless of their diagnosis and in many cases the headache had not yet resolved at the time of discharge. Given the many shortcomings in headache management in ED, rapid referral to the headache centre is of paramount importance to help the patient achieve a definiteve diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

pmid_21864197,Risky decision-making in older adults without cognitive deficits: an fMRI study of VMPFC using the Iowa Gambling Task.,,"Some older adults without neurological disease exhibit impaired decision-making in risky, nontransparent situations, like the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). The prefrontal cortices are particularly vulnerable to age-related decline, and numerous studies implicate the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) in successful IGT performance. However, the relationship between IGT performance and VMPFC function in older adults has not yet been tested by fMRI. In the present study, older adults with seemingly no cognitive impairments performed the IGT and a non-gambling control task during fMRI. Group analyses indicate that in these older adults, regardless of IGT performance level, a right VMPFC subregion is activated during the IGT, while successful IGT performance is correlated with left VMPFC activation, suggesting that bilateral VMPFC during risky, nontransparent situations may contribute to successful decision-making in older adults. Individual subject analyses reveal substantial variation regarding the extent and location of VMPFC activation during the IGT, a finding not captured in the group analysis: There is no correlation between IGT performance and extent of activation in the right VMPFC, although there is such a correlation between left VMPFC activation and IGT performance.

pmid_10906316,Segregating semantic and syntactic aspects of processing in the human brain: an fMRI investigation of different word types.,,"The processing of single words that varied in their semantic (concrete/abstract word) and syntactic (content/function word) status was investigated under different task demands (semantic/ syntactic task) in an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment. Task demands to a large degree determined which subparts of the neuronal network supporting word processing were activated. Semantic task demands selectively activated the left pars triangularis of the inferior frontal gyrus (BA 45) and the posterior part of the left middle/superior temporal gyrus (BA 21/22/37). In contrast, syntactic processing requirements led to an increased activation in the inferior tip of the left frontal operculum (BA 44) and the cortex lining the junction of the inferior frontal and inferior precentral sulcus (BA 44/6). Moreover, for these latter areas a word class by concreteness interaction was observed when a syntactic judgement was required. This interaction can be interpreted as a prototypicality effect: non-prototypical members of a word class, i.e. concrete function words and abstract content words, showed a larger activation than prototypical members, i.e. abstract function words and concrete content words. The combined data suggest that the activation pattern underlying word processing is predicted neither by syntactic class nor semantic concreteness but, rather, by task demands focusing either on semantic or syntactic aspects. Thus, our findings that semantic and syntactic aspects of processing are both functionally distinct and involve different subparts of the neuronal network underlying word processing support a domain-specific organization of the language system.

Although T2DM is primarily a peripheral disorder and AD is a central nervous system disease, both share some common features as they are chronic and complex diseases, and both show involvement of oxidative stress and inflammation in their progression. These characteristics suggest that T2DM may be associated with AD, which gave rise to a new term, type 3 diabetes (T3DM). In this study, we searched for matching peripheral proteomic biomarkers of AD and T2DM based in a systematic review of the available literature. We identified 17 common biomarkers that were differentially expressed in both patients with AD or T2DM when compared with healthy controls. These biomarkers could provide a useful workflow for screening T2DM patients at risk to develop AD. ",

Cerebellar presence in a wide range of cognitive functions examined within an increasing body of neuroimaging literature has been observed. We applied a meta-analytic approach, which employed the activation likelihood estimate method, to consolidate results of cerebellar involvement accumulated in different cognitive tasks of interest and systematically identified similarities among the studies. The current analysis included 88 neuroimaging studies demonstrating cerebellar activations in higher cognitive domains involving emotion, executive function, language, music, timing and working memory. While largely consistent with a prior meta-analysis by Stoodley and Schmahmann ([2009]: Neuroimage 44:489-501), our results extended their findings to include music and timing domains to provide further insights into cerebellar involvement and elucidate its role in higher cognition. In addition, we conducted inter- and intradomain comparisons for the cognitive domains of emotion, language, and working memory. We also considered task differences within the domain of verbal working memory by conducting a comparison of the Sternberg with the n-back task, as well as an analysis of the differential components within the Sternberg task. Results showed a consistent cerebellar presence in the timing domain, providing evidence for a role in time keeping. Unique clusters identified within the domain further refine the topographic organization of the cerebellum. ",
pmid_20463204,Choosing to make an effort: the role of striatum in signaling physical effort of a chosen action.,,"The possibility that we will have to invest effort influences our future choice behavior. Indeed deciding whether an action is actually worth taking is a key element in the expression of human apathy or inertia. There is a well developed literature on brain activity related to the anticipation of effort, but how effort affects actual choice is less well understood. Furthermore, prior work is largely restricted to mental as opposed to physical effort or has confounded temporal with effortful costs. Here we investigated choice behavior and brain activity, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, in a study where healthy participants are required to make decisions between effortful gripping, where the factors of force (high and low) and reward (high and low) were varied, and a choice of merely holding a grip device for minimal monetary reward. Behaviorally, we show that force level influences the likelihood of choosing an effortful grip. We observed greater activity in the putamen when participants opt to grip an option with low effort compared with when they opt to grip an option with high effort. The results suggest that, over and above a nonspecific role in movement anticipation and salience, the putamen plays a crucial role in computations for choice that involves effort costs. ",
pmid_18420426,Generation of novel motor sequences: the neural correlates of musical improvisation.,,"While some motor behavior is instinctive and stereotyped or learned and re-executed, much action is a spontaneous response to a novel set of environmental conditions. The neural correlates of both pre-learned and cued motor sequences have been previously studied, but novel motor behavior has thus far not been examined through brain imaging. In this paper, we report a study of musical improvisation in trained pianists with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), using improvisation as a case study of novel action generation. We demonstrate that both rhythmic (temporal) and melodic (ordinal) motor sequence creation modulate activity in a network of brain regions comprised of the dorsal premotor cortex, the rostral cingulate zone of the anterior cingulate cortex, and the inferior frontal gyrus. These findings are consistent with a role for the dorsal premotor cortex in movement coordination, the rostral cingulate zone in voluntary selection, and the inferior frontal gyrus in sequence generation. Thus, the invention of novel motor sequences in musical improvisation recruits a network of brain regions coordinated to generate possible sequences, select among them, and execute the decided-upon sequence.

pmid_15955481,Functional MRI of galvanic vestibular stimulation with alternating currents at different frequencies.,,"Functional MRI was performed in 28 healthy volunteers to study the effects of galvanic vestibular stimulation with alternating currents (AC-GVS) of different frequencies on brain activation patterns. The aims of this study were (1) to identify specific areas within the vestibular cortical network that are involved in the processing of frequency-specific aspects by correlation analyses, (2) to determine the optimal frequency for stimulation of the vestibular system with respect to perception, and (3) to analyze whether different frequencies of AC-GVS are mediated in different cortical areas or different sites within the vestibular cortex. AC-GVS was performed using sinusoidal stimulation currents with an amplitude of +/-2.5 mA, and frequencies of 0.1 Hz, 0.3 Hz, 0.8 Hz, 1.0 Hz, 2.0 Hz, and 5.0 Hz were applied. Regardless of the applied stimulation frequency, AC-GVS elicited activations within a network of multisensory areas similar to those described in earlier studies using direct currents. No mapping of different stimulation frequencies to different cortical locations was observed. Additional activations of somatosensory cortex areas were observed during stimulation with 5 Hz only. The strongest vestibular sensations were reported during stimulation with 1 Hz and 2 Hz. Correlation analyses between blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal changes and stimulation frequency revealed a positive dependency in areas of the supramarginal gyrus, posterolateral thalamus, cerebellar vermis, posterior insula, and in the hippocampal region/uncus. These regions represent areas involved in the processing of vestibular information for head and body orientation in space. ",

neuroimaging","Alexithymia is a psychological construct that can be divided into a cognitive and affective dimension. The cognitive dimension is characterized by difficulties in identifying, verbalizing and analysing feelings. The affective dimension comprises reduced levels of emotional experience and imagination. Alexithymia is widely regarded to arise from an impairment of emotion regulation. This is the first functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to critically evaluate this by investigating the neural correlates of emotion regulation as a function of alexithymia levels. The aim of the current study was to investigate the neural correlates underlying the two alexithymia dimensions during emotion perception and emotion regulation. Using fMRI, we scanned 51 healthy subjects while viewing, reappraising or suppressing negative emotional pictures. The results support the idea that cognitive alexithymia, but not affective alexithymia, is associated with lower activation in emotional attention and recognition networks during emotion perception. However, in contrast with several theories, no alexithymia-related differences were found during emotion regulation (neither reappraisal nor suppression). These findings suggest that alexithymia may result from an early emotion processing deficit rather than compromised frontal circuits subserving higher-order emotion regulation processes. ",
pmid_21584904,"The hippocampus is involved in mental navigation for a recently learned, but not a highly familiar environment: a longitudinal fMRI study.",,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to investigate the hypothesis that memory for a large-scale environment is initially dependent on the hippocampus but is later supported by extra-hippocampal structures (e.g., precuneus, posterior parahippocampal cortex, and lingual gyrus) once the environment is well-learned. Participants were scanned during mental navigation tasks initially when they were newly arrived to the city of Toronto, and later after having lived and navigated within the city for 1 yr. In the first session, activation was observed in the right hippocampus, left precuneus, and postcentral gyrus. The second session revealed activation in the caudate and lateral temporal cortex, but not in the right hippocampus; additional activation was instead observed in the posterior parahippocampal cortex, lingual gyrus, and precuneus. These findings suggest that the right hippocampus is required for the acquisition of new spatial information but is not needed to represent this information when the environment is highly familiar.

pmid_19732838,The multifaceted nature of the relationship between performance and brain activity in motor sequence learning.,,"The 'learning and performance' conundrum has for a long time puzzled the field of cognitive neuroscience. Deciphering the genuine functional neuroanatomy of motor sequence learning, among that of other skills, has thereby been hampered. The main caveat is that changes in neural activity that inherently accompany task practice may not only reflect the learning process per se, but also the basic motor implementation of improved performance. Previous research has attempted to control for a performance confound in brain activity by adopting methodologies that prevent changes in performance. However, blocking the expression of performance is likely to distort the very nature of the motor sequence learning process, and may thus represent a major confound in itself. In the present study, we postulated that both learning-dependent plasticity mechanisms and learning-independent implementation processes are nested within the relationship that exists between performance and brain activity. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to map brain responses in healthy volunteers while they either (a) learned a novel sequence, (b) produced a highly automatized sequence or (c) executed non-sequential movements matched for speed frequency. In order to dissociate between qualitatively distinct, but intertwined, relationships between performance and neural activity, our analyses focused on correlations between variations in performance and brain activity, and how this relationship differs or shares commonalities between conditions. Results revealed that activity in the putamen and contralateral lobule VI of the cerebellum most strongly correlated with performance during learning per se, suggesting their key role in this process. By contrast, activity in a parallel cerebellar network, as well as in motor and premotor cortical areas, was modulated by performance during learning and during one or both control condition(s), suggesting the primary contribution of these areas in motor implementation, either as a function or not of the sequential content of movements. Our findings thus highlight the multifaceted nature of the link between performance and brain activity, and suggest that different components of the striato-cortical and cerebello-cortical motor loops play distinct, but complementary, roles during early motor sequence learning.

The comparison between conflict problems in the second scan versus in the first scan revealed differing activation for the left inferior frontal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, cerebellum, and precuneus. The scan was time locked to the presentation of the minor premise, and thus demonstrated effects of belief-logic conflict on neural activation earlier in the time course than has previously been shown in fMRI. These data, moreover, indicated that logical training results in changes in brain activity associated with cognitive control processing. ",

neuropsychology","The developmental taxonomic theory proposes that there are two subtypes of antisocial behaviour. The first is a neurodevelopmental disorder which emerges in early childhood and follows a life-course persistent course, whereas the second emerges in adolescence, remits in early adulthood and reflects peer processes such as mimicry of antisocial peers. The aim of this review was to evaluate the developmental taxonomic theory in the light of recent empirical research. We conducted a comprehensive literature review comparing these subtypes of antisocial behaviour based on searches on PubMed and other scientific databases covering the period from 1993 to 2013. We focused on research encompassing psychiatric epidemiology, personality assessment, neuropsychology, neuroendocrinology, genetics, and structural and functional neuroimaging. Sixty one empirical studies were identified that investigated one of these forms of antisocial behaviour separately or explicitly compared childhood-onset and adolescence-onset forms of antisocial behaviour. Empirical research provides support for the hypothesis that life-course persistent antisocial behaviour is a neurodevelopmental disorder which emerges in the transactions between individual vulnerabilities and environmental adversity. In contrast to the developmental taxonomic theory, however, empirical findings suggest that severe antisocial behaviour that emerges in adolescence frequently has a negative prognosis and is rarely limited to the adolescent period. In addition, both forms of antisocial behaviour are associated with emotion processing deficits, changes in brain structure and function, alterations in cortisol secretion, and atypical personality traits (such as increased callous-unemotional traits). We conclude that the developmental taxonomic theory is in need of revision, as differences between life-course persistent and adolescence-onset forms of antisocial behaviour appear to be quantitative, rather than qualitative, in nature. In addition, evidence is accumulating that adolescence-onset antisocial behaviour may also be a neurodevelopmental disorder. To account for the similarities between these groups, despite the differences in their age-of-onset, we propose that the quality of the child's early environment moderates the relationship between individual vulnerabilities and the age-of-onset of antisocial behaviour.

Some findings in human and animal models have linked T2DM to AD-type dementia. Despite epidemiological associations between the T2DM and cognitive impairment, the interrelational mechanisms are unclear. The preponderance of evidence in longitudinal studies with autopsy confirmation have indicated that vascular mechanisms, rather than classic AD-type pathologies, underlie the cognitive decline often seen in self-reported T2DM. T2DM is associated with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease (CVD), and is associated with increased risk of infarcts and small vessel disease in the brain and other organs. Neuropathological examinations of post-mortem brains demonstrated evidence of cerebrovascular disease and little to no correlation between T2DM and β-amyloid deposits or neurofibrillary tangles. Nevertheless, the mechanisms upstream of early AD-specific pathology remain obscure. In this regard, there may indeed be overlap between the pathologic mechanisms of T2DM/""metabolic syndrome,"" and AD. More specifically, cerebral insulin processing, glucose metabolism, mitochondrial function, and/or lipid metabolism could be altered in patients in early AD and directly influence symptomatology and/or neuropathology.

pmid_19879365,Neural mechanisms of the influence of popularity on adolescent ratings of music.,,"It is well-known that social influences affect consumption decisions. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to elucidate the neural mechanisms associated with social influence with regard to a common consumer good: music. Our study population was adolescents, age 12-17. Music is a common purchase in this age group, and it is widely believed that adolescent behavior is influenced by perceptions of popularity in their reference group. Using 15-s clips of songs from MySpace.com, we obtained behavioral measures of preferences and neurobiological responses to the songs. The data were gathered with, and without, the overall popularity of the song revealed. Song popularity had a significant effect on the participants' likability ratings of the songs. fMRI results showed a strong correlation between the participants' rating and activity in the caudate nucleus, a region previously implicated in reward-driven actions. The tendency to change one's evaluation of a song was positively correlated with activation in the anterior insula and anterior cingulate, two regions that are associated with physiological arousal and negative affective states. Sensitivity to popularity was linked to lower activation levels in the middle temporal gyrus, suggesting a lower depth of musical semantic processing. Our results suggest that a principal mechanism whereby popularity ratings affect consumer choice is through the anxiety generated by the mismatch between one's own preferences and others'. This mismatch anxiety motivates people to switch their choices in the direction of the consensus. Our data suggest that this is a major force behind the conformity observed in music tastes in some teenagers. ",

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) studies in children suggest that ADHD is associated with structural abnormalities in the brain. However, very little research has been carried out on adult ADHD. Using high-resolution MRI, we tested the hypothesis that adult ADHD patients exhibit gray and/or white matter volume (GMV, WMV) abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), cingulate cortex (CC), hippocampus and amygdala, also evaluating putative associations between volumetric data and symptoms of ADHD. We investigated 20 adult patients with ADHD and 20 age-matched healthy controls. We found significantly smaller GMV in the right and left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) but no GMV/WMV difference in the PFC, hippocampus and amygdala. No correlation was found between ADHD behavioral measures and MRI data. Our results might suggest that adults with ADHD exhibit smaller GMV in the ACC, as measured by VBM. Volumetric abnormalities in the brain of adult ADHD patients might be less pronounced than those found in children and adolescents, although the role played by chronic stimulant treatment needs further investigation.

However, the basic neural mechanisms by which mindfulness operates and relates to everyday outcomes in novices remain unexplored. Focused attention is a common mindfulness induction where practitioners focus on specific physical sensations, typically the breath. The present study explores the neural mechanisms of this common mindfulness induction among novice practitioners. Healthy novice participants completed a brief task with both mindful attention [focused breathing (FB)] and control (unfocused attention) conditions during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Relative to the control condition, FB recruited an attention network including parietal and prefrontal structures and trait-level mindfulness during this comparison also correlated with parietal activation. Results suggest that the neural mechanisms of a brief mindfulness induction are related to attention processes in novices and that trait mindfulness positively moderates this activation. ",
pmid_24902936,Neural circuits of emotion regulation: a comparison of mindfulness-based and cognitive reappraisal strategies.,,"Dealing with one's emotions is a core skill in everyday life. Effective cognitive control strategies have been shown to be neurobiologically represented in prefrontal structures regulating limbic regions. In addition to cognitive strategies, mindfulness-associated methods are increasingly applied in psychotherapy. We compared the neurobiological mechanisms of these two strategies, i.e. cognitive reappraisal and mindfulness, during both the cued expectation and perception of negative and potentially negative emotional pictures. Fifty-three healthy participants were examined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (47 participants included in analysis). Twenty-four subjects applied mindfulness, 23 used cognitive reappraisal. On the neurofunctional level, both strategies were associated with comparable activity of the medial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala. When expecting negative versus neutral stimuli, the mindfulness group showed stronger activations in ventro- and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, supramarginal gyrus as well as in the left insula. During the perception of negative versus neutral stimuli, the two groups only differed in an increased activity in the caudate in the cognitive group. Altogether, both strategies recruited overlapping brain regions known to be involved in emotion regulation. This result suggests that common neural circuits are involved in the emotion regulation by mindfulness-based and cognitive reappraisal strategies. Identifying differential activations being associated with the two strategies in this study might be one step towards a better understanding of differential mechanisms of change underlying frequently used psychotherapeutic interventions.

Previous studies have confirmed the schizophrenia-related functional connectivity between the striatal and cortical regions. However, among these, few studies have attempted to determine the directional flow of the influence. In the present study, we used resting-state fMRI to explore the directed connectivity between the striatum and the cortical regions in schizophrenia. Employing a Granger causality analysis, we observed a significant failure of the directed inhibitory influence of the striatum on the default mode network (DMN) in schizophrenia. Furthermore, the reciprocal influence of the DMN on the striatum was also significantly reduced. These findings provide compelling evidence for a breakdown of the striatum-DMN loop in schizophrenia. This abnormal connectivity could be related to clinical variables. In conclusion, our study suggests that abnormally directed influences between the striatum and the DMN might be a biomarker of schizophrenia and also reveals a potential target for treatment. ",

biological motion
social cognition","It has been hypothesized that individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (hereafter ""autism"") have problems perceiving biological motion, which contributes to their social difficulties. However, the ability to perceive the kinematic profile characteristic of biological motion has not been systematically examined in autism. To examine this basic perceptual ability we conducted two experiments comparing adults with autism with matched typical adults. In Experiment 1, participants indicated whether two movements-which differed in the quantity of formula-generated biological motion-were the same or different. In Experiment 2, they judged which of two movements was ""less natural,"" where the stimuli varied in the degree to which they were a product of real movement data produced by autistic and typical models. There were no group differences in perceptual sensitivity in either experiment, with null effects supported by Bayesian analyses. The findings from these two experiments demonstrate that adults with autism are sensitive to the kinematic information defining biological motion to a typical degree-they are both able to detect the perceptual information in a same-different judgment, and as inclined to categorize biological motion derived from real models as natural. These findings therefore provide evidence against the hypothesis that individuals with autism exhibit low-level difficulties in perceiving the kinematics of others' actions, suggesting that atypicalities arise either when integrating this kinematic information with other perceptual input, or in the interpretation of kinematic information. Autism Res 2019, 12: 284-294 © 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: It has previously been suggested that autistic children and adults have problems perceiving the detailed manner in which others move-that is, the subtle changes in speed as we move from point to point-which may impact on their ability to learn from, and about, others in a typical fashion. However, the results from the present two studies demonstrate that adults with autism can perceive this information, suggesting that atypicalities in processing others' movement may arise mainly as a consequence of atypical interpretation rather than perception.

We found different patterns of activation depending on the type of noun and the type of feature contributing to the noun. Complex nouns recruited significantly greater bilateral superior temporal and left prefrontal activation compared to nominal kind nouns, while nominal kind nouns activated bilateral medial parietal and right inferior parietal regions more than complex nouns. Moreover, features making a statistically high contribution to complex noun meaning activated right inferior frontal cortex relative to low-contribution features, while diagnostic features of nominal kinds activated left dorsolateral prefrontal and right parietal regions more than characteristic features. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that at least two different neural mechanisms appear to support word meaning: one driven by a statistically determined approach to feature knowledge, and the other sensitive to the qualitatively critical role that a specific diagnostic feature plays in word meaning.

pmid_14594746,An FMRI Stroop task study of ventromedial prefrontal cortical function in pathological gamblers.,,"Function of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex has been implicated in impulse control. The authors used the Stroop paradigm to test attention and response inhibition during the presentation of congruent and incongruent stimuli in male pathological gamblers and a group of comparison subjects. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine ventromedial prefrontal cortex function during Stroop performance. In response to infrequent incongruent stimuli, pathological gamblers demonstrated decreased activity in the left ventromedial prefrontal cortex relative to the comparison subjects. Both groups demonstrated similar activity changes in multiple brain regions, including activation of the dorsal anterior cingulate and dorsolateral frontal cortex. Pathological gamblers share many neural correlates of Stroop task performance with healthy subjects but differ in a brain region previously implicated in disorders characterized by poor impulse control.

pmid_16237317,Subgenual anterior cingulate activation to valenced emotional stimuli in major depression.,,"Major depression has been associated with anomalous activation in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, but its response to emotional stimuli is poorly understood. The primary goal of this study was to compare levels of activation in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex of diagnosed depressed and nondepressed participants in response to happy and sad facial expressions of affect. Whereas cognitive theories of depression predict increased activation to negative stimuli, depressed participants were found to exhibit increased activation to both types of stimuli in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. Importantly, the loci were in different regions of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, suggesting that there is functional specialization in the processing of negatively and positively valenced stimuli.

pmid_21332594,Evaluation of working memory impairment in children with primary nocturnal enuresis: evidence from event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging.,,"To assess the working memory and explore the differential activations of brain areas in children with primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE) by performing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans using the categorical N-Back task.   Thirteen right-handed PNE children (M/F = 7:6, average age 11.4 ± 0.8 years) and 15 age-matched, right-handed, healthy controls (M/F = 9:6, 11.3 ± 1.0 years) were recruited for the study. First, intelligence tests were performed using Chinese Wechsler Young Children Scales of Intelligence in PNE children and controls. The full intelligence quotient (FIQ), verbal IQ (VIQ), performance IQ (PIQ) and memory/caution (M/C) factor were measured. After intelligence tests, event-related fMRI scans were performed using the categorical N-Back working memory task on a 3.0T MR scanner. The percent of correct responses (PCR) and the mean reaction time to correct response (mRT) were recorded and compared; fMRI data were analysed using SPM2, the differences in activation were compared with the single subject and between-group levels. The FIQ, VIQ and PIQ in the PNE group were within the normal range and did not significantly differ from the control group (P > 0.05). The M/C factor was statistically significantly lower in the PNE group (P < 0.05). In the N-Back test, PNE children had lower PCR and longer mRT than controls (P < 0.05). A between-group analysis of fMRI data revealed significant attenuation in the left posterior cerebellar lobes of PNE children. PNE children had deficits in working memory, and dysfunction in the left cerebella might be associated with their working memory deficits. ",
pmid_22564480,Creativity and the brain: uncovering the neural signature of conceptual expansion.,,"Neurophysiological studies of creativity thus far have not allowed for clear conclusions to be made regarding the specific neural underpinnings of such complex cognition due to overgeneralizations concerning the creativity construct, heterogeneity in the type of creativity tasks used, and the questionable efficacy of the employed comparison tasks. A novel experimental design was developed in the present fMRI study which rendered it possible to investigate a critical facet of creative cognition - that of conceptual expansion - as distinct from general divergent thinking, working memory, or cognitive load. Brain regions involved in the retention, retrieval and integration of conceptual knowledge such as the anterior inferior frontal gyrus, the temporal poles and the lateral frontopolar cortex were found to be selectively involved during conceptual expansion. The findings go against generic ideas that argue for the dominance of the right hemisphere during creative thinking and indicate the necessity to reconsider the functions of regions such as the anterior cingulate cortex to include more abstract facets of cognitive control. This study represents a new direction in the investigation of creativity in that it highlights the necessity to adopt a process based perspective in which the multifaceted nature of creativity can be truly grasped.

pmid_10581226,The neural correlates of verb and noun processing. A PET study.,,"The hypothesis that categorical information, distinguishing among word classes, such as nouns, verbs, etc., is an organizational principle of lexical knowledge in the brain, is supported by the observation of aphasic subjects who are selectively impaired in the processing of nouns and verbs. The study of lesion location in these patients has suggested that the left temporal lobe plays a crucial role in processing nouns, while the left frontal lobe is necessary for verbs. To delineate the brain areas involved in the processing of different word classes, we used PET to measure regional cerebral activity during tasks requiring reading of concrete and abstract nouns and verbs for lexical decision. These tasks activated an extensive network of brain areas, mostly in the left frontal and temporal cortex, which represents the neural correlate of single word processing. Some left hemispheric areas, including the dorsolateral frontal and lateral temporal cortex, were activated only by verbs, while there were no brain areas more active in response to nouns. Furthermore, the comparison of abstract and concrete words indicated that abstract word processing was associated with selective activations (right temporal pole and amygdala, bilateral inferior frontal cortex), while no brain areas were more active in response to concrete words. There were no significant interaction effects between word class and concreteness. Taken together, these findings are compatible with the view that lexical-semantic processing of words is mediated by an extensive, predominantly left hemispheric network of brain structures. Additional brain activations appear to be related to specific semantic content, or, in the case of verbs, may be associated with the automatic access of syntactic information. ",
pmid_24838536,The association between TOMM40 gene polymorphism and spontaneous brain activity in amnestic mild cognitive impairment.,,"The outer mitochondria membrane 40 homolog (TOMM40) is thought to be involved in the mitochondrial function and to influence the susceptibility for the development of AD. To determine whether TOMM40 rs157581 polymorphism is a plausible modulator of spontaneous brain activity in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients, 46 aMCI subjects and 21 healthy controls were recruited and explored. Each individual was firstly genotyped for TOMM40 rs157581 and was further assessed by resting-state functional MRI to evaluate regional brain activity using amplitude low-frequency fluctuation analysis (ALFF). aMCI patients showed decreased ALFF in the left inferior frontal gyrus and insula, and increased ALFF in right posterior cingulate, lingual gyrus and calcarine sulcus. A significant difference in the interaction of ""groups × genotypes"" was observed in the bilateral superior frontal gyrus, bilateral lingual gyrus, right calcarine sulcus and left cerebellum. These results demonstrated a pattern of change in ALFF values, in which increased and subsequently decreased ALFF values in parallel with the progression of aMCI symptoms. The present study shows for the first time that TOMM40 rs157581 polymorphism may modulate regional spontaneous brain activity and related to the progression of aMCI. ",
pmid_10458945,A developmental functional MRI study of spatial working memory.,,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine patterns of cortical activity in children during performance of a spatial working memory task. Six children (8-10 years) and six adults (19-26 years) searched a linear array of four boxes for the appearance of a dot. In the visual blocks, participants made no response. In the motor blocks, participants were instructed to indicate the location of the dot on each trial using a button-press response. In the working memory blocks, participants were instructed to indicate at which location the dot had appeared 1 or 2 trials previously. Both children and adults showed activity in the left precentral and postcentral gyri, as well as the right cerebellum for the motor condition as compared to the visual condition. Comparison of the memory and motor conditions revealed reliable activity in the right superior frontal gyrus (BA 8), right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 10/46), right superior parietal cortex, and bilateral inferior parietal cortex for both adults and children. These results suggest that spatial working memory tasks activate very similar cortical regions for school-age children and adults. The findings differ from previous imaging studies of nonspatial working memory tasks in that the prefrontal activations observed in the current work tend to be more dorsal. Results are discussed in light of the significant behavioral performance differences observed between child and adult participants. ",
pmid_8736560,Location and function of the human frontal eye-field: a selective review.,,"The location and possible function of the human frontal eye-field (FEF) were evaluated by reviewing results of cerebral blood-flow (CBF) and lesion studies. A remarkable consistency was found regarding the rostro-caudal (Y: from -6 to 1 mm) and dorso-ventral (Z: from 44 to 51 mm) location of the FEF, as defined by the CBF method within a standardized stereotaxic system (the zero point for all X, Y and Z coordinates coinciding with the anterior commissure, Talairach and Tournoux [Co-planar Stereotactic Atlas of the Human Brain, Georg Thieme, Stuttgart, 1988]. In contrast, there was a marked variability along the mediolateral axis (X: from -24 to -40 mm for the left hemisphere and from 21 to 40 mm for the right hemisphere). The human FEF is thus located either in the vicinity of the precentral sulcus and/or in the depth of the caudalmost part of the superior frontal sulcus. In either case, this location challenges the commonly held view of the FEF being located in Broadmann's area 8. With regard to FEF function, the results of CBF studies failed to support a role for the FEF in the cognitive aspects of oculomotor control, such as the execution of anti-saccades. Blood-flow activation data are consistent in this respect with the results of lesion studies. It is proposed that future research on FEF function in human subjects may benefit from focusing on the visuomotor rather than the cognitive aspects of oculomotor control. ",

Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
Resting-state fMRI",Evidence points to a crucial role for altered neural oscillations and synchrony in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Previous resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies found aberrant amplitudes of low-frequency oscillations in adult patients with schizophrenia. Whether the abnormality is also present in adolescents with early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) is largely unknown. We recruited 39 adolescents with a first episode of EOS and 31 age- and education- matched healthy controls. Resting state fMRI was obtained using an echo-planar imaging sequence. Voxel-wise amplitude of low-frequency (0.01-0.08Hz) fluctuations (ALFF) was compared between groups. We investigated seed-based functional connectivity between significantly disturbed ALFF regions and whole brain voxels in all participants. EOS participants exhibited significantly increased ALFF values in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and decreased ALFF in the ventral precuneus compared with controls. Decreased ALFF values in the precuneus of EOS showed a significant negative correlation with negative symptom scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Disturbed functional connectivity mainly occurred between the orbitofrontal cortex and the temporal cortex in EOS. These findings demonstrate abnormal spontaneous neuronal activity and functional connectivity in the frontal and parietal cortex of EOS. Aberrant ALFF in the precuneus might be a biomarker of EOS. ,
pmid_31123150,A scarcity mindset alters neural processing underlying consumer decision making.,"consumer choice
fMRI
scarcity","Not having enough of what one needs has long been shown to have detrimental consequences for decision making. Recent work suggests that the experience of insufficient resources can create a ""scarcity"" mindset; increasing attention toward the scarce resource itself, but at the cost of attention for unrelated aspects. To investigate the effects of a scarcity mindset on consumer choice behavior, as well as its underlying neural mechanisms, we used an experimental manipulation to induce both a scarcity and an abundance mindset within participants and examined the effects of both mindsets on participants' willingness to pay for familiar food items while being scanned using fMRI. Results demonstrated that a scarcity mindset affects neural mechanisms related to consumer decision making. When in a scarcity mindset compared with an abundance mindset, participants had increased activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, a region often implicated in valuation processes. Moreover, again compared with abundance, a scarcity mindset decreased activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, an area well known for its role in goal-directed choice. This effect was predominant in the group of participants who experienced scarcity following abundance, suggesting that the effects of scarcity are largest when they are compared with previous situations when resources were plentiful. More broadly, these data suggest a potential neural locus for a scarcity mindset and demonstrate how these changes in brain activity might underlie goal-directed decision making. ",
pmid_15499576,Effects of electroacupuncture versus manual acupuncture on the human brain as measured by fMRI.,,"The goal of this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was to compare the central effects of electroacupuncture at different frequencies with traditional Chinese manual acupuncture. Although not as time-tested as manual acupuncture, electroacupuncture does have the advantage of setting stimulation frequency and intensity objectively and quantifiably. Manual acupuncture, electroacupuncture at 2 Hz and 100 Hz, and tactile control stimulation were carried out at acupoint ST-36. Overall, electroacupuncture (particularly at low frequency) produced more widespread fMRI signal increase than manual acupuncture did, and all acupuncture stimulations produced more widespread responses than did our placebo-like tactile control stimulation. Acupuncture produced hemodynamic signal increase in the anterior insula, and decrease in limbic and paralimbic structures including the amygdala, anterior hippocampus, and the cortices of the subgenual and retrosplenial cingulate, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, frontal, and temporal poles, results not seen for tactile control stimulation. Only electroacupuncture produced significant signal increase in the anterior middle cingulate cortex, whereas 2-Hz electroacupuncture produced signal increase in the pontine raphe area. All forms of stimulation (acupuncture and control) produced signal increase in SII. These findings support a hypothesis that the limbic system is central to acupuncture effect regardless of specific acupuncture modality, although some differences do exist in the underlying neurobiologic mechanisms for these modalities, and may aid in optimizing their future usage in clinical applications.

pmid_20543183,Neuroimaging of multimodal sensory stimulation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,,"Structural and functional imaging techniques were combined to investigate sensory system function in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Functional MRI (fMRI) was used to investigate cortical activity during visual, auditory and somatosensory stimulation in 14 ALS patients and 18 control subjects. Changes in amplitude, latency and duration of the blood oxygen level dependent response were modelled. Furthermore, diffusion tensor imaging was used to investigate changes in white matter networks. During visual stimulation, fMRI demonstrated a decreased response in secondary visual areas in ALS, possibly related to demyelination of sensory nerve fibres. Increasing brain activity in associative cortices was linked to a decrease in physical functioning and might represent a compensatory process. Additionally, reduced white matter functioning became evident for fibres projecting to the extrastriate visual cortex. For auditory stimulation, a delayed response in secondary auditory areas probably linked to prolonged nerve conductance time and an altered cortical pattern in areas involved in target processing/detection became evident in ALS patients. Structural white matter changes in the primary and secondary auditory cortices were observed. For somatosensory stimulation, a prolonged/reduced response in sensory integration areas of the parietal lobe was observed, perhaps linked to the reduced visceral inflow due to immobility. Multiparametric MRI suggests a progressive functional deficit in secondary/higher order sensory processing areas in ALS, probably associated with reduction of re-afferent information flow due to progressive immobility. The changes described might also represent an expression of the disease process itself. Evidence for compensatory processes in multimodal associative cortices was found. ",

Dual-processing theory suggests that nonanalytic reasoning is an essential aspect of expertise; however, assessing nonanalytic reasoning is challenging because it is believed to occur on the subconscious level. This assumption makes concurrent verbal protocols less reliable assessment tools. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to explore the neural basis of nonanalytic reasoning in internal medicine interns (novices) and board-certified staff internists (experts) while completing United States Medical Licensing Examination and American Board of Internal Medicine multiple-choice questions. The results demonstrated that novices and experts share a common neural network in addition to nonoverlapping neural resources. However, experts manifested greater neural processing efficiency in regions such as the prefrontal cortex during nonanalytical reasoning. These findings reveal a multinetwork system that supports the dual-process mode of expert clinical reasoning during medical evaluation. ",

Thalamus","Adverse childhood experiences (ACE) can lead to several negative consequences in adult life, are highly prevalent in psychiatric disorders where they associate with clinical and brain morphological features. Grey matter volume loss is a central characteristic of bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SCZ). The aim of this study is to measure the effect of diagnosis and ACE on GM volume in a sample of patients with BD or SCZ compared with healthy controls (HC). We studied 206 depressed BD patients, 96 SCZ patients and 136 healthy subjects. GM volumes were estimated with 3.0 Tesla MRI and analyzed with VBM technique. The effect of diagnosis was investigated in the whole sample and separately exposed to high and low ACE subjects. An effect of diagnosis was observed in orbitofrontal cortex encompassing BA 47 and insula, and in the thalamus. HC had the highest volume and SCZ patients the lowest with BD patients showing an intermediate volume. This pattern persisted only in subjects with high ACE. No differences were observed for low ACE subjects. The three diagnostic groups differ for age and education, previous and current medications, and treatment periods. Our results underline the importance of ACE on the neural underpinnings of psychiatric psychopathology and suggest a major role of exposure to ACE for the GM deficits to reveal in clinical populations. Exposure to early stress is a crucial factor that must be taken in to account when searching for biomarkers of BD and SCZ. ",
pmid_30262893,Salience network structural integrity predicts executive impairment in alcohol use disorders.,,"The neural bases of cognitive impairment(s) in alcohol use disorders (AUDs) might reflect either a global brain damage underlying different neuro-cognitive alterations, or the involvement of specific regions mostly affected by alcohol neuro-toxic effects. While voxel-based-morphometry (VBM) studies have shown a distributed atrophic pattern in fronto-limbic and cerebellar structures, the lack of comprehensive neuro-cognitive assessments prevents previous studies from drawing robust inferences on the specificity of the association between neuro-structural and cognitive impairments in AUDs. To fill this gap, we addressed the neuro-structural bases of cognitive impairment in AUDs, by coupling VBM with an in-depth neuropsychological assessment. VBM results highlighted a diffuse pattern of grey matter reduction in patients, involving the key-nodes of the meso-cortico-limbic (striatum, hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex), salience (insular and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) and executive (inferior frontal cortex) networks. Grey matter density in the insular and anterior cingulate sectors of the salience network, significantly decreased in patients, explained almost half of variability in their defective attentional and working-memory performance. The multiple cognitive and neurological impairments observed in AUDs might thus reflect a specific executive deficit associated with the selective damage of a salience-based neural mechanism enhancing access to cognitive resources required for controlled cognition and behaviour.

pmid_19529923,Neural representation of reward in recovered depressed patients.,,"Anhedonia, a loss of interest and pleasure in normally rewarding stimuli, is a key diagnostic criterion for major depression. It has been suggested that deficits in the processing of reward-relevant stimuli could represent an endophenotype for depression. We hypothesized that people at risk of depression by virtue of a personal history of the illness would show impaired neural responses to a primary rewarding stimulus. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measured the neural response to the sight and flavor of chocolate, and their combination, in 13 unmedicated recovered patients with a history of major depression and 14 healthy controls matched for age and gender. We also examined a control aversive condition consisting of the sight of moldy strawberries and a corresponding unpleasant taste. Participants simultaneously recorded subjective ratings of ""pleasantness,"" ""intensity,"" and ""wanting."" Despite no differences between the groups in stimulus ratings, patients showed decreased neural responses to the pleasant stimulus in the ventral striatum and increases in the caudate nucleus to the aversive stimulus. Furthermore, patients had a diminished neural supralinearity response (the potentiation produced by simultaneous presentation of the sight and flavor of the stimuli) in the prefrontal cortex for both aversive and pleasant conditions. Patients recovered from depression appear to have deficits in the neural basis of reward and may also have impairments in the cross-modal integration of sensory stimuli. These findings support the view that abnormal neural responses to reward may be an endophenotype for depression and a potential target for intervention and prevention strategies. ",
pmid_26511911,The modulation effect of longitudinal acupuncture on resting state functional connectivity in knee osteoarthritis patients.,,"Recent advances in brain imaging have contributed to our understanding of the neural activity associated with acupuncture treatment. In this study, we investigated functional connectivity across longitudinal acupuncture treatments in older patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Over a period of 4 weeks (six treatments), we collected resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans from 30 patients before and after their first, third and sixth treatments. Clinical outcome showed a significantly greater pain subscore on the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) (indicative of improvement) with verum acupuncture than with sham acupuncture. Independent component analysis (ICA) of the resting state fMRI data showed that the right frontoparietal network (rFPN) and the executive control network (ECN) showed enhanced functional connectivity (FC) with the rostral anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortex, a key region in the descending pain modulatory system, in the verum groups as compared to the sham group after treatments. We also found that the rFPN connectivity with the left insula is (1) significantly associated with changes in KOOS pain score after treatments, and (2) significantly enhanced after verum acupuncture treatments as compared to sham treatment. Analysis of the acupuncture needle stimulation scan showed that compared with sham treatment, verum acupuncture activated the left operculum/insula, which also overlaps with findings observed in resting state analysis. Our results suggest that acupuncture may achieve its therapeutic effect on knee OA pain by modulating functional connectivity between the rFPN, ECN and the descending pain modulatory pathway.

pmid_23397317,The ventral pallidum and orbitofrontal cortex support food pleasantness inferences.,,"Food advertisements often promote choices that are driven by inferences about the hedonic pleasures of eating a particular food. Given the individual and public health consequences of obesity, it is critical to address unanswered questions about the specific neural systems underlying these hedonic inferences. For example, although regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) are frequently observed to respond more to pleasant food images than less hedonically pleasing stimuli, one important hedonic brain region in particular has largely remained conspicuously absent among human studies of hedonic response to food images. Based on rodent research demonstrating that activity in the ventral pallidum underlies the hedonic pleasures experienced upon eating food rewards, one might expect that activity in this important 'hedonic hotspot' might also track inferred food pleasantness. To date, however, no human studies have assessed this question. We thus asked human subjects to undergo fMRI and make item-by-item ratings of how pleasant it would be to eat particular visually perceived foods. Activity in the ventral pallidum was strongly modulated with pleasantness inferences. Additionally, activity within a region of the orbitofrontal cortex that tracks the pleasantness of tastes was also modulated with inferred pleasantness. Importantly, the reliability of these findings is demonstrated by their replication when we repeated the experiment at a new site with new subjects. These two experiments demonstrate that the ventral pallidum, in addition to the OFC, plays a central role in the moment-to-moment hedonic inferences that influence food-related decision-making. ",
pmid_15163610,Word retrieval in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study.,,"The cognitive impairment revealed in some non- demented amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients is characterized by executive dysfunction with widely repeated deficits on tests of verbal (letter) fluency. However, conflicting evidence exists of an impairment on other word retrieval tasks, such as confrontation naming, which do not place heavy demands on executive processes. Previous research has demonstrated intact confrontation naming in the presence of verbal fluency deficits, although naming deficits have been described in other studies. In this investigation, functional MRI (fMRI) techniques were employed to explore whether word retrieval deficits and underlying cerebral abnormalities were specific to letter fluency, which are more likely to indicate executive dysfunction, or were also present in confrontation naming, indicating language dysfunction. Twenty-eight non-demented ALS patients were compared with 18 healthy controls. The two groups were matched for age, intelligence quotient, years of education, and anxiety and depression scores. Two compressed-sequence overt fMRI activation paradigms were employed, letter fluency and confrontation naming, which were developed for use with an older and potentially impaired population. In ALS patients relative to controls, the letter fluency fMRI task revealed significantly impaired activation in the middle and inferior frontal gyri and anterior cingulate gyrus, in addition to regions of the parietal and temporal lobes. The confrontation naming fMRI task also revealed impaired activation in less extensive prefrontal regions, including the inferior frontal gyrus and regions of the temporal, parietal and occipital lobes. These changes were present despite matched performance between patients and controls during each activation paradigm. The pattern of dysfunction corresponded to the presence of cognitive deficits on both letter fluency and confrontation naming in the ALS group. This study provides evidence of cerebral abnormalities in ALS in the network of regions involved in language and executive functions. Moreover, the findings further illustrate the heterogeneity of cognitive and cerebral change in ALS. ",
pmid_22387166,Cortical networks for vision and language in dyslexic and normal children of variable socio-economic status.,,"In dyslexia, anomalous activations have been described in both left temporo-parietal language cortices and in left ventral visual occipito-temporal cortex. However, the reproducibility, task-dependency, and presence of these brain anomalies in childhood rather than adulthood remain debated. We probed the large-scale organization of ventral visual and spoken language areas in dyslexic children using minimal target-detection tasks that were performed equally well by all groups. In 23 normal and 23 dyslexic 10-year-old children from two different socio-economic status (SES) backgrounds, we compared fMRI activity to visually presented houses, faces, and written strings, and to spoken sentences in the native or in a foreign language. Our results confirm a disorganization of both ventral visual and spoken language areas in dyslexic children. Visually, dyslexic children showed a normal lateral-to-medial mosaic of preferences, as well as normal responses to houses and checkerboards, but a reduced activation to words in the visual word form area (VWFA) and to faces in the right fusiform face area (FFA). Auditorily, dyslexic children exhibited reduced responses to speech in posterior temporal cortex, left insula and supplementary motor area, as well as reduced responses to maternal language in subparts of the planum temporale, left basal language area and VWFA. By correlating these two findings, we identify spoken-language predictors of VWFA activation to written words, which differ for dyslexic and normal readers. Similarities in fMRI deficits in both SES groups emphasize the existence of a core set of brain activation anomalies in dyslexia, regardless of culture, language and SES, without however resolving whether these anomalies are a cause or a consequence of impaired reading.

pmid_17229828,What does the brain do when you fake it? An FMRI study of pantomimed and real grasping.,,"Given that studying neural bases of actions is very challenging with fMRI, numerous experiments have used pantomimed actions as a proxy to studying neural circuits of real actions. However, the underlying assumption that the same neural mechanisms mediate real and pantomimed actions has never been directly tested. Moreover, the assumption is called into question by neuropsychological evidence suggesting that real actions depend on the dorsal stream of visual processing whereas pretend actions also recruit the ventral stream. Here, we directly tested these ideas in neurologically intact subjects. Ten right-handed participants performed four tasks: 1) grasping real three-dimensional objects, 2) reaching toward the objects and touching them with the knuckle without hand preshaping, 3) pantomimed grasping in an adjacent location where no object was present, and 4) pantomimed reaching toward an adjacent location. As expected, in the anterior intraparietal area, there was significantly higher activation during real grasping than that during real reaching. However, the activation difference between pantomimed grasping and pantomimed reaching did not reach statistical significance. There was also no effect of pantomimed grasping within the ventral stream, including an object-selective area in the lateral occipital cortex. Instead, we found that pantomimed grasping was mediated by right-hemisphere activation, particularly the right parietal cortex. These results suggest that areas typically invoked by real actions may not necessarily be driven by ""fake"" actions. Moreover, pantomimed grasping may not tap object-related areas within the ventral stream, but rather may rely on mechanisms within the right hemisphere that are recruited by artificial and less practiced actions.

pmid_32540629,Altered subcortical emotional salience processing differentiates Parkinson's patients with and without psychotic symptoms.,,"Current research does not provide a clear explanation for why some patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) develop psychotic symptoms. The 'aberrant salience hypothesis' of psychosis has been influential and proposes that dopaminergic dysregulation leads to inappropriate attribution of salience to irrelevant/non-informative stimuli, facilitating the formation of hallucinations and delusions. The aim of this study is to investigate whether non-motivational salience is altered in PD patients and possibly linked to the development of psychotic symptoms. We investigated salience processing in 14 PD patients with psychotic symptoms, 23 PD patients without psychotic symptoms and 19 healthy controls. All patients were on dopaminergic medication for their PD. We examined emotional salience using a visual oddball fMRI paradigm that has been used to investigate early stages of schizophrenia spectrum psychosis, controlling for resting cerebral blood flow as assessed with arterial spin labelling fMRI. We found significant differences between patient groups in brain responses to emotional salience. PD patients with psychotic symptoms had enhanced brain responses in the striatum, dopaminergic midbrain, hippocampus and amygdala compared to patients without psychotic symptoms. PD patients with psychotic symptoms showed significant correlations between the levels of dopaminergic drugs they were taking and BOLD signalling, as well as psychotic symptom scores. Our study suggests that enhanced signalling in the striatum, dopaminergic midbrain, the hippocampus and amygdala is associated with the development of psychotic symptoms in PD, in line with that proposed in the 'aberrant salience hypothesis' of psychosis in schizophrenia.

Functional MRI
Functional connectivity","Chronic pain is a complex physiological and psychological phenomenon. Implicit learning mechanisms contribute to the development of chronic pain and to persistent changes in the central nervous system. We hypothesized that these central abnormalities can be remedied with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Specifically, since regions of the anterior Default Mode Network (DMN) are centrally involved in emotional regulation via connections with limbic regions, such as the amygdala, remediation of maladaptive behavioral and cognitive patterns as a result of CBT for chronic pain would manifest itself as a change in the intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) between these prefrontal and limbic regions. Resting-state functional neuroimaging was performed in patients with chronic pain before and after 11-week CBT (n = 19), as well as a matched (ages 19-59, both sexes) active control group of patients who received educational materials (n = 19). Participants were randomized prior to the intervention. To investigate the differential impact of treatment on intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC), we compared pre-post differences in iFC between groups. In addition, we performed exploratory whole brain analyses of changes in fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF). The course of CBT led to significant improvements in clinical measures of pain and self-efficacy for coping with chronic pain. Significant group differences in pre-post changes in both iFC and fALFF were correlated with clinical outcomes. Compared to control patients, iFC between the anterior DMN and the amygdala/periaqueductal gray decreased following CBT, whereas iFC between the basal ganglia network and the right secondary somatosensory cortex increased following CBT. CBT patients also had increased post-therapy fALFF in the bilateral posterior cingulate and the cerebellum. By delineating neuroplasticity associated with CBT-related improvements, these results add to mounting evidence that CBT is a valuable treatment option for chronic pain. ",

psychopathy","Psychopathy is a disorder characterized by reduced empathy, shallow affect and behaviors that cause victims distress, like threats, bullying and violence. Neuroimaging research in both institutionalized and community samples implicates amygdala dysfunction in the etiology of psychopathic traits. Reduced amygdala responsiveness may disrupt processing of fear-relevant stimuli like fearful facial expressions. The present study links amygdala dysfunction in response to fear-relevant stimuli to the willingness of individuals with psychopathic traits to cause fear in other people. Thirty-three healthy adult participants varying in psychopathic traits underwent whole-brain fMRI scanning while they viewed statements that selectively evoke anger, disgust, fear, happiness or sadness. During scanning, participants judged whether it is morally acceptable to make each statement to another person. Psychopathy was associated with reduced activity in right amygdala during judgments of fear-evoking statements and with more lenient moral judgments about causing fear. No group differences in amygdala function or moral judgments emerged for other emotion categories. Psychopathy was also associated with increased activity in middle frontal gyrus (BA 10) during the task. These results implicate amygdala dysfunction in impaired judgments about causing distress in psychopathy and suggest that atypical amygdala responses to fear in psychopathy extend across multiple classes of stimuli.

resting-state functional connectivity","Knee osteoarthritis is a prevalent disorder with unsatisfactory treatment options. Both physical and mindful exercises may be able to relieve its pain symptoms. We compared the modulatory effects of different exercise modalities on the periaqueductal grey (PAG) and ventral tegmental area (VTA), which play important roles in descending opioidergic pathways and reward/motivation systems in patients with knee osteoarthritis. We recruited and randomised 140 patients into Tai Chi, Baduanjin, stationary cycling, and health education control groups for 12 weeks. Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), functional and structural MRI, and blood biomarkers were measured at the beginning and end of the experiment. We used the PAG and VTA as seeds in resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analysis. Compared with the control group: (i) all exercises significantly increased KOOS pain sub-scores (pain reduction) and serum programmed death 1 (PD-1) concentrations; (ii) all exercises decreased right PAG rsFC with the medial orbital prefrontal cortex, and the decreased rsFC was associated with improvements in knee pain; and (iii) grey matter volume in the medial orbital prefrontal cortex was significantly increased in all exercise groups. There was also significantly decreased rsFC between the left VTA and the medial orbital prefrontal cortex in the Tai Chi and Baduanjin groups. Exercise can simultaneously modulate the rsFC of the descending opioidergic pathway and reward/motivation system and blood inflammation markers. Elucidating the shared and unique mechanisms of different exercise modalities may facilitate the development of exercise-based interventions for chronic pain. ChiCTR-IOR-16009308. ",
pmid_27159875,"Sex and Gender Differences in Risk, Pathophysiology and Complications of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.",,"The steep rise of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and associated complications go along with mounting evidence of clinically important sex and gender differences. T2DM is more frequently diagnosed at lower age and body mass index in men; however, the most prominent risk factor, which is obesity, is more common in women. Generally, large sex-ratio differences across countries are observed. Diversities in biology, culture, lifestyle, environment, and socioeconomic status impact differences between males and females in predisposition, development, and clinical presentation. Genetic effects and epigenetic mechanisms, nutritional factors and sedentary lifestyle affect risk and complications differently in both sexes. Furthermore, sex hormones have a great impact on energy metabolism, body composition, vascular function, and inflammatory responses. Thus, endocrine imbalances relate to unfavorable cardiometabolic traits, observable in women with androgen excess or men with hypogonadism. Both biological and psychosocial factors are responsible for sex and gender differences in diabetes risk and outcome. Overall, psychosocial stress appears to have greater impact on women rather than on men. In addition, women have greater increases of cardiovascular risk, myocardial infarction, and stroke mortality than men, compared with nondiabetic subjects. However, when dialysis therapy is initiated, mortality is comparable in both males and females. Diabetes appears to attenuate the protective effect of the female sex in the development of cardiac diseases and nephropathy. Endocrine and behavioral factors are involved in gender inequalities and affect the outcome. More research regarding sex-dimorphic pathophysiological mechanisms of T2DM and its complications could contribute to more personalized diabetes care in the future and would thus promote more awareness in terms of sex- and gender-specific risk factors.

pmid_22109998,Segregated and overlapping neural circuits exist for the production of static and dynamic precision grip force.,,"A central topic in sensorimotor neuroscience is the static-dynamic dichotomy that exists throughout the nervous system. Previous work examining motor unit synchronization reports that the activation strategy and timing of motor units differ for static and dynamic tasks. However, it remains unclear whether segregated or overlapping blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity exists in the brain for static and dynamic motor control. This study compared the neural circuits associated with the production of static force to those associated with the production of dynamic force pulses. To that end, healthy young adults (n = 17) completed static and dynamic precision grip force tasks during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Both tasks activated core regions within the visuomotor network, including primary and sensory motor cortices, premotor cortices, multiple visual areas, putamen, and cerebellum. Static force was associated with unique activity in a right-lateralized cortical network including inferior parietal lobe, ventral premotor cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In contrast, dynamic force was associated with unique activity in left-lateralized and midline cortical regions, including supplementary motor area, superior parietal lobe, fusiform gyrus, and visual area V3. These findings provide the first neuroimaging evidence supporting a lateralized pattern of brain activity for the production of static and dynamic precision grip force. ",
pmid_20593194,Right hemisphere dysfunction and emotional processing in ALS: an fMRI study.,,"Emotional processing may be abnormal in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Our aim was to explore functional anatomical correlates in the processing of aversive information in ALS patients. We examined the performance of nine non-demented ALS patients and 10 healthy controls on two functional MRI (fMRI) tasks, consisting of an emotional attribution task and a memory recognition task of unpleasant versus neutral stimuli. During the emotional decision task, subjects were asked to select one of three unpleasant or neutral words. During the memory task, subjects were asked to recognize words presented during the previous task. Controls showed, as expected, greater activation in the right middle frontal gyrus during selection of unpleasant than neutral words, and a greater activation mainly in right-sided cerebral areas during the emotional recognition task. Conversely, patients showed a general increase in activation of the left hemisphere, and reduced activation in right hemisphere in both emotional tasks. Such findings may suggest extra-motor neurodegeneration involving key circuits of emotions, mostly negative, commonly involved in FTD. ",

ventral striatum","In the research domain framework (RDoC), dysfunctional reward expectation has been proposed to be a cross-diagnostic domain in psychiatry, which may contribute to symptoms common to various neuropsychiatric conditions, such as anhedonia or apathy/avolition. We used a modified version of the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) paradigm to obtain functional MRI images from 22 patients with schizophrenia, 24 with depression and 21 controls. Anhedonia and other symptoms of depression, and overall positive and negative symptomatology were also measured. We hypothesized that the two clinical groups would have a reduced activity in the ventral striatum when anticipating reward (compared to anticipation of a neutral outcome) and that striatal activation would correlate with clinical measures of motivational problems and anhedonia. Results were consistent with the first hypothesis: two clusters in both the left and right ventral striatum were found to differ between the groups in reward anticipation. Post-hoc analysis showed that this was due to higher activation in the controls compared to the schizophrenia and the depression groups in the right ventral striatum, with activation differences between depression and controls also seen in the left ventral striatum. No differences were found between the two patient groups, and there were no areas of abnormal cortical activation in either group that survived correction for multiple comparisons. Reduced ventral striatal activity was related to greater anhedonia and overall depressive symptoms in the schizophrenia group, but not in the participants with depression. Findings are discussed in relation to previous literature but overall are supporting evidence of reward system dysfunction across the neuropsychiatric continuum, even if the specific clinical relevance is still not fully understood. We also discuss how the RDoC approach may help to solve some of the replication problems in psychiatric fMRI research. ",
pmid_19501062,Emotions in motion: dynamic compared to static facial expressions of disgust and happiness reveal more widespread emotion-specific activations.,,"In social contexts, facial expressions are dynamic in nature and vary rapidly in relation to situational requirements. However, there are very few fMRI studies using dynamic emotional stimuli. The aim of this study was (1) to introduce and evaluate a new stimulus database of static and dynamic emotional facial expressions according to arousal and recognizability investigated by a rating by both participants of the present fMRI study and by an external sample of 30 healthy women, (2) to examine the neural networks involved in emotion perception of static and dynamic facial stimuli separately, and (3) to examine the impact of motion on the emotional processing of dynamic compared to static face stimuli. A total of 16 females participated in the present fMRI study performing a passive emotion perception task including static and dynamic faces of neutral, happy and disgusted expressions. Comparing dynamic stimuli to static faces indicated enhanced emotion-specific brain activation patterns in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) including the amygdala (AMG), fusiform gyrus (FG), superior temporal gyrus (STG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and occipital and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). These regions have been discussed to be associated with emotional memory encoding, the perception of threat, facial identity, biological motion, the mirror neuron system, an increase of emotional arousal, and reward processing, respectively. Post hoc ratings of the dynamic stimuli revealed a better recognizability in comparison to the static stimuli. In conclusion, dynamic facial expressions might provide a more appropriate approach to examine the processing of emotional face perception than static stimuli. ",
pmid_16503328,A functional magnetic resonance imaging study of working memory abnormalities in schizophrenia.,,"Previous neuroimaging studies of working memory (WM) in schizophrenia, typically focusing on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, yield conflicting results, possibly because of varied choice of tasks and analysis techniques. We examined neural function changes at several WM loads to derive a more complete picture of WM dysfunction in schizophrenia. We used a version of the Sternberg Item Recognition Paradigm to test WM function at five distinct loads. Eighteen schizophrenia patients and 18 matched healthy controls were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 Tesla. Patterns of both overactivation and underactivation in patients were observed depending on WM load. Patients' activation was generally less responsive to load changes than control subjects', and different patterns of between-group differences were observed for memory encoding and retrieval. In the specific case of successful retrieval, patients recruited additional neural circuits unused by control subjects. Behavioral effects were generally consistent with these imaging results. Differential findings of overactivation and underactivation may be attributable to patients' decreased ability to focus and allocate neural resources at task-appropriate levels. Additionally, differences between encoding and retrieval suggest that WM dysfunction may be manifested differently during the distinct phases of encoding, maintenance, and retrieval. ",
pmid_21060689,Motor network degeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a structural and functional connectivity study.,,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterised by motor neuron degeneration. How this disease affects the central motor network is largely unknown. Here, we combined for the first time structural and functional imaging measures on the motor network in patients with ALS and healthy controls. Structural measures included whole brain cortical thickness and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of crucial motor tracts. These structural measures were combined with functional connectivity analysis of the motor network based on resting state fMRI. Focal cortical thinning was observed in the primary motor area in patients with ALS compared to controls and was found to correlate with disease progression. DTI revealed reduced FA values in the corpus callosum and in the rostral part of the corticospinal tract. Overall functional organisation of the motor network was unchanged in patients with ALS compared to healthy controls, however the level of functional connectedness was significantly correlated with disease progression rate. Patients with increased connectedness appear to have a more progressive disease course. We demonstrate structural motor network deterioration in ALS with preserved functional connectivity measures. The positive correlation between functional connectedness of the motor network and disease progression rate could suggest spread of disease along functional connections of the motor network. ",
pmid_17289777,The feeling of familiarity of music and odors: the same neural signature?,,"The feeling of familiarity can be triggered by stimuli from all sensory modalities, suggesting a multimodal nature of its neural bases. In the present experiment, we investigated this hypothesis by studying the neural bases of familiarity processing of odors and music. In particular, we focused on familiarity referring to the participants' life experience. Items were classified as familiar or unfamiliar based on participants' individual responses, and activation patterns evoked by familiar items were compared with those evoked by unfamiliar items. For the feeling of familiarity, a bimodal activation pattern was observed in the left hemisphere, specifically the superior and inferior frontal gyri, the precuneus, the angular gyrus, the parahippocampal gyrus, and the hippocampus. Together with previously reported data on verbal items, visual items, and auditory items other than music, this outcome suggests a multimodal neural system of the feeling of familiarity. The feeling of unfamiliarity was related to a smaller bimodal activation pattern mainly located in the right insula and likely related to the detection of novelty. ",

striatum","The ability to stop a prepared response (reactive inhibition) appears to depend on the degree to which stopping is expected (proactive inhibition). Functional MRI studies have shown that activation during proactive and reactive inhibition overlaps, suggesting that the whole neural network for reactive inhibition becomes already activated in anticipation of stopping. However, these studies measured proactive inhibition as the effect of stop-signal probability on activation during go trials. Therefore, activation could reflect expectation of a stop-signal (evoked by the stop-signal probability cue), but also violation of this expectation because stop-signals do not occur on go trials. We addressed this problem, using a stop-signal task in which the stop-signal probability cue and the go-signal were separated in time. Hence, we could separate activation during the cue, reflecting expectation of the stop-signal, from activation during the go-signal, reflecting expectation of the stop-signal or violation of that expectation. During the cue, the striatum, the supplementary motor complex (SMC), and the midbrain activated. During the go-signal, the right inferior parietal cortex (IPC) and the right inferior frontal cortex (IFC) activated. These findings suggest that the neural network previously associated with proactive inhibition can be subdivided into two components. One component, including the striatum, the SMC, and the midbrain, activated during the cue, implicating this network in proactive inhibition. Another component, consisting of the right IPC and the right IFC, activated during the go-signal. Rather than being involved in proactive inhibition, this network appears to be involved in processes associated with violation of expectations. ",
pmid_15627576,Cerebrocerebellar networks during articulatory rehearsal and verbal working memory tasks.,,"Converging evidence has implicated the cerebellum in verbal working memory. The current fMRI study sought to further characterize cerebrocerebellar participation in this cognitive process by revealing regions of activation common to a verbal working task and an articulatory control task, as well as regions that are uniquely activated by working memory. Consistent with our model's predictions, load-dependent activations were observed in Broca's area (BA 44/6) and the superior cerebellar hemisphere (VI/CrusI) for both working memory and motoric rehearsal. In contrast, activations unique to verbal working memory were found in the inferior parietal lobule (BA 40) and the right inferior cerebellum hemisphere (VIIB). These findings provide evidence for two cerebrocerebellar networks for verbal working memory: a frontal/superior cerebellar articulatory control system and a parietal/inferior cerebellar phonological storage system.

pmid_19726030,The effects of psychotherapy on neural responses to rewards in major depression.,,"Unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by anomalous neurobiological responses to pleasant stimuli, a pattern that may be linked to symptoms of anhedonia. However, the potential for psychotherapy to normalize neurobiological responses to pleasant stimuli has not been evaluated. Twelve adults with and 15 adults without MDD participated in two identical functional magnetic resonance imaging scans that used a Wheel of Fortune task. Between scans, MDD outpatients received Behavioral Activation Therapy for Depression, a psychotherapy modality designed to increase engagement with rewarding stimuli and reduce avoidance behaviors. Seventy-five percent of adults with MDD were treatment responders, achieving post-treatment Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score of six or below. Relative to changes in brain function in the matched nondepressed group, psychotherapy resulted in functional changes in structures that mediate responses to rewards, including the paracingulate gyrus during reward selection, the right caudate nucleus (i.e., the dorsal striatum), during reward anticipation, and the paracingulate and orbital frontal gyri during reward feedback. There was no effect of diagnostic status or psychotherapy on in-scanner task-related behavioral responses. Behavioral Activation Therapy for Depression, a psychotherapy modality designed to increase engagement with rewarding stimuli and reduce avoidance behaviors, results in improved functioning of unique reward structures during different temporal phases of responses to pleasurable stimuli, including the dorsal striatum during reward anticipation.

Participants included 16 women between the ages of 73 and 84 who were part of a randomized controlled double-blind study to evaluate the effect of an ultralow dose micronized estradiol on bone. No significant differences in behavioral performance were found with ERT. However, there was evidence that ERT group participants had both reductions and increases in the amplitude of hemodynamic response in a variety of subcortical and cortical brain regions. These included regions involved in perception and attention such as the occipital and parietal lobes, motor cortex, anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that estrogen may facilitate the efficiency of brain function during the performance of sustained attention tasks in post-menopausal elderly women. ",

Schizophrenia
fMRI","Amotivation in schizophrenia is a central predictor of poor functioning, and is thought to occur due to deficits in anticipating future rewards, suggesting that impairments in anticipating pleasure can contribute to functional disability in schizophrenia. In healthy comparison (HC) participants, reward anticipation is associated with activity in frontal-striatal networks. By contrast, schizophrenia (SZ) participants show hypoactivation within these frontal-striatal networks during this motivated anticipatory brain state. Here, we examined neural activation in SZ and HC participants during the anticipatory phase of stimuli that predicted immediate upcoming reward and punishment, and during the feedback/outcome phase, in relation to trait measures of hedonic pleasure and real-world functional capacity. SZ patients showed hypoactivation in ventral striatum during reward anticipation. Additionally, we found distinct differences between HC and SZ groups in their association between reward-related immediate anticipatory neural activity and their reported experience of pleasure. HC participants recruited reward-related regions in striatum that significantly correlated with subjective consummatory pleasure, while SZ patients revealed activation in attention-related regions, such as the IPL, which correlated with consummatory pleasure and functional capacity. These findings may suggest that SZ patients activate compensatory attention processes during anticipation of immediate upcoming rewards, which likely contribute to their functional capacity in daily life.

Here, we combined measurements of intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with task-based fMRI to explore whether altered activity and/or iFC of the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) mediates deficits in emotion recognition in ASD. Fifteen adults with ASD and 15 matched-controls underwent resting-state and task-based fMRI, during which participants discriminated emotional states from point light displays (PLDs). Intrinsic FC of the right pSTS was further examined using 584 (278 ASD/306 controls) resting-state data of the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE). Participants with ASD were less accurate than controls in recognizing emotional states from PLDs. Analyses revealed pronounced ASD-related reductions both in task-based activity and resting-state iFC of the right pSTS with fronto-parietal areas typically encompassing the action observation network (AON). Notably, pSTS-hypo-activity was related to pSTS-hypo-connectivity, and both measures were predictive of emotion recognition performance with each measure explaining a unique part of the variance. Analyses with the large independent ABIDE dataset replicated reductions in pSTS-iFC to fronto-parietal regions. These findings provide novel evidence that pSTS hypo-activity and hypo-connectivity with the fronto-parietal AON are linked to the social deficits characteristic of ASD. ",

static functional network connectivity (s-FNC)","Chronic migraine (CM) is a common and disabling neurological disorder that affects 1-2% of the global population. The aim of the present study was to identify the functional characteristics of the CM brain using static functional connectivity (s-FC), static functional network connectivity (s-FNC), and dynamic functional network connectivity (d-FNC) analyses. In the present study, 17 CM patients and 20 sex- and age-matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We utilized independent component (IC) analysis to identify 13 ICs. These 13 ICs were then classified into the following 6 resting-state networks (RSNs): the default mode network (DMN), executive control network (ECN), dorsal attention network, auditory network (AN), visual network (VN), and cerebellum network. Subsequently, s-FC, s-FNC, and d-FNC analyses of 13 ICs were employed for between-group comparisons. Three temporal metrics (fraction of time spent, mean dwell time, and number of transitions), which were derived from the state-transition vector, were calculated for group comparisons. In addition, correlation analyses were performed between these dynamic metrics and clinical characteristics [mean visual analog scale (VAS) scores, days with headache per month, days with migraine pain feature per month, and disease duration]. In the comparison of s-FC of 13 ICs within RSNs between the CM and HC groups, increased connectivity was observed in the left angular gyrus (Angular_L) of the ECN (IC 2) and the right superior parietal gyrus (Parietal_Sup_R) of the AN (IC 5), and reduced connectivity was found in the left superior frontal gyrus (Frontal_Sup_2_L) of the AN (IC 5) and DMN (IC 19), the right calcarine sulcus (Calcarine_R) of the VN (IC 7), and the left precuneus (Precuneus_L) of the DMN (IC 17) in CM patients. In the comparison of the d-FNC of 13 IC pairs within RSNs between the two groups, the CM group exhibited significantly decreased connections between the DMN (IC 11) and AN (IC 5), and increased connections between the ECN (IC 2, IC 4) and DMN (IC 19), ECN (IC 4) and AN (IC 5), and ECN (IC 4) and VN (IC 13) in state 1. However, no significant differences in s-FNC were observed between the two groups during the s-FNC analysis. Between-group comparisons of three dynamic metrics between the CM and HC groups showed a longer fraction of time spent and mean dwell time in state 2 for CM patients. Furthermore, from the correlation analyses between these metrics and clinical characteristics, we observed a significant positive correlation between the number of transitions and mean VAS scores. Our findings suggest that functional features of the CM brain may fluctuate over time instead of remaining static, and provide further evidence that migraine chronification may be related to abnormal pattern connectivity between sensory and cognitive brain networks.

pmid_21454920,Brain structure abnormalities in early-onset and adolescent-onset conduct disorder.,,"The developmental taxonomic theory proposes that neurodevelopmental factors play a critical role in the etiology of early-onset conduct disorder, whereas adolescent-onset conduct disorder arises as a result of social mimicry of deviant peers. Recent studies have challenged this theory by demonstrating that adolescents with both early- and adolescent-onset forms of conduct disorder show impaired emotional learning and abnormal neural activation during facial expression processing. The present study extends this work by investigating brain structure in both subtypes of conduct disorder. Voxel-based morphometry was used to compare gray matter volumes in four regions of interest (amygdala, insula, anterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortex) in male adolescents with early-onset (N=36) or adolescent-onset (N=27) conduct disorder and in healthy comparison subjects (N=27). Whole-brain structural analyses were also performed. The combined conduct disorder group displayed gray matter volume reductions in the bilateral amygdala, extending into the insula, relative to healthy comparison subjects. Separate comparisons between healthy subjects and each conduct disorder subgroup revealed lower amygdala volume in both subgroups and reduced right insula volume in the adolescent-onset subgroup. Regression analyses within the conduct disorder subjects alone demonstrated a negative correlation between conduct disorder symptoms and right insula volume. The results demonstrate that gray matter volume reductions in brain regions involved in processing socioemotional stimuli are associated with conduct disorder, regardless of age of onset. Brain structural abnormalities may contribute to the emergence of adolescent-onset as well as early-onset conduct disorder. ",

Game playing may have positive health associations, whereas IGD has been repeatedly associated with negative health measures, and it is thus important to understand differences between individuals with IGD, recreational (non-problematic) game use (RGU) and non-/low-frequency game use (NLFGU). Individuals with IGD have shown differences in neural activations from non-gamers, yet few studies have examined neural differences between individuals with IGD, RGU and NLFGU. Eighteen individuals with IGD, 21 with RGU and 19 with NFLGU performed a color-word Stroop task and a guessing task assessing reward/loss processing. Behavioral and functional imaging data were collected and compared between groups. RGU and NLFGU subjects showed lower Stroop effects as compared with those with IGD. RGU subjects as compared to those with IGD demonstrated less frontal cortical activation brain activation during Stroop performance. During the guessing task, RGU subjects showed greater cortico-striatal activations than IGD subjects during processing of winning outcomes and greater frontal brain during processing of losing outcomes. Findings suggest that RGU as compared with IGD subjects show greater executive control and greater activations of brain regions implicated in motivational processes during reward processing and greater cortical activations during loss processing. These findings suggest neural and behavioral features distinguishing RGU from IGD and mechanisms by which RGU may be motivated to play online games frequently yet avoid developing IGD. ",

The extent to which abnormal reward-related neural signals can be observed in chronic, medicated patients with schizophrenia (SZ), however, is not clear. In an fMRI study involving 17 chronic outpatients with SZ and 17 matched controls, we used a monetary incentive delay (MID) task, in which different-colored shapes predicted gains, losses, or neutral outcomes. Subjects needed to respond to a target within a time window in order to receive the indicated gain or avoid the indicated loss. Group differences in blood-oxygen-level-dependent responses to cues and outcomes were assessed through voxel-wise whole-brain analyses and regions-of-interest analyses in the neostriatum and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Significant group by outcome valence interactions were observed in the medial and lateral PFC, lateral temporal cortex, and amygdalae, such that controls, but not patients, showed greater activation for gains, relative to losses. In the striatum, neural activity was modulated by outcome magnitude in both groups. Additionally, we found that ratings of negative symptoms in patients correlated with sensitivity to obtained losses in medial PFC, obtained gains in lateral PFC, and anticipated gains in left ventral striatum. Sensitivity to obtained gains in lateral PFC also correlated with positive symptom scores in patients. Our findings of systematic relationships between clinical symptoms and neural responses to stimuli associated with rewards and punishments offer promise that reward-related neural responses may provide sensitive probes of the effectiveness of treatments for negative symptoms.

Investigations of medication-free subjects suffering from a current major depressive episode who underwent positron emission tomography (PET) or functional or structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans prior to the initiation of treatment were reviewed. Results of 20 studies from 15 independent samples were included in the functional imaging meta-analysis and 9 studies from 6 independent samples in the structural neuroimaging meta-analysis. Regional activations with prognostic value include the well replicated finding that increased baseline activity in the anterior cingulate is predictive of a higher likelihood of improvement. As well, increased baseline activation in the insula and striatum is associated with higher likelihood of a poorer clinical response. Structural neuroimaging studies indicated that a decrease in right hippocampal volume is a statistically significant predictor of poorer treatment response. Overall, the predictive information that is measurable with brain imaging techniques is both multimodal and regionally distributed as it contains functional as well as structural correlates which encompass several brain regions within a frontostriatal-limbic network. To develop clinically relevant, prognostic markers will require high predictive accuracy at the level of the individual. Predicting clinical response will help to stratify patients and to identify at an early stage those patients who may require more intensive or combined therapies. We propose that structural and functional neuroimaging show significant potential for the development of prognostic markers of clinical response in the treatment of depression. ",

Until now, data comparing anger and aggression in female and male patients with BPD have been widely missing on the behavioral and particularly the brain levels. Thirty-three female and 23 male patients with BPD and 30 healthy women and 26 healthy men participated in this functional magnetic resonance imaging study. We used a script-driven imagery task consisting of narratives of both interpersonal rejection and directing physical aggression toward others. While imagining both interpersonal rejection and acting out aggressively, a sex × group interaction was found in which male BPD patients revealed higher activity in the left amygdala than female patients. In the aggression phase, men with BPD exhibited higher activity in the lateral orbitofrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices compared with healthy men and female patients. Positive connectivity between amygdala and posterior middle cingulate cortex was found in female patients but negative connectivity was found in male patients with BPD. Negative modulatory effects of trait anger on amygdala-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and amygdala-lateral orbitofrontal cortex coupling were shown in male BPD patients, while in female patients trait anger positively modulated dorsolateral prefrontal cortex-amygdala coupling. Trait aggression was found to positively modulate connectivity of the left amygdala to the posterior thalamus in male but not female patients. Data suggest poor top-down adjustment of behavior in male patients with BPD despite their efforts at control. Female patients appear to be less aroused through rejection and to successfully dampen aggressive tension during the imagination of aggressive behavior. ",

fMRI","We investigated the effect of a possible interaction between topical analgesic treatment and treatment expectation on pain at the behavioral and neuronal level by combining topical lidocaine/prilocaine treatment with an expectancy manipulation in a 2 by 2 within-subject design (open treatment, hidden treatment, placebo, control). Thirty-two healthy subjects received heat pain stimuli on capsaicin-pretreated skin and rated their experienced pain during functional magnetic resonance imaging. This allowed us to separate drug- and expectancy-related effects at the behavioral and neuronal levels and to test whether they interact during the processing of painful stimuli. Pain ratings were reduced during active treatment and were associated with reduced activity in the anterior insular cortex. Pain ratings were lower in open treatment compared with hidden treatment and were related to reduced activity in the anterior insular cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the secondary somatosensory cortex, and the thalamus. Testing for an interaction revealed that the expectation effect was significantly larger in the active treatment conditions compared with the no-treatment conditions and was associated with signal changes in the anterior insular cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the ventral striatum. In conclusion, this study shows that even in the case of a topical analgesic, expectation interacts with treatment at the level of pain ratings and neuronal responses in placebo-related brain regions. Our results are highly relevant in the clinical context as they show (i) that expectation can boost treatment and (ii) that expectation and treatment are not necessarily additive as assumed in placebo-controlled clinical trials.

Reappraisal
fMRI","Emotion regulation (ER) is an important skill for well-being. Cognitive reappraisal is a goal-oriented cognitive change strategy. Acceptance involves decentering from immediate habits of reactivity, observing moment-to-moment shifts in thoughts, emotions, and sensations. These two regulation strategies are thought to have different effects on emotion; however, no study has examined the differential effects of reappraisal and acceptance on behavioral, autonomic, and brain responses in the context of ideographic personally salient negative self-beliefs. Thirty-five right-handed, healthy adults were presented idiographic negative self-beliefs embedded in autobiographical scripts. We measured negative emotion ratings, autonomic psychophysiology, and functional magnetic resonance imaging blood oxygen-level dependent responses while participants read neutral statements, reacted to their own negative self-beliefs, and implemented reappraisal and acceptance strategies. Compared with react, reappraisal resulted in significantly lesser negative emotion and respiration rate; no differences in heart rate and skin conductance level; greater brain responses implicated in cognitive control, language, and social cognition; and lesser amygdala responses. Compared with react, acceptance resulted in significantly lesser negative emotion, respiration rate, and heart rate; no difference in skin conductance level; and greater brain responses in networks implicated in cognitive control and attention. Compared with acceptance, reappraisal resulted in significantly lesser negative emotion; no difference in respiration rate and skin conductance level; higher heart rate; greater brain responses in brain regions implicated in cognitive control; and lesser brain responses in amygdala. Reappraisal is more effective than acceptance in down-regulating negative emotion, but may require greater recruitment of autonomic, cognitive, and brain resources.

whole brain functional-connectivity analysis","Published reports of functional abnormalities in schizophrenia remain divergent due to lack of staging point-of-view and whole-brain analysis. To identify key functional-connectivity differences of first-episode (FE) and chronic patients from controls using resting-state functional MRI, and determine changes that are specifically associated with disease onset, a clinical staging model is adopted. We analyze functional-connectivity differences in prodromal, FE (mostly drug naïve), and chronic patients from their matched controls from 6 independent datasets involving a total of 789 participants (343 patients). Brain-wide functional-connectivity analysis was performed in different datasets and the results from the datasets of the same stage were then integrated by meta-analysis, with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Prodromal patients differed from controls in their pattern of functional-connectivity involving the inferior frontal gyri (Broca's area). In FE patients, 90% of the functional-connectivity changes involved the frontal lobes, mostly the inferior frontal gyrus including Broca's area, and these changes were correlated with delusions/blunted affect. For chronic patients, functional-connectivity differences extended to wider areas of the brain, including reduced thalamo-frontal connectivity, and increased thalamo-temporal and thalamo-sensorimoter connectivity that were correlated with the positive, negative, and general symptoms, respectively. Thalamic changes became prominent at the chronic stage. These results provide evidence for distinct patterns of functional-dysconnectivity across FE and chronic stages of schizophrenia. Importantly, abnormalities in the frontal language networks appear early, at the time of disease onset. The identification of stage-specific pathological processes may help to understand the disease course of schizophrenia and identify neurobiological markers crucial for early diagnosis. ",
pmid_17988357,Neural activation during encoding of emotional faces in pediatric bipolar disorder.,,"Neurobiological understanding of bipolar disorder (BD) is limited by a paucity of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research examining correlates of psychological processes. To begin to address these limitations, the current study tests the hypothesis that pediatric BD (PBD) subjects exhibit altered neural activation during encoding of emotional faces compared to typically developing controls. Pediatric BD subjects (n=23; mean age=14.2+/-3.1 years) and controls (n=22; mean age=14.7+/-2.3 years) were matched on age, gender, and IQ. In this event-related fMRI study, subjects were scanned while viewing emotional faces and given a surprise recognition memory test 30 min postscan. Our main outcome measure was between-group differences in neural activation during successful versus unsuccessful face encoding. Pediatric BD youth exhibited reduced memory for emotional faces, relative to healthy comparisons, particularly on fearful faces. Event-related fMRI analyses controlling for this behavioral difference showed that PBD subjects, compared to controls, had increased neural activation in the striatum and anterior cingulate cortex when successfully encoding happy faces and in the orbitofrontal cortex when successfully encoding angry faces. There were no between-group differences in neural activation during fearful face encoding. Our results extend what is known about memory and face emotion processing impairments in PBD subjects by showing increased fronto-striatal activation during encoding of emotional faces. Further work is required to determine the impact of mood state, medication, and comorbid illnesses on these findings. ",
pmid_22715371,Working memory impairment in fibromyalgia patients associated with altered frontoparietal memory network.,,"Fibromyalgia (FM) is a disorder characterized by chronic widespread pain and frequently associated with other symptoms. Patients with FM commonly report cognitive complaints, including memory problem. The objective of this study was to investigate the differences in neural correlates of working memory between FM patients and healthy subjects, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Nineteen FM patients and 22 healthy subjects performed an n-back memory task during MRI scan. Functional MRI data were analyzed using within- and between-group analysis. Both activated and deactivated brain regions during n-back task were evaluated. In addition, to investigate the possible effect of depression and anxiety, group analysis was also performed with depression and anxiety level in terms of Beck depression inventory (BDI) and Beck anxiety inventory (BAI) as a covariate. Between-group analyses, after controlling for depression and anxiety level, revealed that within the working memory network, inferior parietal cortex was strongly associated with the mild (r = 0.309, P = 0.049) and moderate (r = 0.331, P = 0.034) pain ratings. In addition, between-group comparison revealed that within the working memory network, the left DLPFC, right VLPFC, and right inferior parietal cortex were associated with the rating of depression and anxiety? Our results suggest that the working memory deficit found in FM patients may be attributable to differences in neural activation of the frontoparietal memory network and may result from both pain itself and depression and anxiety associated with pain.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging
Polysomnography
Primary insomnia","Primary insomnia (PI) is characterized by difficulties in initiating sleep or maintaining sleep, which lead to many serious diseases. Acupuncture for PI has drawn attention with its effectiveness and safety. However, the operation of choosing acupoints lacks scientific suggestion. Our trial aims to provide reference and scientific basis for the selection of acupoints and to explore its possible mechanism. A patient-assessor-blinded, randomized and sham controlled trial was designed to compare the efficacy of 5-weeks acupuncture at a single acupoint, the combination of multi-acupoints, and a sham point. The Pittsburgh sleep quality index and Athens Insomnia Scale questionnaire were used for the primary clinical outcomes, while polysomnography was performed for the secondary clinical outcomes. The resting state functional MRI was employed to detect the cerebral responses to acupuncture. The brain activity in resting state was measured by calculating the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), which reflected the idiopathic activity level of neurons in the resting state. These results were analyzed by two factorial ANOVA test and post-hoc t-tests. The clinical outcomes suggest that acupuncture could improve clinical symptoms, and the combination of multi-acupoints might lead to a better clinical efficacy. The rs-fMRI results suggested that the brain activity of certain regions was related to the sleep experience, and acupuncture could regulate the activity of these regions. Furthermore, the combination of multi-acupoints could impact more regions which were influenced by the sleep experience. Acupuncture has been proven to be beneficial for PI patients, and the combination of multi-acupoints might improve its efficacy. This trial has been registered on the U.S. National Library of Medicine (https://clinicaltrials.gov) ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02448602 . Registered date: 14/04/2015. ",
pmid_18455308,Default-mode network activity distinguishes amnestic type mild cognitive impairment from healthy aging: a combined structural and resting-state functional MRI study.,,"Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have revealed coactivation in a distributed network that characterizes the default-mode in the human brain. However, details from resting-state imaging in amnestic type mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is poorly understand. Regional homogeneity, which characterizes low-frequency blood oxygenation level dependent fluctuation, after statistically controlling for the regional atrophy and age in resting-state, were examined and compared between the two groups. When regional atrophy was controlled, decreased regional homogeneity in posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus still remained significant in aMCI patients. In addition the aMCI subjects displayed several regions of increased homogeneity, typically in right inferior parietal lobule, right fusiform gyrus and bilateral putamen. The impairment of posterior cingulate and precuneus could be an important marker to distinguish aMCI from healthy aging in the resting-state. Moreover, the increased regional homogeneity changes would be consistent with compensation for damage to the medial temporal regions and limbic structures, perhaps by recruitment of alternative regions.

pmid_11158031,Effects of long-term hormone therapy on cholinergic synaptic concentrations in healthy postmenopausal women.,,"Experimental evidence suggests that gonadal steroids regulate brain neurochemical systems associated with cognitive function, such as the cholinergic system. This study examines the effect of long-term postmenopausal hormone therapy on the brain concentrations of cholinergic synaptic terminals in women using single photon emission computed tomography and the radiotracer [(123)I]iodobenzovesamicol ([(123)I]IBVM). [(123)I]IBVM labels the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) located in the presynaptic terminals of these neurons. Sixteen healthy women treated with hormone therapy since the menopause and 12 women not treated with hormones were studied. There were no significant differences in regional IBVM binding indexes between the 2 groups. The length of hormone replacement therapy correlated positively with VAChT binding indexes in multiple cortical areas (P < 0.05): frontal cortex (Spearman rank correlation: rho = 0.79), parietal cortex (rho = 0.62), temporal cortex (rho = 0.80), anterior cingulate (rho = 0.71), and posterior cingulate (rho = 0.63), but not in the basal ganglia (rho = 0.35; P = 0.2). An earlier onset of menopause in hormone-treated women was associated with higher VAChT indexes in the anterior cingulate (rho = -0.56; P = 0.02) and posterior cingulate (rho = -0.63; P = 0.01). The opposite was found in the posterior cingulate of women not treated with hormones (rho = 0.58; P = 0.04). Women treated with estrogen alone also showed higher VAChT indexes than women treated with estrogen and progestin in the posterior cingulate cortex (by Mann-Whitney U test: z = 2.42; P = 0.015). Although an overall effect of postmenopausal hormone therapy was not found, associations between an index of cortical cholinergic terminal concentrations and the length of hormonal replacement suggest that hormone therapy may influence the survival or plasticity of these cells in postmenopausal women. The data also suggest possible differential effects of estrogen and estrogen with progestin treatments in brain areas critical for cognitive processing. ",
pmid_23428568,Food labels promote healthy choices by a decision bias in the amygdala.,,"Food labeling is the major health policy strategy to counter rising obesity rates. Based on traditional economic theory, such strategies assume that detailed nutritional information will necessarily help individuals make better, healthier choices. However, in contrast to the well-known utility of labels in food marketing, evidence for the efficacy of nutritional labeling is mixed. Psychological and behavioral economic theories suggest that successful marketing strategies activate automatic decision biases and emotions, which involve implicit emotional brain systems. Accordingly, simple, intuitive food labels that engage these neural systems could represent a promising approach for promoting healthier choices. Here we used functional MRI to investigate this possibility. Healthy, mildly hungry subjects performed a food evaluation task and a food choice task. The main experimental manipulation was to pair identical foods with simple labels that emphasized either taste benefits or health-related food properties. We found that such labels biased food evaluations in the amygdala, a core emotional brain system. When labels biased the amygdala's evaluations towards health-related food properties, the strength of this bias predicted behavioral shifts towards healthier choices. At the time of decision-making, amygdala activity encoded key decision variables, potentially reflecting active amygdala participation in food choice. Our findings underscore the potential utility of food labeling in health policy and indicate a principal role for emotional brain systems when labels guide food choices. ",
pmid_20003075,Heightened central affective response to visceral sensations of pain and discomfort in IBS.,,"BACKGROUND Typically, conventional functional imaging methods involve repeated exposures to sensory stimulation. In rectal distension (RD) studies that involve multiple distensions, however, it is difficult to disambiguate the central response to RD from pathological alterations in peripheral neural responses associated with relaxation and accommodation of the rectum. METHODS This study addressed potential confounders found in previous imaging studies by collecting functional magnetic resonance imaging studies (fMRI) data during a single slow ramp-tonic distension paradigm and analysing fMRI signal changes using independent component analysis. KEY RESULTS Compared with controls, IBS participants showed increased activation of the anterior cingulate cortices, insula and ventral medial prefrontal regions suggesting heightened affective responses to painful visceral stimuli. In addition, the failure by IBS patients to down-regulate activity within ventral medial prefrontal and the posterior cingulate/precuneus regions was suggestive of reduced sensitivity to somatic changes and delayed shifts away from rest in ;default network' activity patterns. Controls showed heightened activation of the thalamus, striatal regions and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex suggesting greater arousal and salience-driven sustained attention reactions and greater modulation of affective responses to discomfort and pain. CONCLUSION&INFERENCES This work points to alterations in the central response to visceral pain and discomfort in IBS, highlighting diminished modulation and heightened internalization of affective reactions.

pmid_21365716,Functional networks for cognitive control in a stop signal task: independent component analysis.,,"Cognitive control is a critical executive function of the human brain. Many studies have combined general linear modeling and the stop signal task (SST) to delineate the component processes of cognitive control. For instance, by contrasting stop success (SS) and stop error (SE) trials in the SST, investigators examined the neural processes underlying stop signal inhibition (SS > SE) and error processing (SE > SS). To complement this parameterized approach, here, we employed a data-driven method--independent component analysis (ICA)--to elucidate neural networks and the relationship between neural networks subserving cognitive control. In 59 adults performing the SST during fMRI, we characterized six independent components with ICA. These functional networks, temporally sorted for go success, SS, and SE trials as the events of interest, included a motor cortical network for motor preparation and execution; a right fronto-parietal network for attentional monitoring; a left fronto-parietal network for response inhibition; a midline cortico-subcortical network for error processing; a cuneus-precuneus network for behavioral engagement; and a ""default"" network for self-referential processing. Across subjects the event-associated weights of these functional networks showed a distinct pattern of correlation. These results provide new insight into the component processes of cognitive control. ",
pmid_23261871,Sex-based fMRI differences in obese humans in response to high vs. low energy food cues.,,"Gender specific effects on human eating have been previously reported. Here we investigated sex-based differences in neural activation via whole-brain blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in response to high energy-dense (high-ED) vs. low-ED visual and auditory food cues in obese men vs. women in both fed and fasted states. The results show that in response to high vs. low ED foods in the fed state, obese men (vs. women) had greater activation in brain areas associated with motor control regions (e.g. supplementary motor areas) whereas women showed greater activation in cognitive-related regions. In the fasted state, obese men had greater activation in a visual-attention region whereas obese women showed greater activation in affective and reward related processing regions (e.g. caudate). Overall the results support our a priori hypothesis that obese women (vs. men) have greater neural activation in regions associated with cognition and emotion-related brain regions. These findings may improve our understanding of sex specific differences among obese individuals in eating behavior. ",

Voxel-based morphometry","Previous studies based on voxel-based morphometry (VBM) had revealed brain gray matter (GM) changes in chronic smokers relative to nonsmokers. However, not all studies reported entirely consistent findings, or even opposite. The aim of this study was to conduct a quantitative meta-analysis of VBM studies of chronic smokers. A systematic database search was conducted in PubMed and Web of Knowledge from January 1, 2000 to January 31, 2020 to identify eligible VBM studies. Meta-analysis was performed with the Seed-based d Mapping software package to compare alternations between chronic cigarette smokers and nonsmokers. In addition, meta-regression analysis were performed to examine the influences of cigarette per day, smoking history and FTND. A total of 17 VBM studies including 905 smokers and 1344 nonsmokers met the inclusion criteria. The results of this meta-analysis showed that the chronic smokers showed a robust GM volume decrease in bilateral prefrontal cortex and left insular and a GM increase in the right lingual cortex and left occipital cortex. Moreover, meta-regression analysis showed that cigarette per day, smoking history and FTND were partly associated with GM changes in chronic smokers. This meta-analysis indicated that chronic cigarette smokers had significant and robust brain GM alternations compared with nonsmokers. Longitudinal studies should be performed in the future to explore whether these brain regions could be used as potential therapeutic neuro-target for nicotine dependence. ",
pmid_17196537,Neural predictors of purchases.,,"Microeconomic theory maintains that purchases are driven by a combination of consumer preference and price. Using event-related fMRI, we investigated how people weigh these factors to make purchasing decisions. Consistent with neuroimaging evidence suggesting that distinct circuits anticipate gain and loss, product preference activated the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), while excessive prices activated the insula and deactivated the mesial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) prior to the purchase decision. Activity from each of these regions independently predicted immediately subsequent purchases above and beyond self-report variables. These findings suggest that activation of distinct neural circuits related to anticipatory affect precedes and supports consumers' purchasing decisions. ",
pmid_24205353,Prenatal music exposure induces long-term neural effects.,,"We investigated the neural correlates induced by prenatal exposure to melodies using brains' event-related potentials (ERPs). During the last trimester of pregnancy, the mothers in the learning group played the 'Twinkle twinkle little star'-melody 5 times per week. After birth and again at the age of 4 months, we played the infants a modified melody in which some of the notes were changed while ERPs to unchanged and changed notes were recorded. The ERPs were also recorded from a control group, who received no prenatal stimulation. Both at birth and at the age of 4 months, infants in the learning group had stronger ERPs to the unchanged notes than the control group. Furthermore, the ERP amplitudes to the changed and unchanged notes at birth were correlated with the amount of prenatal exposure. Our results show that extensive prenatal exposure to a melody induces neural representations that last for several months. ",
pmid_10405732,Central nervous pathway for acupuncture stimulation: localization of processing with functional MR imaging of the brain--preliminary experience.,,"To characterize the central nervous system (CNS) pathway for acupuncture stimulation in the human brain by using functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Functional MR imaging of the whole brain was performed in two groups of nine healthy subjects during four stimulation paradigms: real acupuncture at acupoints ST.36 (on the leg) and LI.4 (on the hand) and control stimulations (minimal acupuncture and superficial pricking on the leg). Stimulations were performed in semirandomized, balanced order nested within two experiments. Psychophysical responses (pain, De-Qi effect [characteristic acupuncture effect of needle-manipulation sensation], anxiety, and unpleasantness) and autonomic responses were assessed. Talairach coordinates-transformed imaging data were averaged for a group analysis. Acupuncture at LI.4 and ST.36 resulted in significantly higher scores for De-Qi and in substantial bradycardia. Acupuncture at both acupoints resulted in activation of the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens and deactivation of the rostral part of the anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala formation, and hippocampal complex; control stimulations did not result in such activations and deactivations. Functional MR imaging can demonstrate the CNS pathway for acupuncture stimulation. Acupuncture at ST.36 and LI.4 activates structures of descending antinociceptive pathway and deactivates multiple limbic areas subserving pain association. These findings may shed light on the CNS mechanism of acupuncture analgesia and form a basis for future investigations of endogenous pain modulation circuits in the human brain. ",
pmid_22172578,Pain attenuation through mindfulness is associated with decreased cognitive control and increased sensory processing in the brain.,,"Pain can be modulated by several cognitive techniques, typically involving increased cognitive control and decreased sensory processing. Recently, it has been demonstrated that pain can also be attenuated by mindfulness. Here, we investigate the underlying brain mechanisms by which the state of mindfulness reduces pain. Mindfulness practitioners and controls received unpleasant electric stimuli in the functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner during a mindfulness and a control condition. Mindfulness practitioners, but not controls, were able to reduce pain unpleasantness by 22% and anticipatory anxiety by 29% during a mindful state. In the brain, this reduction was associated with decreased activation in the lateral prefrontal cortex and increased activation in the right posterior insula during stimulation and increased rostral anterior cingulate cortex activation during the anticipation of pain. These findings reveal a unique mechanism of pain modulation, comprising increased sensory processing and decreased cognitive control, and are in sharp contrast to established pain modulation mechanisms. ",
pmid_12030819,Similarities and differences in the neural correlates of episodic memory retrieval and working memory.,,"Functional neuroimaging studies have shown that different cognitive functions activate overlapping brain regions. An activation overlap may occur because a region is involved in operations tapped by different cognitive functions or because the activated area comprises subregions differentially involved in each of the functions. To investigate these issues, we directly compared brain activity during episodic retrieval (ER) and working memory (WM) using event-related functional MRI (fMRI). ER was investigated with a word recognition test, and WM was investigated with a word delayed-response test. Two-phase trials distinguished between retrieval mode and cue-specific aspects of ER, as well as between encoding/maintenance and retrieval aspects of WM. The results revealed a common fronto-parieto-cerebellar network for ER and WM, as well as subregions differentially involved in each function. Specifically, there were two main findings. First, the results differentiated common and specific subregions within the prefrontal cortex: (i) left dorsolateral areas were recruited by both functions, possibly reflecting monitoring operations; (ii) bilateral anterior and ventrolateral areas were more activated during ER than during WM, possibly reflecting retrieval mode and cue-specific ER operations, respectively; and (iii) left posterior/ventral (Broca's area) and bilateral posterior/dorsal areas were more activated during WM than during ER, possibly reflecting phonological and generic WM operations, respectively. Second, hippocampal and parahippocampal regions were activated not only for ER but also for WM. This result suggests that indexing operations mediated by the medial temporal lobes apply to both long-term and short-term memory traces. Overall, our results show that direct cross-function comparisons are critical to understand the role of different brain regions in various cognitive functions. ",

Executive function
Internet addiction
fMRI","In this study, we designed a continuous wins-and-losses task to monitor the mental activities during decision-making and their effects on subsequent decisions in Internet addiction disorder (IAD) subjects. In behavioral performance, IAD subjects show longer response time, lower repeat rate and greater Stroop effect than healthy controls. In neuroimaging results, IAD subjects show increased brain activities in the inferior frontal cortex, insula, anterior cingulate cortex and decreased activation in the caudate and posterior cingulate cortex after continuous wins than healthy controls. In addition, IAD subjects show increased brain activities in the inferior frontal gyrus and decreased brain activation in the posterior cingulate cortex after continuous losses. Thus, we concluded that IAD subjects engage more cognitive activities to finish the decision-making task. As a result, they cannot sufficiently focus on the executive function during this process. They also do not pay adequate attention to considering previous selections and relevant outcomes during decision-making. ",
pmid_17209415,Functional anatomy of derivational morphology.,,"Lexical morphology involves two types of suffixes: inflectional suffixes, which have a grammatical function, and derivational suffixes with a word formation function. In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used during processing of Italian derived and inflected words. In the derivational task, subjects were asked to produce nouns derived from verbs and from adjectives (e.g., to observe--observation; kind--kindness). After the presentation of the derived noun, they had to generate the corresponding verb (e.g., failure--to fail: generation task). In the inflectional task, subjects had to produce the past participle of the verb or the plural form of the adjective or the derived noun. Behavioural data were collected in separate sessions in two different conditions. In the first experiment, as in the fMRI study, vocal reaction times (RTs) were measured from the offset of the auditory stimulus to the onset of the participant's response. In the second experiment, run with a different group of participants, RTs were recorded starting from the onset of the auditory stimulus to the onset of the response. The fMRI results showed that, relative to the inflectional task and to a repetition task, the derivational task, but not the verb generation task, brought about an activation of left fronto-parietal regions, documenting a specific involvement of these areas in the processing of derived words. Although less extended, similar activation was found for verb inflection but was absent for noun and adjective plural forms. Analysis of behavioral data indicated that an explanation in terms of task difficulty was unlikely related to the imaging results. ",

midbrain","The brainstem and basal ganglia are important in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Reliable and sensitive detection of neural activity changes in these regions should be helpful in scientific and clinical research on PD. In this study, we used resting state functional MRI and amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) methods to examine spontaneous neural activity in 109 patients with PD. We examined activity in two frequency bands, slow-4 (between 0.027 and 0.073 Hz) and slow-5 (0.010-0.027 Hz). Patients had decreased ALFF in the striatum and increased ALFF in the midbrain, and changes were more significant in slow-4. Additionally, changes in slow-4 in both basal ganglia and midbrain correlated with the severity of the parkinsonism. The ALFF in the caudate nucleus positively correlated with the dose of levodopa, while the ALFF in the putamen negatively correlated with the disease duration in both slow-4 and slow-5 bands. In addition, the ALFF in the rostral supplementary motor area negatively correlated with bradykinesia subscale scores. Our findings show that with a large cohort of patients and distinguishing frequency bands, neural modulations in the brainstem and striatum in PD can be detected and may have clinical relevance. The physiological interpretation of these changes needs to be determined. ",
pmid_26206708,Spatiotemporal neural network dynamics for the processing of dynamic facial expressions.,,"The dynamic facial expressions of emotion automatically elicit multifaceted psychological activities; however, the temporal profiles and dynamic interaction patterns of brain activities remain unknown. We investigated these issues using magnetoencephalography. Participants passively observed dynamic facial expressions of fear and happiness, or dynamic mosaics. Source-reconstruction analyses utilizing functional magnetic-resonance imaging data revealed higher activation in broad regions of the bilateral occipital and temporal cortices in response to dynamic facial expressions than in response to dynamic mosaics at 150-200 ms and some later time points. The right inferior frontal gyrus exhibited higher activity for dynamic faces versus mosaics at 300-350 ms. Dynamic causal-modeling analyses revealed that dynamic faces activated the dual visual routes and visual-motor route. Superior influences of feedforward and feedback connections were identified before and after 200 ms, respectively. These results indicate that hierarchical, bidirectional neural network dynamics within a few hundred milliseconds implement the processing of dynamic facial expressions. ",

Although many studies have investigated these differences in relation to clinical significance, the functional processing circuits and underlying neural mechanisms have not been entirely understood. In this study, regional homogeneity (ReHo) and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) maps were used to explore different spontaneous brain activity patterns in EOPD and LOPD patients. Abnormal synchronizations were found in the motor and emotional circuits of the EOPD group, as well as in the motor, emotional, and visual circuits of the LOPD group. EOPD patients showed functional activity change in the visual, emotional and motor circuits, and LOPD patients only showed increased functional activity in the emotional circuits. In summary, the desynchronization process in the LOPD group was relatively strengthened, and the brain areas with changed functional activity in the EOPD group were relatively widespread. The results might point out different impairments in the synchronization and functional activity for EOPD and LOPD patients. ",
pmid_17065458,Neural mechanisms of expert skills in visual working memory.,,"Expertise can increase working memory (WM) performance, but the cognitive and neural mechanisms of these improvements remain unclear. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the degree to which expertise acquisition is supported by tuning of occipitotemporal object representations and tuning of prefrontal and parietal networks that may support domain-specific WM skills. We trained subjects to become experts in a novel category of complex visual objects and examined brain activity while they performed a WM task with objects from the expert category and from an untrained category. Visual expertise training resulted in improved recognition of expert, compared with untrained objects, and this effect was eliminated in a behavioral experiment by stimulus inversion. These behavioral changes were accompanied by increased recruitment of bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal, posterior parietal, and occipitotemporal cortices during WM encoding and maintenance. Across subjects, behavioral measures of expertise reliably predicted increased activation during maintenance of expert objects in all three regions. These neural expertise effects could not be attributed to differences in low-level stimulus characteristics between the two categories, familiarity with features of expert-domain objects, or familiarity with the WM task. These results are consistent with the idea that visual expertise improves WM performance through tuning of occipitotemporal object representations and through development of lateral prefrontal and posterior parietal networks that mediate the application of domain-specific mnemonic skills.

pmid_20399274,Practice effects in the brain: Changes in cerebral activation after working memory practice depend on task demands.,,"Several studies have examined the neural effects of working memory practice, but due to different task demands, diverse patterns of neural changes have been reported. In the present study, we examined neural effects of practice using a task with different working memory demands within a single practice paradigm. Fifteen adults practiced during 6weeks with a task that required maintenance and manipulation of information under low and high working memory loads. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) data were acquired in the first week and last week of the practice period. Results were compared with results of a control group who did not practice the task. We demonstrated that practice was beneficial for both working memory maintenance and manipulation processes but that these processes were supported by different neural changes. While maintenance trials showed increased activation (i.e., less deactivation) in default-mode regions after practice, manipulation trials experienced increased activation in the striatum. Changes were also observed in left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and left superior parietal cortex (SPC). However, for bilateral DLPFC and left SPC, these changes were not specific to the practice group. These findings illustrate the importance of controlling for test-retest effects in training or intervention studies. Behavioral follow-up tests demonstrated that practice effects lasted over a 6-month period, but the absence of transfer effects indicated that the acquired skills were specific for the practiced working memory task.

pmid_20702071,Structural and functional imaging approaches in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder: does the temporal lobe play a key role?,,"Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by widespread structural and functional abnormalities in the brain. We applied different structural imaging techniques such as voxel-based morphometry (VBM), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) to study anatomical differences between boys with ADHD and healthy controls, as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) together with independent component analysis (ICA) to detect functional alterations. 14 boys with ADHD and 12 controls were included in our study. Results of DTI showed the expected differences in frontal and cerebellar white matter. VBM and MTI indicated group differences in the temporal lobe. Applying ICA to fMRI data, we extracted four components; two positively correlated to our working memory paradigm and two negatively correlated. Positive components included activation in frontal and parietal regions. Negative components showed activation in anterior and posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus and temporal regions, and were interpreted as forming part of the default mode network. Group differences in the inferior temporal lobe were detected. Applying different techniques, we found differences between boys with ADHD and controls mainly located in the temporal lobe. Therefore, we postulate that research on ADHD should broaden its scope by including the temporal lobe as a potentially important locus of abnormalities in ADHD. ",

While studies of other drug populations have shown marked increases in risky decision-making, the literature on cannabis users is not as clear. The current study examined the performance of 17 cannabis users and 14 non-users on the Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART) using behavioral, fMRI and effective connectivity methods. Significant attenuation was found in a functional pathway projecting from the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in cannabis users compared to non-using controls as well as decreases in risk-taking behaviors. These findings suggest that cannabis users may process and evaluate risks and rewards differently than non-users. ",
pmid_24451066,Neural correlates of inhibitory control and visual processing in youths with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: a counting Stroop functional MRI study.,,"Despite evidence of inhibitory control and visual processing impairment in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), knowledge about its corresponding alterations in the brain is still evolving. The current study used counting Stroop functional MRI and the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) to investigate if brain activation of inhibitory control and visual processing would differ in youths with ADHD relative to neurotypical youths. We assessed 25 youths with ADHD [mean age 10.9 (s.d.=2.2) years] and 23 age-, gender- and IQ-matched neurotypical youths [mean age 11.2 (s.d.=2.9) years]. The participants were assessed by using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, third edition, and two tests from the CANTAB: rapid visual information processing (RVP) and pattern recognition memory (PRM) outside the scanner. Youths with ADHD showed more activation than neurotypical youths in the right inferior frontal gyrus [Brodmann area (BA) 45] and anterior cingulate cortex, which were correlated with poorer performance on the RVP test in the CANTAB. In contrast, youths with ADHD showed less activation than neurotypical youths in the left superior parietal lobule (BA 5/7), which was correlated with the percentage of correct responses on the PRM test in the CANTAB. Our findings suggest that youths with ADHD might need more inhibitory control to suppress interference between number and meaning and may involve less visual processing to process the numbers in the counting Stroop task than neurotypical youths.

pmid_12232693,Motor sequence learning with the nondominant left hand. A PET functional imaging study.,,"Whereas the human right hemisphere is active during execution of contralateral hand movements, the left hemisphere is engaged for both contra- and ipsilateral movements, at least for right-handed subjects. Whether this asymmetry is also found during motor learning remains unknown. Implicit sequence learning by the nondominant left hand was examined with the serial reaction time (SRT) task during functional brain imaging. As learning progressed, increases in brain activity were observed in left lateral premotor cortex (PMC) and bilaterally in supplementary motor areas (SMA), with the increase significantly greater in the left hemisphere. The left SMA site was similar to one previously identified with right-hand learning, suggesting that this region is critical for representing a sequence independent of effector. Learning with the left hand also recruited a widespread set of temporal and frontal regions, suggesting that motor skill learning with the nondominant hand develops within both cognitive and motor-related functional networks. After skill acquisition, subjects performed the SRT task with their right hands, and sequence transfer was tested with the original and a mirror-ordered sequence. With the original sequence, the stimulus sequence and series of response locations remained unchanged, but the finger movements were different. With the mirror-ordered sequence, the response sequence involved finger movements homologous to those used during training. Performance of the original and mirror sequence by the right hand was significantly better than with random stimuli. Mirror transformation of the sequence by the right hand was associated with a marked increase in regional activity in the left motor cortex, consistent with a role for sequential transformation at this level of the motor output pathway.

pmid_19679760,Activation of right parietal cortex during memory retrieval of nonlinguistic auditory stimuli.,,"In neuroimaging studies, the left ventral posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is particularly active during memory retrieval. However, most studies have used verbal or verbalizable stimuli. We investigated neural activations associated with the retrieval of short, agrammatical music stimuli (Blackwood, 2004), which have been largely associated with right hemisphere processing. At study, participants listened to music stimuli and rated them on pleasantness. At test, participants made old/new recognition judgments with high/low confidence ratings. Right, but not left, ventral PPC activity was observed during the retrieval of these music stimuli. Thus, rather than indicating a special status of left PPC in retrieval, both right and left ventral PPC participate in memory retrieval, depending on the type of information that is to be remembered.

pmid_20384781,Differential representation of dynamic and static power grip force in the sensorimotor network.,,"Previous studies investigating the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the human sensorimotor cortex during static force (maintained for a few seconds) and dynamic force (repetitive force pulses) resulted in contradictory findings. Therefore, we conducted a whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging study during a visuomotor task requiring the production of either dynamic or static power grip force. Thereby we aimed at clarifying whether the BOLD signal behaves differently with dynamic and static force in the primary motor cortex, and whether it behaves in the same way in all areas and regions involved in force production. In the static condition, participants applied visually guided, isometric grip force on a dynamometer of 20% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and held this force for 21 s. In the dynamic condition, self-paced force pulses of 20% MVC were produced at a rate of 0.5 Hz. Static and dynamic force production activated an overlapping network of sensorimotor cortical and subcortical regions. However, the production of a significantly higher mean static force compared with the dynamic force resulted in a significantly smaller BOLD signal in the contralateral motor cortex, confirming observations of an earlier investigation. In addition, we found that the ipsilateral anterior cerebellum behaved similar to the motor cortex, whereas in all other activated regions the activation during static and dynamic force did not significantly differ. These findings demonstrate that various regions of the sensorimotor network participate differentially in the production and control of low static and dynamic grip force, and raise important questions concerning the interpretation of the BOLD signal with respect to mechanisms of neurovascular coupling.

pmid_8855347,"General and specific brain regions involved in encoding and retrieval of events: what, where, and when.",,"Remembering an event involves not only what happened, but also where and when it occurred. We measured regional cerebral blood flow by positron emission tomography during initial encoding and subsequent retrieval of item, location, and time information. Multivariate image analysis showed that left frontal brain regions were always activated during encoding, and right superior frontal regions were always activated at retrieval. Pairwise image subtraction analyses revealed information-specific activations at (i) encoding, item information in left hippocampal, location information in right parietal, and time information in left fusiform regions; and (ii) retrieval, item in right inferior frontal and temporal, location in left frontal, and time in anterior cingulate cortices. These results point to the existence of general encoding and retrieval networks of episodic memory whose operations are augmented by unique brain areas recruited for processing specific aspects of remembered events.

working memory","Working memory training has been widely used to investigate working memory processes. We have shown previously that visual working memory benefits only from intra-modal visual but not from across-modal auditory working memory training. In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study we examined whether auditory working memory processes can also be trained specifically and which training-induced activation changes accompany theses effects. It was investigated whether working memory training with strongly distinct auditory materials transfers exclusively to an auditory (intra-modal) working memory task or whether it generalizes to a (across-modal) visual working memory task. We used adaptive n-back training with tonal sequences and a passive control condition. The memory training led to a reliable training gain. Transfer effects were found for the (intra-modal) auditory but not for the (across-modal) visual transfer task. Training-induced activation decreases in the auditory transfer task were found in two regions in the right inferior frontal gyrus. These effects confirm our previous findings in the visual modality and extents intra-modal effects in the prefrontal cortex to the auditory modality. As the right inferior frontal gyrus is frequently found in maintaining modality-specific auditory information, these results might reflect increased neural efficiency in auditory working memory processes. Furthermore, task-unspecific (amodal) activation decreases in the visual and auditory transfer task were found in the right inferior parietal lobule and the superior portion of the right middle frontal gyrus reflecting less demand on general attentional control processes. These data are in good agreement with amodal activation decreases within the same brain regions on a visual transfer task reported previously. ",
pmid_19254959,Cortical and subcortical mechanisms for precisely controlled force generation and force relaxation.,,"Gripping objects during everyday manual tasks requires the coordination of muscle contractions and muscle relaxations. The vast majority of studies have focused on muscle contractions. Although previous work has examined the motor cortex during muscle relaxation, the role of brain areas beyond motor cortex remains to be elucidated. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to directly compare slow and precisely controlled force generation and force relaxation in humans. Contralateral primary motor cortex and bilateral caudate nucleus had greater activity during force generation compared with force relaxation. Conversely, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) had greater activity while relaxing force compared with generating force. Also, anterior cingulate cortex had greater deactivation while relaxing force compared with generating force. These findings were further strengthened by the fact that force output parameters such as the amplitude, rate, duration, variability, and error did not affect the brain imaging findings. These results demonstrate that the neural mechanisms underlying slow and precisely controlled force relaxation differ across prefrontal-striatal and motor cortical-striatal circuits. Moreover, this study demonstrates that the DLPFC is not only involved in slow and precisely controlled force generation, but has greater involvement in regulating slow and precisely controlled muscle relaxation.

pmid_20943318,Neural bases of conditioned placebo analgesia.,,"Despite growing interest in the placebo effect, the neural correlates of conditioned analgesia are still incompletely understood. We investigated herein on brain activity during the conditioning and post-conditioning phases of a placebo experimental paradigm, using event-related fMRI in 31 healthy volunteers. Brief laser heat stimuli delivered to one foot (either right or left) were preceded by different visual cues, signalling either painful stimuli alone, or painful stimuli accompanied by a (sham) analgesic procedure. Cues signalling the analgesic procedure were followed by stimuli of lower intensity in the conditioning session, whereas in the test session both cues were followed by painful stimuli of the same intensity. During the first conditioning trials, progressive signal increases over time were found during anticipation of analgesia compared to anticipation of pain, in a medial prefrontal focus centered on medial area BA8, and in bilateral lateral prefrontal foci. These frontal foci were adjacent to, and partially overlapped, those active during anticipation of analgesia in the test session, whose signal changes were related to the magnitude of the placebo behavioral response, and those active during placebo analgesia. Specifically, a large focus in the right prefrontal cortex showed activity related to analgesia, irrespective of the expected side of stimulation. Analgesia was also related to decreased activity, detectable immediately following noxious stimulation, in parietal, insular and cingulate pain-related clusters. Our findings of dynamic changes in prefrontal areas during placebo conditioning, and of direct placebo effects on cortical nociceptive processing, add new insights into the neural bases of conditioned placebo analgesia.

trust","Cooperation and betrayal are universal features of social interactions, and knowing who to trust is vital in human society. Previous studies have identified brain regions engaged by decision making during social encounters, but the mechanisms supporting modification of future behaviour by utilizing social experience are not well characterized. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we show that cooperation and betrayal during social exchanges elicit specific patterns of neural activity associated with future behaviour. Unanticipated cooperation leads to greater behavioural adaptation than unexpected betrayal, and is signalled by specific neural responses in the striatum and midbrain. Neural responses to betrayal and willingness to trust novel partners both decrease as the number of individuals encountered during repeated social encounters increases. We propose that, as social groups increase in size, uncooperative or untrustworthy behaviour becomes progressively less surprising, with cooperation becoming increasingly important as a stimulus for social learning. Effects on reputation of non-trusting decisions may also act to drive pro-social behaviour. Our findings characterize the dynamic neural processes underlying social adaptation, and suggest that the brain is optimized to cooperate with trustworthy partners, rather than avoiding those who might betray us.

pmid_23378222,Neural response to visual sexual cues in dopamine treatment-linked hypersexuality in Parkinson's disease.,,"Hypersexuality with compulsive sexual behaviour is a significant source of morbidity for patients with Parkinson's disease receiving dopamine replacement therapies. We know relatively little about the pathophysiology of hypersexuality in Parkinson's disease, and it is unknown how visual sexual stimuli, similar to the portrayals of sexuality in the mainstream mass media may affect the brain and behaviour in such susceptible individuals. Here, we have studied a group of 12 patients with Parkinson's disease with hypersexuality using a functional magnetic resonance imaging block design exposing participants to both sexual, other reward-related and neutral visual cues. We hypothesized that exposure to visual sexual cues would trigger increased sexual desire in patients with Parkinson's disease with hypersexuality that would correspond to changes in brain activity in regions linked to dopaminergically stimulated sexual motivation. Patients with Parkinson's disease with hypersexuality were scanned ON and OFF dopamine drugs, and their results were compared with a group of 12 Parkinson's disease control patients without hypersexuality or other impulse control disorders. Exposure to sexual cues significantly increased sexual desire and hedonic responses in the Parkinson's disease hypersexuality group compared with the Parkinson's disease control patients. These behavioural changes corresponded to significant blood oxygen level-dependent signal changes in regions within limbic, paralimbic, temporal, occipital, somatosensory and prefrontal cortices that correspond to emotional, cognitive, autonomic, visual and motivational processes. The functional imaging data showed that the hypersexuality patients' increased sexual desire correlated with enhanced activations in the ventral striatum, and cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices. When the patients with Parkinson's disease with hypersexuality were OFF medication, the functional imaging data showed decreases in activation during the presentation of sexual cues relative to rest. These deactivations were not observed when the patients were ON medication, suggesting that dopamine drugs may release inhibition within local neuronal circuits in the cerebral cortex that may contribute to compulsive sexual behaviour. The findings of this study have implications with respect to the potential influence of cue exposure via exposure to mass media in enhancing libido, which in this group of vulnerable patients can lead to devastating social consequences and occasionally, custodial sentences. Stimulation through exposure to sexual visual cues in patients with Parkinson's disease with hypersexuality provides a motivational impetus for seeking this reward behaviour through activations and deactivations of cerebral cortex.

pmid_14691061,Neurophysiological factors in human information processing capacity.,,"What determines how well an individual can manage the complexity of information processing demands when several tasks have to be executed simultaneously? Various theoretical frameworks address the mechanisms of information processing and the changes that take place when processes become automated, and brain regions involved in various types of information processing have been identified, as well as sequences of events in the brain. The neurophysiological substrate of human information processing capacity, i.e. the amount that can be processed simultaneously, is, however, unresolved, as is the basis of inter-individual variability in capacity. Automatization of cognitive functions is known to increase capacity to process additional tasks, but behavioural indices of automatization are poor predictors of processing capacity in individuals. Automatization also leads to a decline of brain activity in the working memory system. In this study, we test the hypothesis that processing capacity is closely related to the way that the brain adjusts to practice of a single cognitive task, i.e. to the changes in neuronal activity that accompany automatization as measured with functional MRI (fMRI). Using a task that taxes the working memory system, and is sensitive to automatization, performance improved while activity in the network declined, as expected. The key finding is that the magnitude of automatization-induced reduction of activity in this system was a strong predictor for the ability to perform two different working memory tasks simultaneously (after scanning). It explained 60% of the variation in information processing capacity across individuals. In contrast, the behavioural measures of automatization did not predict this. We postulate that automatization involves at least two partially independent neurophysiological mechanisms, i.e. (i) streamlining of neuronal communication which improves performance on a single task; and (ii) functional trimming of neuronal ensembles which enhances the capacity to accommodate processing of additional tasks, potentially by facilitating rapid switching of instruction sets or contexts. Finally, this study shows that fMRI can provide information that predicts behavioural output, which is not provided by overt behavioural measures. ",

We tried to explore the activity of brain network by ReHo method in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients and examine the impact of regional brain atrophy on the functional results. Data of both structural magnetic resonance images (MRI) and resting-state functional MRI scans were collected from 36 aMCI patients and 46 age-matched healthy controls. Compared with the HC subjects, the aMCI patients showed significant decreased ReHo areas in the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL), left posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCu), left inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), right supramarginal gyrus (SMG), right fusiform gyrus (FG), bilateral lentiform nucleus (LN) and right cerebellum posterior lobe, with the right IPL being the most significant area. In addition, the aMCI group also had some significant increased ReHo areas in the right medial frontal gyrus (MFG), bilateral postcentral gyrus (PoCG), left cuneus and right lingual gyrus (LG), possibly reflective of some underlining compensatory mechanism. Furthermore, in the aMCI patients, we found the ReHo index of the left PCC was positively correlated with the AVLT-Immediate Recall scores, while the ReHo index of the left cuneus was negatively correlated with the MMSE scores. In addition, we found that after regressing out the identified regional brain atrophy, the significant correlations between fitted ReHo index and clinical variables still remained. Our study indicated that aMCI patients showed significant abnormal local coherence of biological activity in resting state and ReHo could serve as a sensitive biomarker in functional imaging studies of aMCI.

The current study aimed to evaluate whether there were activation differences in Brodmann's area 4 (BA4), Brodmann's area 6 (BA6), cingulate (CG) and cerebellum between MJ-using adolescents and healthy controls (HC) on a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) bilateral finger-tapping task. Twenty-four adolescents (aged 18.2 ± 0.7 years) with heavy MJ use and 24 HC (18.0 ± 1.9) had MRI scans on a 3T Siemens scanner, including a standard bilateral fMRI finger-tapping sequence. Imaging data were analyzed using SPM5 in Matlab. As regions of interest, BA4, BA6, cingulate (CG) and cerebellum were selected, and significant clusters of activity were thresholded at p<0.05, corrected. Healthy controls had significantly greater activation than MJ users for the CG and cerebellum. In addition, activation of the cerebellum and CG correlated with lifetime MJ smokes. This is one of the first studies to evaluate cortico-cerebellar circuits in adolescents with heavy MJ use. The study, which used a bilateral finger-tapping fMRI task, provides evidence for both CG and cerebellar dysfunction in MJ abuse and indicates that lifetime MJ use may impact the developing brain.

pmid_23934234,Functional MRI studies in non-CNS cancers.,,"With increasing survival, cognitive problems after systemic treatment for non-CNS cancers are a growing concern. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a noninvasive neuroimaging technique that has the potential to uncover the neural circuitry underlying cognitive problems after systemic treatment in cancer patients. Here, we provide an in depth review of the 14 fMRI studies that have been published to date on potential neurotoxic side effects of systemic treatment for non-CNS cancers. Cross-sectional studies in breast cancer survivors show a consistent pattern of hypoactivation in prefrontal and parietal brain regions during various executive functioning tasks 5 to 10 years after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy that are sometimes associated with worse cognitive performance compared to cancer-specific or no-cancer controls. These findings suggest reduced neural functioning as a result of chemotherapy in brain regions that support cognitive functioning. With regard to episodic memory, hypoactivation at encoding is followed by hyperactivation at retrieval, suggestive of impairments in memory encoding that are compensated by neural hyperactivation to perform adequate memory retrieval. Prospective studies of executive functioning and episodic memory show a more complex picture of hypo- and hyperactivation that is possibly due to various counteracting mechanisms relatively shortly after chemotherapy. Two small studies in prostate cancer patients, finally, provide preliminary evidence for reduced activation in task-relevant brain regions after androgen deprivation therapy, suggestive of reduction of neural function. Statistical correction for multiple comparisons in the reviewed studies is typically quite lenient. We suggest that future studies should preferably include larger sample sizes to allow proper statistical correction for multiple comparisons and include comprehensive neurocognitive tests and multimodal MRI to facilitate the interpretation of the observed fMRI findings.

pmid_15502603,Event-related FMRI evidence of frontotemporal involvement in aberrant response inhibition and task switching in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.,,"Response inhibition deficits are characteristic of individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies investigating the neural correlates of this dysfunction have used block designs, making it difficult to disentangle activation differences specifically related to response inhibition from activation differences related to subprocesses involved in task performance. The current study was designed to further enhance our understanding of this critical function in individuals with ADHD using event-related fMRI. Ten adolescent boys diagnosed with ADHD, combined type, and 12 typically developing controls completed a Go/NoGo task modified to control for novelty processing. The ADHD group made significantly more errors of omission and more errors of commission than the control group. Further, compared with controls, individuals with ADHD showed marked abnormalities in brain activation during response inhibition, including hypoactivation of the anterior/mid-cingulate cortex extending to the supplementary motor area and hyperactivation of the left temporal gyrus. The authors suggest that underactivation in frontal regions reflects core deficits in response/task-switching abilities for the ADHD group. ",

judgment and decision making
multi-attribute decision making","Making accurate judgments is a core human competence and a prerequisite for success in many areas of life. Plenty of evidence exists that people can employ different judgment strategies to solve identical judgment problems. In categorization, it has been demonstrated that similarity-based and rule-based strategies are associated with activity in different brain regions. Building on this research, the present work tests whether solving two identical judgment problems recruits different neural substrates depending on people's judgment strategies. Combining cognitive modeling of judgment strategies at the behavioral level with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we compare brain activity when using two archetypal judgment strategies: a similarity-based exemplar strategy and a rule-based heuristic strategy. Using an exemplar-based strategy should recruit areas involved in long-term memory processes to a larger extent than a heuristic strategy. In contrast, using a heuristic strategy should recruit areas involved in the application of rules to a larger extent than an exemplar-based strategy. Largely consistent with our hypotheses, we found that using an exemplar-based strategy led to relatively higher BOLD activity in the anterior prefrontal and inferior parietal cortex, presumably related to retrieval and selective attention processes. In contrast, using a heuristic strategy led to relatively higher activity in areas in the dorsolateral prefrontal and the temporal-parietal cortex associated with cognitive control and information integration. Thus, even when people solve identical judgment problems, different neural substrates can be recruited depending on the judgment strategy involved. ",
pmid_17724284,Motor cortex stimulation for pain control induces changes in the endogenous opioid system.,,"Motor cortex stimulation (MCS) for neuropathic pain control induces focal cerebral blood flow changes involving regions with high density of opioid receptors. We studied the possible contribution of the endogenous opioid system to MCS-related pain relief. Changes in opioid receptor availability induced by MCS were studied with PET scan and [(11)C]diprenorphine in eight patients with refractory neuropathic pain. Each patient underwent two preoperative (test-retest) PET scans and one postoperative PET scan acquired after 7 months of chronic MCS. The two preoperative scans, performed at 2 weeks interval, did not show significant differences. Conversely, postoperative compared with preoperative PET scans revealed significant decreases of [(11)C]diprenorphine binding in the anterior middle cingulate cortex (aMCC), periaqueductal gray (PAG), prefrontal cortex, and cerebellum. Binding changes in aMCC and PAG were significantly correlated with pain relief. The decrease in binding of the exogenous ligand was most likely explained by receptor occupancy due to enhanced secretion of endogenous opioids. Motor cortex stimulation (MCS) may thus induce release of endogenous opioids in brain structures involved in the processing of acute and chronic pain. Correlation of this effect with pain relief in at least two of these structures supports the role of the endogenous opioid system in pain control induced by MCS. ",

In high altitude where the oxygen concentration and pressure are very low, human cognitive capability such as working memory has been found to be jeopardized. Such effect might persist with long-term high-altitude residence. The current study investigated the verbal working memory of 28 high-altitude residents with blood level oxygen dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in contrast with that of the 30 sea level residents. All of the subjects were healthy college students, matched on their age, gender ratio and social-economic status; they also did not show any difference on their hemoglobin level. The high-altitude subjects showed longer reaction time and decreased response accuracy in behavioral performance. Both groups showed activation in the typical regions associated with the 2-back verbal working memory task, and the behavioral performance of both groups showed significant correlations with the BOLD signal change amplitude and Granger causality values (as a measure of the interregional effective connectivity) between these regions. With group comparison statistics, the high-altitude subjects showed decreased activation at the inferior and middle frontal gyrus, the middle occipital and the lingual gyrus, the pyramis of vermis, as well as the thalamus. In conclusion, the current study revealed impairment in verbal working memory among high-altitude residents, which might be associated with the impact of prolonged chronic hypoxia exposure on the brain functionality.

Working memory training","While behavioural trials of working memory (WM) training have received much attention in recent years, a lesser explored parallel approach is functional neuroimaging. A small literature has suggested a complex time course for functional activation pattern changes following WM training (i.e. not simply increasing or decreasing due to training); however, no study to date has examined such neuroplastic effects in both the training task (dual n-back) and the fluid intelligence transfer task to which the training is purported to transfer (Raven's Matrices). This study investigated neural correlates of WM training in healthy young adults randomized to six weeks of WM training, or an active control condition (processing speed training) with a pre- and post-training fMRI design. Results indicated significant reductions in activation for the WM trained group in key WM-task related areas for trained WM tasks after training compared to the processing speed active control group. The same pattern of training related decreases in activation for the WM trained group was not observed for the transfer task, which is consistent with null results for all cognitive outcomes of the present trial. The observed pattern of results suggests that repetitive practice with a complex task does indeed lead to neuroplastic processes that very likely represent the reduced demand for attentional control while sub-components of the task become more routinized with practice. We suggest that future research investigate neural correlates of WM training in populations for which WM itself is impaired and/or behavioural trials of WM training have returned more promising results.

The aim of this study is to investigate whether the acupoint specificity exists in two adjacent acupoints. Design and Setting. Two adjacent real acupoints, LR3 (Taichong) and ST44 (Neiting), and a nearby nonacupoint were selected. Thirty-three health volunteers were divided into three groups in random order, and each group only received acupuncture at one of the three points. While they received acupuncture, fMRI scan was performed. Results. The common cerebral activated areas responding to LR3 and ST44 included the contralateral primary somatosensory area (SI) and ipsilateral cerebellum. Acupuncture at LR3 specifically activated contralateral middle occipital gyrus, ipsilateral medial frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobe, middle temporal gyrus, rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), lentiform nucleus, insula, and contralateral thalamus. Stimulation at ST44 selectively activated ipsilateral secondary somatosensory area (SII), contralateral middle frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, lingual gyrus, lentiform nucleus, and bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Conclusions. Acupuncture at adjacent acupoints elicits distinct cerebral activation patterns, and those specific patterns might be involved in the mechanism of the specific therapeutic effects of different acupoints.

In two conditions, the absolute location of the objects was unchanged from the time of encoding (fixed-array conditions), whereas in the other two, the location of the objects was shifted, although the spatial relationship among the objects and landmarks was maintained (shifted-array conditions). Subjects were also scanned in a control condition that made the same perceptual and motor demands as the recognition tasks but that had no mnemonic component. Compared to the control condition, all of the recognition tasks activated both the dorsal and ventral visual pathways bilaterally, but with notable asymmetries. In particular, activation in the right, but not left, inferior temporal gyrus (area 37) was observed when both shifted-array conditions were compared to their respective cue-matched fixed-array conditions. The recognition conditions with landmark cues were associated with focal increases in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the region of the right parahippocampal gyrus. The results support previous reports of involvement of the right mesial temporal region in object-location memory tasks, and suggest that right inferotemporal cortex is involved in extracting the invariant relational features of a visual scene.

Voxel-based morphometry","Previous structural imaging studies have revealed gray matter volume abnormalities to reflect the etiology of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), however, which are confounded by age, medication and comorbidity and also ignore the core feature of brain structure in the executive impairments of ADHD. In the present study, we explored gray matter volume abnormalities in male children and adolescents with ADHD who were drug-naive and without comorbidities, and tried to connect structural data and behavioral executive dysfunction to provide more information regarding the brain-behavior relationships in ADHD. Seventy-two male subjects (37 patients and 35 controls) underwent three-dimensional high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging and executive function assessments, including the Stroop Color-Word Test and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Voxel-based morphometry with diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponentiated Lie algebra was used to identify gray matter volume differences between the ADHD and controls. Correlation analyses were performed to identify neuroanatomical deficits that were associated with executive dysfunctions. Significantly reduced gray matter volumes were identified in the right orbitofrontal cortex, right primary motor/premotor cortex, left anterior cingulate cortex and left posterior midcingulate cortex of ADHD patients compared with controls (P<0.05, corrected for family-wise errors). In patients group, the gray matter volumes of the right orbitofrontal cortex and left posterior midcingulate cortex were positively correlated with the completed categories on the WCST, and the gray matter volume of the left posterior midcingulate cortex was negatively correlated with the total and non-perseverative errors on the WCST (P<0.05). The present findings show gray matter volume reductions in motor regions as well as the orbitofrontal and cingulate cortex; this evidence supports theories that suggest frontal abnormalities in children and adolescents with ADHD at early illness stage. The correlations between structural abnormalities and executive dysfunction suggest that neuroanatomical substrate deficits are implicated in the pathophysiology of ADHD. ",
pmid_28332625,Brain anatomy alterations associated with Social Networking Site (SNS) addiction.,,"This study relies on knowledge regarding the neuroplasticity of dual-system components that govern addiction and excessive behavior and suggests that alterations in the grey matter volumes, i.e., brain morphology, of specific regions of interest are associated with technology-related addictions. Using voxel based morphometry (VBM) applied to structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of twenty social network site (SNS) users with varying degrees of SNS addiction, we show that SNS addiction is associated with a presumably more efficient impulsive brain system, manifested through reduced grey matter volumes in the amygdala bilaterally (but not with structural differences in the Nucleus Accumbens). In this regard, SNS addiction is similar in terms of brain anatomy alterations to other (substance, gambling etc.) addictions. We also show that in contrast to other addictions in which the anterior-/ mid- cingulate cortex is impaired and fails to support the needed inhibition, which manifests through reduced grey matter volumes, this region is presumed to be healthy in our sample and its grey matter volume is positively correlated with one's level of SNS addiction. These findings portray an anatomical morphology model of SNS addiction and point to brain morphology similarities and differences between technology addictions and substance and gambling addictions.

Here, we review emerging research that bridges these levels of analysis by attempting to use group neural activity to forecast aggregate choice. A survey of initial findings suggests that components of group neural activity might forecast aggregate choice, in some cases even beyond traditional behavioral measures. In addition to demonstrating the plausibility of neuroforecasting, these findings raise the possibility that not all neural processes that predict individual choice forecast aggregate choice to the same degree. We propose that although integrative choice components may confer more consistency within individuals, affective choice components may generalize more broadly across individuals to forecast aggregate choice.

Groups were similar for demographic and cognitive variables. Besides anxiety (smaller in TC group), there were no differences between groups in neuropsychological variables. During the Stroop Word Color Task, TC group had smaller brain activation in the right intracalcarine cortex, lateral occipital cortex, and occipital pole, than WA. During N back, TC group presented smaller brain activation in the right frontal pole and superior frontal gyrus. Despite the small number of participants in this preliminary study, both groups had similar cognitive performance, however the Tai Chi group required less brain activation to perform the attention and memory tasks, therefore they may have a more efficient cognitive performance than Water Aerobics group.

The influence of antidepressant medication to the brain activity of depressed patients was not fully excluded. Our findings indicated abnormal brain activity was distributed extensively in depressed patients during resting state, and some symptom domains of depression are separately related to specific abnormal patterns of brain activity.

video","The growth of the internet has spawned new ""attention markets,"" in which people devote increasing amounts of time to consuming online content, but the neurobehavioral mechanisms that drive engagement in these markets have yet to be elucidated. We used functional MRI (FMRI) to examine whether individuals' neural responses to videos could predict their choices to start and stop watching videos as well as whether group brain activity could forecast aggregate video view frequency and duration out of sample on the internet (i.e., on youtube.com). Brain activity during video onset predicted individual choice in several regions (i.e., increased activity in the nucleus accumbens [NAcc] and medial prefrontal cortex [MPFC] as well as decreased activity in the anterior insula [AIns]). Group activity during video onset in only a subset of these regions, however, forecasted both aggregate view frequency and duration (i.e., increased NAcc and decreased AIns)-and did so above and beyond conventional measures. These findings extend neuroforecasting theory and tools by revealing that activity in brain regions implicated in anticipatory affect at the onset of video viewing (but not initial choice) can forecast time allocation out of sample in an internet attention market.

fMRI","Emotional processes might influence freezing of gait (FoG) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. We assessed brain functional MRI (fMRI) activity during a ""FoG-observation-task"" in PD-FoG patients relative to healthy controls. Twenty-four PD-FoG patients and 18 age- and sex-matched healthy controls performed clinical and neuropsychological evaluations, and fMRI experiments including: i) ""FoG-observation-task"" consisting of watching a patient experiencing FoG during a walking task (usually evoking FoG); ii) ""gait-observation-task"" consisting of watching a healthy subject performing similar walking tasks without experiencing FoG. During both tasks, PD-FoG patients showed reduced activity of the fronto-parietal mirror neuron system (MNS) relative to controls. In the ""FoG-observation-task"" relative to the ""gait-observation-task"", PD-FoG patients revealed an increased recruitment of the anterior medial prefrontal cortex and a reduced recruitment of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus relative to controls. Healthy controls in the ""FoG-observation-task"" relative to the ""gait-observation-task"" showed increased recruitment of cognitive empathy areas and decreased activity of the fronto-parietal MNS. Our results suggest that when PD-FoG patients observe a subject experiencing FoG, there is an increased activity of brain areas involved in self-reflection emotional processes and a reduced activity of areas related to motor programming, executive functions and cognitive empathy. These findings support previous evidence on the critical role of the emotional circuit in the mechanisms underlying FoG. ",
pmid_22970227,Recognizing biological motion and emotions from point-light displays in autism spectrum disorders.,,"One of the main characteristics of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are problems with social interaction and communication. Here, we explored ASD-related alterations in 'reading' body language of other humans. Accuracy and reaction times were assessed from two observational tasks involving the recognition of 'biological motion' and 'emotions' from point-light displays (PLDs). Eye movements were recorded during the completion of the tests. Results indicated that typically developed-participants were more accurate than ASD-subjects in recognizing biological motion or emotions from PLDs. No accuracy differences were revealed on two control-tasks (involving the indication of color-changes in the moving point-lights). Group differences in reaction times existed on all tasks, but effect sizes were higher for the biological and emotion recognition tasks. Biological motion recognition abilities were related to a person's ability to recognize emotions from PLDs. However, ASD-related atypicalities in emotion recognition could not entirely be attributed to more basic deficits in biological motion recognition, suggesting an additional ASD-specific deficit in recognizing the emotional dimension of the point light displays. Eye movements were assessed during the completion of tasks and results indicated that ASD-participants generally produced more saccades and shorter fixation-durations compared to the control-group. However, especially for emotion recognition, these altered eye movements were associated with reductions in task-performance. ",
pmid_20060129,Reduced activation and inter-regional functional connectivity of fronto-striatal networks in adults with childhood Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and persisting symptoms during tasks of motor inhibition and cognitive switching.,,"Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children has been associated with fronto-striatal functional abnormalities during tasks of inhibitory control. In adults with ADHD, however, hardly any functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have investigated the neurofunctional correlates of the most compromised cognitive functions of motor response inhibition and no study has investigated cognitive flexibility. In this study we used fMRI to compare brain function and task-relevant inter-regional functional connectivity between 11 medication-naïve adults with persistent inattentive/hyperactive behaviours, followed up from childhood when they had been diagnosed with ADHD, and 14 age-matched healthy controls during a Stop and a cognitive Switch tasks. Whole-brain regression MR analyses were conducted within patients to correlate symptoms with brain activation. Despite comparable task performance, adults with childhood ADHD showed reduced activation compared to controls in bilateral inferior prefrontal cortex, caudate and thalamus during both tasks, as well as in left parietal lobe during the Switch task. Within patients, the severity of the behavioural symptoms was negatively correlated with more extensive activation of similar regions in fronto-striatal, parietal and cerebellar brain areas. In the Stop task, patients showed reduced inter-regional functional connectivity between right inferior fronto-frontal, fronto-striatal and fronto-parietal neural networks. The findings demonstrate that adults with childhood ADHD and persisting behavioural symptoms show strikingly similar patterns of fronto-striatal and parietal dysfunction to those observed in childhood ADHD during the same tasks of inhibitory control. This suggests that neuro-functional abnormalities in ADHD patients are likely to continue between childhood and early adulthood. ",
pmid_32555497,Hunger and BMI modulate neural responses to sweet stimuli: fMRI meta-analysis.,,"Consuming sweet foods, even when sated, can lead to unwanted weight gain. Contextual factors, such as longer time fasting, subjective hunger, and body mass index (BMI), may increase the likelihood of overeating. Nevertheless, the neural mechanisms underlying these moderating influences on energy intake are poorly understood. We conducted both categorical meta-analysis and meta-regression of factors modulating neural responses to sweet stimuli, using data from 30 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) articles incorporating 39 experiments (N = 995) carried out between 2006 and 2019. Responses to sweet stimuli were associated with increased activity in regions associated with taste, sensory integration, and reward processing. These taste-evoked responses were modulated by context. Longer fasts were associated with higher posterior cerebellar, thalamic, and striatal activity. Greater self-reported hunger was associated with higher medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), dorsal striatum, and amygdala activity and lower posterior cerebellar activity. Higher BMI was associated with higher posterior cerebellar and insular activity. Variations in fasting time, self-reported hunger, and BMI are contexts associated with differential sweet stimulus responses in regions associated with reward processing and homeostatic regulation. These results are broadly consistent with a hierarchical model of taste processing. Hunger, but not fasting or BMI, was associated with sweet stimulus-related OFC activity. Our findings extend existing models of taste processing to include posterior cerebellar regions that are associated with moderating effects of both state (fast length and self-reported hunger) and trait (BMI) variables.

We found right caudate and superior frontal regions in both RD and ADHD, along with areas specific to RD and to ADHD that are consistent with current theories on these disorders. Perhaps most importantly, we found a potential neurobiological substrate for RD/ADHD. Further, our findings illustrate both shared and specific contributors to RD/ADHD, supporting two current theories on the comorbidity of RD and ADHD, thereby facilitating future work on potential etiologies of RD/ADHD.

However, regional activity synchrony has not been characterized in ALS. The purpose of this study was to assess regional brain synchrony by calculating regional data coherence of resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI), as well as its correlations to clinical indices. Twelve ALS patients and 12 age- and sex-matched healthy controls underwent rsfMRI scans. Coherence measurement was performed in the sensory-motor network (SMN), a key brain network impaired by ALS. Decreased coherence was found in the superior medial SMN, which was surrounded by increased coherence in the peripheral SMN areas. Decreased regional coherence in the right postcentral gyrus/precentral gyrus/superior frontal gyrus was correlated with high disease severity as indicated by lower ALSFRS-r scores; meanwhile, enhanced regional coherence in left postcentral gyrus and inferior parietal cortex was related to longer disease duration. Finally, increased coherence in left postcentral gyrus corresponds to fast disease progression rate. These ALS-related SMN regional coherence alterations suggest using regional coherence as a potential marker for studying ALS and its progression. ",

However, these findings usually focus on basic emotions, using one or two expression modalities. In addition, cultural similarities and differences in emotion recognition patterns in children with ASC have not been explored before. The current study examined the similarities and differences in the recognition of basic and complex emotions by children with ASC and typically developing (TD) controls across three cultures: Israel, Britain, and Sweden. Fifty-five children with high-functioning ASC, aged 5-9, were compared to 58 TD children. On each site, groups were matched on age, sex, and IQ. Children were tested using four tasks, examining recognition of basic and complex emotions from voice recordings, videos of facial and bodily expressions, and emotional video scenarios including all modalities in context. Compared to their TD peers, children with ASC showed emotion recognition deficits in both basic and complex emotions on all three modalities and their integration in context. Complex emotions were harder to recognize, compared to basic emotions for the entire sample. Cross-cultural agreement was found for all major findings, with minor deviations on the face and body tasks. Our findings highlight the multimodal nature of ER deficits in ASC, which exist for basic as well as complex emotions and are relatively stable cross-culturally. Cross-cultural research has the potential to reveal both autism-specific universal deficits and the role that specific cultures play in the way empathy operates in different countries. ",

We examined gray matter volume with voxel based morphometry (VBM) and low frequency fluctuation (LFF) of BOLD signals as a measure of cerebral activity of 84 cocaine dependent (CD) and 86 healthy control (HC) subjects. We performed a covariance analysis to account for the effects of age and years of alcohol use. Compared to HC, CD individuals showed decreased gray matter (GM) volumes in frontal and temporal cortices, middle/posterior cingulate cortex, and the cerebellum, at p<0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons. The GM volume of the bilateral superior frontal gyri (SFG) and cingulate cortices were negatively correlated with years of cocaine use, with women showing a steeper loss in the right SFG in association with duration of use. In contrast, the right ventral putamen showed increased GM volume in CD as compared to HC individuals. Compared to HC, CD individuals showed increased fractional amplitude of LFF (fALFF) in the thalamus, with no significant overlap with regions showing GM volume loss. These results suggested that chronic cocaine use is associated with distinct changes in cerebral structure and activity that can be captured by GM volume and fALFF of BOLD signals. ",

Finally, voxelwise correlation analyses were performed to explore the relationship among the connectivity changes, cognitive performance, and diabetes-related variables. Patients exhibited decreased degree centrality in the left lingual gyrus and increased centrality in the right insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (corrected  This preliminary study shows that network connectivity is altered in patients with type 2 diabetes, which may provide critical insight into the neural substrate of diabetes-related cognitive decline.

Tinnitus","Tinnitus is a widespread auditory disorder affecting approximately 10-15% of the population, often with debilitating consequences. Although tinnitus commonly begins with damage to the auditory system due to loud-noise exposure, aging, or other etiologies, the exact neurophysiological basis of chronic tinnitus remains unknown. Many researchers point to a central auditory origin of tinnitus; however, a growing body of evidence also implicates other brain regions, including the limbic system. Correspondingly, we and others have proposed models of tinnitus in which the limbic and auditory systems both play critical roles and interact with one another. Specifically, we argue that damage to the auditory system generates an initial tinnitus signal, consistent with previous research. In our model, this ""transient"" tinnitus is suppressed when a limbic frontostriatal network, comprised of ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum, successfully modulates thalamocortical transmission in the auditory system. Thus, in chronic tinnitus, limbic-system damage and resulting inefficiency of auditory-limbic interactions prevents proper compensation of the tinnitus signal. Neuroimaging studies utilizing connectivity methods like resting-state fMRI and diffusion MRI continue to uncover tinnitus-related anomalies throughout auditory, limbic, and other brain systems. However, directly assessing interactions between these brain regions and networks has proved to be more challenging. Here, we review existing empirical support for models of tinnitus stressing a critical role for involvement of ""non-auditory"" structures in tinnitus pathophysiology, and discuss the possible impact of newly refined connectivity techniques from neuroimaging on tinnitus research.

pmid_20102666,"Deficits in facial, body movement and vocal emotional processing in autism spectrum disorders.",,"Previous behavioural and neuroimaging studies of emotion processing in autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) have focused on the use of facial stimuli. To date, however, no studies have examined emotion processing in autism across a broad range of social signals. This study addressed this issue by investigating emotion processing in a group of 23 adults with ASD and 23 age- and gender-matched controls. Recognition of basic emotions ('happiness', 'sadness', 'anger', disgust' and 'fear') was assessed from facial, body movement and vocal stimuli. The ability to make social judgements (such as approachability) from facial stimuli was also investigated. Significant deficits in emotion recognition were found in the ASD group relative to the control group across all stimulus domains (faces, body movements and voices). These deficits were seen across a range of emotions. The ASD group were also impaired in making social judgements compared to the control group and this correlated with impairments in basic emotion recognition. This study demonstrates that there are significant and broad-ranging deficits in emotion processing in ASD present across a range of stimulus domains and in the auditory and visual modality; they cannot therefore be accounted for simply in terms of impairments in face processing or in the visual modality alone. These results identify a core deficit affecting the processing of a wide range of emotional information in ASD, which contributes to the impairments in social function seen in people with this condition.

pmid_15750701,Functional motor compensation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,,The present study investigated the fMRI correlates of functional compensation/neural reorganization of the motor system in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The hypothesis was that ALS patients would recruit additional brain regions compared with controls in a motor task and that activity in these regions would vary as a function of task difficulty. Patients and controls executed a motor task with two sequences (a simple and a more difficult one) of consecutive button presses. Patients and controls both activated brain regions known to be involved in motor execution and control. Activity in ipsilateral motor areas as well as difficulty-related activity in the left cerebellum could only be observed in patients. The behavioral data indicated that the motor task was much more difficult for patients than for controls. At nearly equal difficulty the observed patterns of hemodynamic activity in controls were very similar to those observed in ALS. The findings suggest that functional compensation in ALS relies on existing resources and mechanisms that are not primarily developed as a consequence of the lesion. ,

Previous studies have demonstrated the structural and functional alterations of the insula in schizophrenia. To acquire a full picture of the functional alterations of the insula in schizophrenia, the resting-state fMRI data of 46 patients with schizophrenia and 46 healthy control subjects were collected. We used clustering analysis to divide the insula into three subregions: the dorsal anterior insula (dAI), ventral anterior insula (vAI) and posterior insula (PI). Then, whole-brain functional connectivity analysis was conducted based on these subregions. The results showed that the right dAI and PI in patients exhibited altered functional connections with the primary sensorimotor area. In addition, the right PI of the patients exhibited increased functional correlations with the thalamus. More importantly, the altered functional properties of the right PI were significantly correlated with the severity of the delusion and poor insight in schizophrenia. The results suggested that the right PI might play an important role in self-experience processing in schizophrenia. Accordingly, the right PI should be considered very important in the pathological mechanism of schizophrenia. ",
pmid_26892851,Changes in extra-striatal functional connectivity in patients with schizophrenia in a psychotic episode.,,"In patients with schizophrenia in a psychotic episode, intra-striatal intrinsic connectivity is increased in the putamen but not ventral striatum. Furthermore, multimodal changes have been observed in the anterior insula that interact extensively with the putamen. We hypothesised that during psychosis, putamen extra-striatal functional connectivity is altered with both the anterior insula and areas normally connected with the ventral striatum (i.e. altered functional connectivity distinctiveness of putamen and ventral striatum). We acquired resting-state functional magnetic resonance images from 21 patients with schizophrenia in a psychotic episode and 42 controls. Patients had decreased functional connectivity: the putamen with right anterior insula and dorsal prefrontal cortex, the ventral striatum with left anterior insula. Decreased functional connectivity between putamen and right anterior insula was specifically associated with patients' hallucinations. Functional connectivity distinctiveness was impaired only for the putamen. Results indicate aberrant extra-striatal connectivity during psychosis and a relationship between reduced putamen-right anterior insula connectivity and hallucinations. Data suggest that altered intrinsic connectivity links striatal and insular pathophysiology in psychosis. ",

We determined the effect of Alos on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the absence and presence of rectal or sigmoid stimulation to evaluate 2 hypothesized mechanisms of therapeutic action: peripheral antinociception and inhibition of emotional motor system (EMS) regions in the brain. Forty-nine nonconstipated irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients (26 female) received H(2)(15)O positron emission tomography (PET) brain scans before a randomized, placebo-controlled, 3-week trial with Alos (1-4 mg twice daily). PET scans were repeated after treatment in 37 completers. We assessed rCBF during baseline, rectal distention, and anticipation of undelivered rectal distention. The 3 conditions were repeated after a series of noxious sigmoid distentions. Rectal (45 mm Hg) and sigmoid (60 mm Hg) distentions were performed with a computer-controlled barostat device. Alos treatment, as compared with placebo, improved IBS symptoms and reduced rCBF in 5-HT3R containing regions of the EMS, but not in areas activated by pain. Reduction of rCBF appeared greatest in the absence of visceral stimulation, and was partially reversed by rectal or sigmoid distention. Symptom improvement across sessions was significantly correlated with rCBF decreases in the 5-HT3R-rich amygdala, ventral striatum, and dorsal pons. Reduction in IBS symptoms correlated with a drug-induced reduction in the activity of central autonomic networks mediating emotional expression that was maximal in the absence of nociceptive input.

However, findings remained inconsistent while recent reports point to the posterior parietal cortex as an additional target for research. Moreover, although adult ADHD clinically differs from the childhood presentation little is known about the structural correlates of ADHD in adults. The aim of this study was to clarify the involvement of prefronto-striatal and posterior parietal areas in adult ADHD. Voxel-based morphometry of high resolution MRI scans was applied to analyze volumetric brain differences between 31 adult patients with ADHD and 31 control subjects. The volume of prefrontal, striatal and parietal gray matter was normal. ADHD patients displayed a significant reduction of gray matter volume bilaterally in the early visual cortex (P<0.04). The unexpected finding of visual cortex abnormalities might be related to impairments in early-stage, 'subexecutive"" attentional mechanisms. The results support the notion that executive dysfunction may not be the dominant neurobiological characteristic of ADHD at least in adult patients. The visual cortex deserves more consideration as a potentially important site of dysfunction in adult and possibly childhood ADHD. ",

stop-signal task","Deficient response inhibition in situations involving a trade-off between response execution and response stopping is a hallmark of attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD). There are two key components of response inhibition; reactive inhibition where one attempts to cancel an ongoing response and prospective inhibition is when one withholds a response pending a signal to stop. Prospective inhibition comes into play prior to the presentation of the stop signal and reactive inhibition follows the presentation of a signal to stop a particular action. The aim of this study is to investigate the neural activity evoked by prospective and reactive inhibition in adolescents with and without ADHD. Twelve adolescents with ADHD and 12 age-matched healthy controls (age range 9-18) were imaged while performing the stop signal task (SST). Reactive inhibition activated right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in both groups. ADHD subjects activated IFG bilaterally. In controls, prospective inhibition invoked preactivation of the same part of right IFG that activated during reactive inhibition. In ADHD subjects, prospective inhibition was associated with deactivation in this region. Controls also deactivated the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) during prospective inhibition, whereas ADHD subjects activated the same area. This pattern of activity changes in the same structures, but in opposite directions, was also evident across all phases of the task in various task-specific areas like the superior and middle temporal gyrus and other frontal areas. Differences between ADHD and control participants in task-specific and default mode structures (IFG and MPFC) were evident during prospective, but not during reactive inhibition. ",

To evaluate the differences in brain activation in response to presentation of the patient's own name spoken by a familiar voice (SON-FV) in patients with VS and MCS. By using fMRI, we prospectively studied residual cerebral activation to SON-FV in seven patients with VS and four with MCS. Behavioral evaluation was performed by means of standardized testing up to 3 months post-fMRI. Two patients with VS failed to show any significant cerebral activation. Three patients with VS showed SON-FV induced activation within the primary auditory cortex. Finally, two patients with VS and all four patients with MCS not only showed activation in primary auditory cortex but also in hierarchically higher order associative temporal areas. These two patients with VS showing the most widespread activation subsequently showed clinical improvement to MCS observed 3 months after their fMRI scan. The cerebral responses to patient's own name spoken by a familiar voice as measured by fMRI might be a useful tool to preclinically distinguish minimally conscious state-like cognitive processing in some patients behaviorally classified as vegetative.

Compared with healthy controls, T2DM patients exhibited significantly decreased ALFF values mainly in the frontal and parietal lobes, the bilateral thalumi, the posterior lobe of the cerebellum, and increased ALFF values mainly in the visual cortices. Furthermore, lower ALFF values in the left subcallosal gyrus correlated with lower ankle-brachial index values (r = 0.481, p = 0.020), while lower ALFF values in the bilateral medial prefrontal gyri correlated with higher urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (r =  -0.418, p = 0.047). In addition, most of the regions with increased ALFF values in the visual cortices were found to negatively correlate with MoCA scores. These results confirm that ALFF are altered in many brain regions in T2DM patients, and this is associated with the presence of diabetic vascular disease and poor cognitive performance. These findings may provide additional insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms that mediate T2DM-related cognitive dysfunction, and may also serve as a reference for future research. ",
pmid_12644355,Neural circuitry underlying voluntary suppression of sadness.,,"The ability to voluntarily self-regulate negative emotion is essential to a healthy psyche. Indeed, a chronic incapacity to suppress negative emotion might be a key factor in the genesis of depression and anxiety. Regarding the neural underpinnings of emotional self-regulation, a recent functional neuroimaging study carried out by our group has revealed that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex are involved in voluntary suppression of sexual arousal. As few things are known, still, with respect to the neural substrate underlying volitional self-regulation of basic emotions, here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify the neural circuitry associated with the voluntary suppression of sadness. Twenty healthy female subjects were scanned during a Sad condition and a Suppression condition. In the Sad condition, subjects were instructed to react normally to sad film excerpts whereas, in the Suppression condition, they were asked to voluntarily suppress any emotional reaction in response to comparable stimuli. Transient sadness was associated with significant loci of activation in the anterior temporal pole and the midbrain, bilaterally, as well as in the left amygdala, left insula, and right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) (Brodmann area [BA] 47). Correlational analyses carried out between self-report ratings of sadness and regional blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal changes revealed the existence of positive correlations in the right VLPFC (BA 47), bilaterally, as well as in the left insula and the affective division of the left anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 24/32). In the Suppression condition, significant loci of activation were noted in the right DLPFC (BA 9) and the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (BA 11), and positive correlations were found between the self-report ratings of sadness and BOLD signal changes in the right OFC (BA 11) and right DLPFC (BA 9). These results confirm the key role played by the DLPFC in emotional self-regulation. They also indicate that the right DLPFC and right OFC are components of a neural circuit implicated in voluntary suppression of sadness. ",

fMRI","Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by cognitive deficits (e.g., interference control) and altered reward processing. Cognitive control is influenced by incentive motivation and according to current theoretical models, ADHD is associated with abnormal interactions between incentive motivation and cognitive control. However, the neural mechanisms by which reward modulates cognitive control in individuals with ADHD are unknown. We used event-related functional resonance imaging (fMRI) to study neural responses during a rewarded Stroop color-word task in adolescents (14-17 years) with ADHD (n = 25; 19 boys) and healthy controls (n = 33; 22 boys). Adolescents with ADHD showed increased reward signaling within the superior frontal gyrus and ventral striatum (VS) relative to controls. Importantly, functional connectivity analyses revealed a hyperconnectivity between VS and motor control regions in the ADHD group, as a function of reward-cognitive control integration. Connectivity was associated with performance improvement in controls but not in the ADHD group, suggesting inefficient connectivity. Adolescents with ADHD show increased neural sensitivity to rewards and its interactions with interference control in VS and motor regions, respectively. The findings support theoretical models of altered reward-cognitive control integration in individuals with ADHD. ",

Previous studies have provided evidence about the changes in cognitive control induced by mind-body training. However, the neural correlates underlying the effect of extensive mind-body practice on cognitive control remain largely unknown. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we characterized dynamic fluctuations in large-scale intrinsic connectivity networks associated with mind-body practice, and examined their differences between healthy controls and Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) practitioners. Compared with a control group, the TCC group revealed significantly decreased fractional Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuations (fALFF) in the bilateral frontoparietal network, default mode network and dorsal prefrontal-angular gyri network. Furthermore, we detected a significant association between mind-body practice experience and fALFF in the default mode network, as well as an association between cognitive control performance and fALFF of the frontoparietal network. This provides the first evidence of large-scale functional connectivity in brain networks associated with mind-body practice, shedding light on the neural network changes that accompany intensive mind-body training. It also highlights the functionally plastic role of the frontoparietal network in the context of the ""immune system"" of mental health recently developed in relation to flexible hub theory. ",
pmid_19837178,Dissociable neural circuits for encoding and retrieval of object locations during active navigation in humans.,,"Several cortical and subcortical circuits have been implicated in object location memory and navigation. Uncertainty remains, however, about which neural circuits are involved in the distinct processes of encoding and retrieval during active navigation through three-dimensional space. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure neural responses as participants learned the location of a single target object relative to a small set of landmarks. Following a delay, the target was removed and participants were required to navigate back to its original position. The relative and absolute locations of landmarks and the target object were changed on every trial, so that participants had to learn a novel arrangement for each spatial scene. At encoding, greater activity within the right hippocampus and the parahippocampal gyrus bilaterally predicted more accurate navigation to the hidden target object in the retrieval phase. By contrast, during the retrieval phase, more accurate performance was associated with increased activity in the left hippocampus and the striatum bilaterally. Dividing participants into good and poor navigators, based upon behavioural performance, revealed greater striatal activity in good navigators during retrieval, perhaps reflecting superior procedural learning in these individuals. By contrast, the poor navigators showed stronger left hippocampal activity, suggesting reliance on a less effective verbal or symbolic code by this group. Our findings suggest separate neural substrates for the encoding and retrieval stages of object location memory during active navigation, which are further modulated by participants' overall navigational ability.

pmid_23450288,Disrupted expected value and prediction error signaling in youths with disruptive behavior disorders during a passive avoidance task.,,"Youths with disruptive behavior disorders, including conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder, show major impairments in reinforcement-based decision making. However, the neural basis of these difficulties remains poorly understood. This partly reflects previous failures to differentiate responses during decision making and feedback processing and to take advantage of computational model-based functional MRI (fMRI). Participants were 38 community youths ages 10-18 (20 had disruptive behavior disorders, and 18 were healthy comparison youths). Model-based fMRI was used to assess the computational processes involved in decision making and feedback processing in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, insula, and caudate. Youths with disruptive behavior disorders showed reduced use of expected value information within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex when choosing to respond and within the anterior insula when choosing not to respond. In addition, they showed reduced responsiveness to positive prediction errors and increased responsiveness to negative prediction errors within the caudate during feedback. This study is the first to determine impairments in the use of expected value within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and insula during choice and in prediction error-signaling within the caudate during feedback in youths with disruptive behavior disorders.

fMRI","Despite extensive behavioral evidence of impairments in face processing and expression recognition in adults with alcohol or cannabis use disorders (AUD/CUD), neuroimaging findings have been inconsistent. Moreover, relatively little work has examined the relationship of AUD or CUD symptoms with face or expression processing within adolescents. Given the high prevalence of alcohol and cannabis use during adolescence, understanding how these usage behaviors interact with neural mechanisms supporting face and expression processing could have important implications for youth social and emotional functioning. In this study, adolescents (N = 104) responded to morphed fearful and happy expressions during fMRI and their level of AUD and/or CUD symptoms were related to the BOLD response data. We found that AUD and CUD symptom severity were both negatively related to responses to faces generally. However, whereas this relationship was shown for AUD within ventromedial prefrontal cortex and lingual gyrus, it was shown for CUD within rostromedial prefrontal cortex including anterior cingulate cortex. Additionally, AUD symptom levels were associated with differential responses within medial temporal pole and inferior parietal lobule as a function of expression. These results have potential implications for understanding the social and emotional functioning of adolescents with AUD and CUD symptoms. ",
pmid_23685185,Structural brain anomalies and chronic pain: a quantitative meta-analysis of gray matter volume.,,"The diversity of chronic pain syndromes and the methods employed to study them make integrating experimental findings challenging. This study performed coordinate-based meta-analyses using voxel-based morphometry imaging results to examine gray matter volume (GMV) differences between chronic pain patients and healthy controls. There were 12 clusters where GMV was decreased in patients compared with controls, including many regions thought to be part of the ""pain matrix"" of regions involved in pain perception, but also including many other regions that are not commonly regarded as pain-processing areas. The right hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus were the only regions noted to have increased GMV in patients. Functional characterizations were implemented using the BrainMap database to determine which behavioral domains were significantly represented in these regions. The most common behavioral domains associated with these regions were cognitive, affective, and perceptual domains. Because many of these regions are not classically connected with pain and because there was such significance in functionality outside of perception, it is proposed that many of these regions are related to the constellation of comorbidities of chronic pain, such as fatigue and cognitive and emotional impairments. Further research into the mechanisms of GMV changes could provide a perspective on these findings. Quantitative meta-analyses revealed structural differences between brains of individuals with chronic pain and healthy controls. These differences may be related to comorbidities of chronic pain. ",
pmid_22689216,Mindfulness meditation training alters cortical representations of interoceptive attention.,,"One component of mindfulness training (MT) is the development of interoceptive attention (IA) to visceral bodily sensations, facilitated through daily practices such as breath monitoring. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined experience-dependent functional plasticity in accessing interoceptive representations by comparing graduates of a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction course to a waitlisted control group. IA to respiratory sensations was contrasted against two visual tasks, controlling for attentional requirements non-specific to IA such as maintaining sensation and suppressing distraction. In anatomically partitioned analyses of insula activity, MT predicted greater IA-related activity in anterior dysgranular insula regions, consistent with greater integration of interoceptive sensation with external context. MT also predicted decreased recruitment of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) during IA, and altered functional connectivity between the DMPFC and the posterior insula, putative primary interoceptive cortex. Furthermore, meditation practice compliance predicted greater posterior insula and reduced visual pathway recruitment during IA. These findings suggest that interoceptive training modulates task-specific cortical recruitment, analogous to training-related plasticity observed in the external senses. Further, DMPFC modulation of IA networks may be an important mechanism by which MT alters information processing in the brain, increasing the contribution of interoception to perceptual experience.

pmid_16463149,Subcortical reorganization in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,,"The cerebral cortex reorganizes in response to central or peripheral lesions. Although basal ganglia and cerebellum are key components of the network dedicated to movement control, their role in motor reorganization remains elusive. We therefore tested if slowly progressive neurodegenerative motor disease alters the subcortical functional anatomy of the basal ganglia-thalamo-cerebellar circuitry. Ten patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and ten healthy controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), while executing a simple finger flexion task. Cued by an acoustic trigger, they squeezed a handgrip force transducer with their right hand at 10% of their maximum voluntary contraction force. Movement frequency, amplitude, and force were controlled. Statistical parametric mapping of task-related BOLD-response revealed increased activation in ALS patients as compared to healthy controls. The main activation increases were found in the supplementary motor area, basal ganglia, brainstem, and cerebellum. These findings suggest that degeneration of cortical and spinal motor neurons in ALS leads to a recruitment of subcortical motor structures. These subcortical activation patterns strongly resemble functional activation in motor learning and might therefore represent adaptations of cortico-subcortical motor loops as a - albeit finally ineffective - mechanism to compensate for the ongoing loss of motor neurons in ALS.

pmid_18266495,Clinical and neural correlates of alexithymia in posttraumatic stress disorder.,,"Individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often exhibit deficits in emotional experience and expression, which suggests that certain individuals with PTSD may be alexithymic. In this study, in a sample of 105 individuals with PTSD, clinical correlates of alexithymia included reexperiencing, hyperarousal, numbing, dissociative symptoms, and retrospectively reported experiences of childhood emotional neglect. In a subsample of 26 individuals with PTSD related to a motor vehicle accident, functional neural responses to trauma-script imagery were associated with severity of alexithymia, including increased right posterior-insula and ventral posterior-cingulate activation and decreased bilateral ventral anterior-cingulate, ventromedial prefrontal, anterior-insula, and right inferior frontal cortex activation. Clinical and theoretical implications and future research directions are discussed. ",
pmid_20044889,Neural correlates of abstract verb processing.,,"The present study investigated the neural correlates of the processing of abstract (low imageability) verbs. An extensive body of literature has investigated concrete versus abstract nouns but little is known about how abstract verbs are processed. Spanish abstract verbs including emotion verbs (e.g., amar, ""to love""; molestar, ""to annoy"") were compared to concrete verbs (e.g., llevar, ""to carry""; arrastrar, ""to drag""). Results indicated that abstract verbs elicited stronger activity in regions previously associated with semantic retrieval such as inferior frontal, anterior temporal, and posterior temporal regions, and that concrete and abstract activation networks (compared to that of pseudoverbs) were partially distinct, with concrete verbs eliciting more posterior activity in these regions. In contrast to previous studies investigating nouns, verbs strongly engage both left and right inferior frontal gyri, suggesting, as previously found, that right prefrontal cortex aids difficult semantic retrieval. Together with previous evidence demonstrating nonverbal conceptual roles for the active regions as well as experiential content for abstract word meanings, our results suggest that abstract verbs impose greater demands on semantic retrieval or property integration, and are less consistent with the view that abstract words recruit left-lateralized regions because they activate verbal codes or context, as claimed by proponents of the dual-code theory. Moreover, our results are consistent with distributed accounts of semantic memory because distributed networks may coexist with varying retrieval demands. ",
pmid_24068813,Distinct regions of right temporal cortex are associated with biological and human-agent motion: functional magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological evidence.,,"In human lateral temporal cortex, some regions show specific sensitivity to human motion. Here we examine whether such effects reflect a general biological-nonbiological organizational principle or a process specific to human-agent processing by comparing processing of human, animal, and tool motion in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment with healthy participants and a voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) study of patients with brain damage (77 stroke patients). The fMRI experiment revealed that in the lateral temporal cortex, the posterior superior temporal sulcus shows a preference for human and animal motion, whereas the middle part of the right superior temporal sulcus/gyrus (mSTS/STG) shows a preference for human and functional tool motion. VLSM analyses also revealed that damage to this right mSTS/STG region led to more severe impairment in the recognition of human and functional tool motion relative to animal motion, indicating the causal role of this brain area in human-agent motion processing. The findings for the right mSTS/STG cannot be reduced to a preference for articulated motion or processing of social variables since neither factor is involved in functional tool motion recognition. We conclude that a unidimensional biological-nonbiological distinction cannot fully explain the visual motion effects in lateral temporal cortex. Instead, the results suggest the existence of distinct components in right posterior temporal cortex and mSTS/STG that are associated, respectively, with biological motion and human-agent motion processing.

pmid_27761943,Adaptive working memory training improved brain function in human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive patients.,,"We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an adaptive working memory (WM) training (WMT) program, the corresponding neural correlates, and LMX1A-rs4657412 polymorphism on the adaptive WMT, in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) participants compared to seronegative (SN) controls. A total of 201 of 206 qualified participants completed baseline assessments before randomization to 25 sessions of adaptive WMT or nonadaptive WMT. A total of 74 of 76 (34 HIV, 42 SN) completed adaptive WMT and all 40 completed nonadaptive WMT (20 HIV, 20 SN) and were assessed after 1 month, and 55 adaptive WMT participants were also assessed after 6 months. Nontrained near-transfer WM tests (Digit-Span, Spatial-Span), self-reported executive functioning, and functional magnetic resonance images during 1-back and 2-back tasks were performed at baseline and each follow-up visit, and LMX1A-rs4657412 was genotyped in all participants. Although HIV participants had slightly lower cognitive performance and start index than SN at baseline, both groups improved on improvement index (>30%; false discovery rate [FDR] corrected p < 0.0008) and nontrained WM tests after adaptive WMT (FDR corrected, p ≤ 0.001), but not after nonadaptive WMT (training by training type corrected, p = 0.01 to p = 0.05) 1 month later. HIV participants (especially LMX1A-G carriers) also had poorer self-reported executive functioning than SN, but both groups reported improvements after adaptive WMT (Global: training FDR corrected, p = 0.004), and only HIV participants improved after nonadaptive WMT. HIV participants also had greater frontal activation than SN at baseline, but brain activation decreased in both groups at 1 and 6 months after adaptive WMT (FDR corrected, p < 0.0001), with normalization of brain activation in HIV participants, especially the LMX1A-AA carriers (LMX1A genotype by HIV status, cluster-corrected-p < 0.0001). Adaptive WMT, but not nonadaptive WMT, improved WM performance in both SN and HIV participants, and the accompanied decreased or normalized brain activation suggest improved neural efficiency, especially in HIV-LMX1A-AA carriers who might have greater dopaminergic reserve. These findings suggest that adaptive WMT may be an effective adjunctive therapy for WM deficits in HIV participants. ANN NEUROL 2017;81:17-34. ",
pmid_25738156,Using regional homogeneity to reveal altered spontaneous activity in patients with mild cognitive impairment.,,"Most patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are thought to be in an early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging reflects spontaneous brain activity and/or the endogenous/background neurophysiological process of the human brain. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) rapidly maps regional brain activity across the whole brain. In the present study, we used the ReHo index to explore whole brain spontaneous activity pattern in MCI. Our results showed that MCI subjects displayed an increased ReHo index in the paracentral lobe, precuneus, and postcentral and a decreased ReHo index in the medial temporal gyrus and hippocampus. Impairments in the medial temporal gyrus and hippocampus may serve as important markers distinguishing MCI from healthy aging. Moreover, the increased ReHo index observed in the postcentral and paracentral lobes might indicate compensation for the cognitive function losses in individuals with MCI. ",
pmid_22868877,Improvement of brain reward abnormalities by antipsychotic monotherapy in schizophrenia.,,"CONTEXT Schizophrenic symptoms are linked to a dysfunction of dopamine neurotransmission and the brain reward system. However, it remains unclear whether antipsychotic treatment, which blocks dopamine transmission, improves, alters, or even worsens the reward-related abnormalities. OBJECTIVE To investigate changes in reward-related brain activations in schizophrenia before and after antipsychotic monotherapy with a dopamine D2/D3 antagonist. DESIGN Longitudinal cohort study. SETTING Psychiatric inpatients and outpatients in the Capital Region of Denmark. PARTICIPANTS Twenty-three antipsychotic-naive patients with first-episode schizophrenia and 24 healthy controls initially matched on age, sex, and parental socioeconomic status were examined with functional magnetic resonance imaging while playing a variant of the monetary incentive delay task. INTERVENTIONS Patients were treated for 6 weeks with the antipsychotic compound amisulpride. Controls were followed up without treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Task-related blood oxygen level-dependent activations as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging before and after antipsychotic treatment. RESULTS At baseline, patients, as compared with controls, demonstrated an attenuation of brain activation during reward anticipation in the ventral striatum, bilaterally. After 6 weeks of treatment, patients showed an increase in the anticipation-related functional magnetic resonance imaging signal and were no longer statistically distinguishable from healthy controls. Among the patients, there was a correlation between the improvement of positive symptoms and normalization of reward-related activation. Those who showed the greatest clinical improvement in positive symptoms also showed the greatest increase in reward-related activation after treatment. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this is the first controlled, longitudinal study of reward disturbances in schizophrenic patients before and after their first antipsychotic treatment. Our results demonstrate that alterations in reward processing are fundamental to the illness and are seen prior to any treatment. Antipsychotic treatment tends to normalize the response of the reward system; this was especially seen in the patients with the most pronounced treatment effect on the positive symptoms.

pmid_31875047,Habitual physical activity mediates the acute exercise-induced modulation of anxiety-related amygdala functional connectivity.,,"Aerobic exercise, in relation to physical activity, has been shown to have beneficial effects on anxiety. However, the underlyig neural mechanism remains elusive. Using a within-subject crossover design, this fMRI study examined how exercise (12-min treadmill running versus walking) mediated amygdala reactivity to explicit and implicit (backward masked) perception of emotional faces in young adults (N = 40). Results showed that acute exercise-induced differences of state anxiety (STAI-S) varied as a function of individual's habitual physical activity (IPAQ). Subjects with high IPAQ levels showed significant STAI-S reduction (P < 0.05). Path analyses indicated that IPAQ explained 14.67% of the variance in acute exercise-induced STAI-S differences. Running elicited stronger amygdala reactivity to implicit happiness than fear, whereas walking did the opposite. The exercise-induced amygdala reactivity to explicit fear was associated with the IPAQ scores and STAI-S differences. Moreover, after running, the amygdala exhibited a positive functional connectivity with the orbitofrontal cortex and insula to implicit happiness, but a negative connectivity with the parahippocampus and subgenual cingulate to implicit fear. The findings suggest that habitual physical activity could mediate acute exercise-induced anxiolytic effects in regards to amygdala reactivity, and help establish exercise training as a form of anxiolytic therapy towards clinical applications.

pmid_20665717,Abnormal regional spontaneous neural activity in treatment-refractory depression revealed by resting-state fMRI.,,"Treatment-refractory depression (TRD) represents a large proportion of the depressive population, yet has seldom been investigated using advanced imaging techniques. To characterize brain dysfunction in TRD, we performed resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) on 22 TRD patients, along with 26 matched healthy subjects and 22 patients who were depressed but not treatment-refractory (NDD) as comparison groups. Results were analyzed using a data-driven approach known as Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) analysis which measures the synchronization of spontaneous fMRI signal oscillations within spatially neighboring voxels. Relative to healthy controls, both depressed groups showed high ReHo primarily within temporo-limbic structures, and more widespread low ReHo in frontal, parietal, posterior fusiform cortices, and caudate. TRD patients showed more cerebral regions with altered ReHo than did NDD. Moderate but significant correlations between the altered regional ReHo and measures of clinical severity were observed in some identified clusters. These findings shed light on the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying TRD and demonstrate the feasibility of using ReHo as a research and clinical tool to monitor persistent cerebral dysfunction in depression, although further work is necessary to compare different measures of brain function to elucidate the neural substrates of these ReHo abnormalities.

Studies of the neural circuitry engaged during failed motor inhibition in pediatric bipolar disorder may increase our understanding of the pathophysiology of the illness. The authors tested the hypothesis that children with bipolar disorder and comparison subjects would differ in ventral prefrontal cortex, striatal, and anterior cingulate activation during unsuccessful motor inhibition. They also compared activation in medicated versus unmedicated children with bipolar disorder and in children with bipolar disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) versus those with bipolar disorder without ADHD. The authors conducted an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study comparing neural activation in children with bipolar disorder and healthy comparison subjects while they performed a motor inhibition task. The study group included 26 children with bipolar disorder (13 unmedicated and 15 with ADHD) and 17 comparison subjects matched by age, gender, and IQ. On failed inhibitory trials, comparison subjects showed greater bilateral striatal and right ventral prefrontal cortex activation than did patients. These deficits were present in unmedicated patients, but the role of ADHD in mediating them was unclear. In relation to comparison subjects, children with bipolar disorder may have deficits in their ability to engage striatal structures and the right ventral prefrontal cortex during unsuccessful inhibition. Further research should ascertain the contribution of ADHD to these deficits and the role that such deficits may play in the emotional and behavioral dysregulation characteristic of bipolar disorder.

Invention","Inventive conceptions amount to creative ideas for designing devices that are both original and useful. The generation of inventive conceptions is a key element of the inventive process. However, neural mechanisms of the inventive process remain poorly understood. Here we employed functional feature association tasks and event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate neural substrates for the generation of inventive conceptions. The functional MRI (fMRI) data revealed significant activations at Brodmann area (BA) 47 in the left inferior frontal gyrus and at BA 18 in the left lingual gyrus, when participants performed biological functional feature association tasks compared with non-biological functional feature association tasks. Our results suggest that the left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 47) is associated with novelty-based representations formed by the generation and selection of semantic relatedness, and the left lingual gyrus (BA 18) is involved in relevant visual imagery in processing of semantic relatedness. The findings might shed light on neural mechanisms underlying the inventive process. ",
pmid_22420038,Ventral striatum response during reward and punishment reversal learning in unmedicated major depressive disorder.,,"Affective biases may underlie many of the key symptoms of major depressive disorder, from anhedonia to altered cognitive performance. Understanding the cause of these biases is therefore critical in the quest for improved treatments. Depression is associated, for example, with a negative affective bias in reversal learning. However, despite the fact that reversal learning is associated with striatal response in healthy individuals and depressed individuals exhibit attenuated striatal function on multiple tasks, studies to date have not demonstrated striatal involvement in the negative bias in reversal learning in depression. In this study, the authors sought to determine whether this may be because reversal learning tasks conventionally used to study behavior examine reversals only on the basis of unexpected punishment and therefore do not adequately separate reward- and punishment-based behavior. The authors used functional MRI to compare the hemodynamic response to a reversal learning task with mixed reward- and punishment-based reversal stages between individuals with unmedicated major depressive disorder (N=13) and healthy comparison subjects (N=14). Impaired reward (but not punishment) reversal accuracy was found alongside attenuated anteroventral striatal response to unexpected reward in depression. Attenuated neurophysiological response of the anteroventral striatum may reflect dysfunction in circuits involving afferent projections from the orbitofrontal, limbic, and/or mesostriatal dopaminergic pathways, which conceivably may, together with the ventral striatum, underlie anhedonia in depression. Learning to appreciate and enjoy positive life experiences is critical for recovery from depression. This study pinpoints a neural target for such recovery. ",
pmid_22355302,Pattern recognition and functional neuroimaging help to discriminate healthy adolescents at risk for mood disorders from low risk adolescents.,,"There are no known biological measures that accurately predict future development of psychiatric disorders in individual at-risk adolescents. We investigated whether machine learning and fMRI could help to: 1. differentiate healthy adolescents genetically at-risk for bipolar disorder and other Axis I psychiatric disorders from healthy adolescents at low risk of developing these disorders; 2. identify those healthy genetically at-risk adolescents who were most likely to develop future Axis I disorders. 16 healthy offspring genetically at risk for bipolar disorder and other Axis I disorders by virtue of having a parent with bipolar disorder and 16 healthy, age- and gender-matched low-risk offspring of healthy parents with no history of psychiatric disorders (12-17 year-olds) performed two emotional face gender-labeling tasks (happy/neutral; fearful/neutral) during fMRI. We used Gaussian Process Classifiers (GPC), a machine learning approach that assigns a predictive probability of group membership to an individual person, to differentiate groups and to identify those at-risk adolescents most likely to develop future Axis I disorders. Using GPC, activity to neutral faces presented during the happy experiment accurately and significantly differentiated groups, achieving 75% accuracy (sensitivity = 75%, specificity = 75%). Furthermore, predictive probabilities were significantly higher for those at-risk adolescents who subsequently developed an Axis I disorder than for those at-risk adolescents remaining healthy at follow-up. We show that a combination of two promising techniques, machine learning and neuroimaging, not only discriminates healthy low-risk from healthy adolescents genetically at-risk for Axis I disorders, but may ultimately help to predict which at-risk adolescents subsequently develop these disorders.

pmid_19833143,Neural responses to rigidly moving faces displaying shifts in social attention investigated with fMRI and MEG.,,"A widely adopted neural model of face perception (Haxby, Hoffman, & Gobbini, 2000) proposes that the posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) represents the changeable features of a face, while the face-responsive fusiform gyrus (FFA) encodes invariant aspects of facial structure. 'Changeable features' of a face can include rigid and non-rigid movements. The current study investigated neural responses to rigid, moving faces displaying shifts in social attention. Both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) were used to investigate neural responses elicited when participants viewed video clips in which actors made a rigid shift of attention, signalled congruently from both the eyes and head. These responses were compared to those elicited by viewing static faces displaying stationary social attention information or a scrambled video displaying directional motion. Both the fMRI and MEG analyses demonstrated heightened responses along the STS to turning heads compared to static faces or scrambled movement conditions. The FFA responded to both turning heads and static faces, showing only a slight increase in response to the dynamic stimuli. These results establish the applicability of the Haxby model to the perception of rigid face motions expressing changes in social attention direction. Furthermore, the MEG beamforming analyses found an STS response in an upper frequency band (30-80 Hz) which peaked in the right anterior region. These findings, derived from two complementary neuroimaging techniques, clarify the contribution of the STS during the encoding of rigid facial action patterns of social attention, emphasising the role of anterior sulcal regions alongside previously observed posterior areas.

pmid_20130250,Willful modulation of brain activity in disorders of consciousness.,,"The differential diagnosis of disorders of consciousness is challenging. The rate of misdiagnosis is approximately 40%, and new methods are required to complement bedside testing, particularly if the patient's capacity to show behavioral signs of awareness is diminished. At two major referral centers in Cambridge, United Kingdom, and Liege, Belgium, we performed a study involving 54 patients with disorders of consciousness. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess each patient's ability to generate willful, neuroanatomically specific, blood-oxygenation-level-dependent responses during two established mental-imagery tasks. A technique was then developed to determine whether such tasks could be used to communicate yes-or-no answers to simple questions. Of the 54 patients enrolled in the study, 5 were able to willfully modulate their brain activity. In three of these patients, additional bedside testing revealed some sign of awareness, but in the other two patients, no voluntary behavior could be detected by means of clinical assessment. One patient was able to use our technique to answer yes or no to questions during functional MRI; however, it remained impossible to establish any form of communication at the bedside. These results show that a small proportion of patients in a vegetative or minimally conscious state have brain activation reflecting some awareness and cognition. Careful clinical examination will result in reclassification of the state of consciousness in some of these patients. This technique may be useful in establishing basic communication with patients who appear to be unresponsive. ",
pmid_21795540,Heritability of working memory brain activation.,,"Although key to understanding individual variation in task-related brain activation, the genetic contribution to these individual differences remains largely unknown. Here we report voxel-by-voxel genetic model fitting in a large sample of 319 healthy, young adult, human identical and fraternal twins (mean ± SD age, 23.6 ± 1.8 years) who performed an n-back working memory task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at a high magnetic field (4 tesla). Patterns of task-related brain response (BOLD signal difference of 2-back minus 0-back) were significantly heritable, with the highest estimates (40-65%) in the inferior, middle, and superior frontal gyri, left supplementary motor area, precentral and postcentral gyri, middle cingulate cortex, superior medial gyrus, angular gyrus, superior parietal lobule, including precuneus, and superior occipital gyri. Furthermore, high test-retest reliability for a subsample of 40 twins indicates that nongenetic variance in the fMRI brain response is largely due to unique environmental influences rather than measurement error. Individual variations in activation of the working memory network are therefore significantly influenced by genetic factors. By establishing the heritability of cognitive brain function in a large sample that affords good statistical power, and using voxel-by-voxel analyses, this study provides the necessary evidence for task-related brain activation to be considered as an endophenotype for psychiatric or neurological disorders, and represents a substantial new contribution to the field of neuroimaging genetics. These genetic brain maps should facilitate discovery of gene variants influencing cognitive brain function through genome-wide association studies, potentially opening up new avenues in the treatment of brain disorders.

Social anhedonia","Anhedonia is an important feature of major depression and schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Few neuroimaging studies have investigated neural alterations in high anhedonia, isolated from other psychopathological variables, by including only participants without clinical diagnoses. The present study examined healthy individuals scoring high (N = 18) vs. low (N = 19) in social anhedonia, who were carefully selected from a sample of N = 282 participants. To examine differences in automatic brain responses to social-affective stimuli between high vs. low social anhedonia participants, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging. To assess early, automatic stages of emotion processing, we administered a paradigm presenting brief (33ms), backward-masked happy, sad, and neutral facial expressions. Individuals high in social anhedonia demonstrated increased activation in the bilateral thalamus and left red nucleus in response to masked sad faces relative to individuals low in social anhedonia. No significant group differences in brain activation emerged in other regions known to be involved in emotion and reward processing, including the amygdala and nucleus accumbens. Our results suggest that high social anhedonia in otherwise healthy individuals is associated with exaggerated automatic reactivity in the thalamus, which is a brain structure that has been implicated in the mediation of attentional processes.

pmid_20146609,Failure to engage spatial working memory contributes to age-related declines in visuomotor learning.,,"It is well documented that both cognitive and motor learning abilities decline with normative aging. Given that cognitive processes such as working memory are engaged during the early stages of motor learning [Anguera, J., Reuter-Lorenz, P., Willingham, D., & Seidler, R. Contributions of spatial working memory to visuomotor learning. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 22(9), 1917-1930, 2010], age-related declines in motor learning may be due in part to reductions in cognitive ability. The present study examined whether age-related declines in spatial working memory (SWM) contribute to deficits in visuomotor adaptation. Young and older adult participants performed a visuomotor adaptation task that involved adapting manual aiming movements to a 30° rotation of the visual feedback display as well as an SWM task in an fMRI scanner. Young adults showed a steeper learning curve than older adults during the early adaptation period. The rate of early adaptation was correlated with SWM performance for the young, but not older, adults. Both groups showed similar brain activation patterns for the SWM task, including engagement of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral inferior parietal lobules. However, when the SWM activation was used as a limiting mask, younger adults showed neural activation that overlapped with the early adaptation period, whereas older adults did not. A partial correlation controlling for age revealed that the rate of early adaptation correlated with the amount of activation at the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that a failure to effectively engage SWM processes during learning contributes to age-related deficits in visuomotor adaptation. ",
pmid_23480966,Gray matter and white matter abnormalities in online game addiction.,,"Online game addiction (OGA) has attracted greater attention as a serious public mental health issue. However, there are only a few brain magnetic resonance imaging studies on brain structure about OGA. In the current study, we used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) to investigate the microstructural changes in OGA and assessed the relationship between these morphology changes and the Young's Internet Addiction Scale (YIAS) scores within the OGA group. Compared with healthy subjects, OGA individuals showed significant gray matter atrophy in the right orbitofrontal cortex, bilateral insula, and right supplementary motor area. According to TBSS analysis, OGA subjects had significantly reduced FA in the right genu of corpus callosum, bilateral frontal lobe white matter, and right external capsule. Gray matter volumes (GMV) of the right orbitofrontal cortex, bilateral insula and FA values of the right external capsule were significantly positively correlated with the YIAS scores in the OGA subjects. Our findings suggested that microstructure abnormalities of gray and white matter were present in OGA subjects. This finding may provide more insights into the understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms of OGA. ",
pmid_17948885,Differential contributions of the anterior temporal and medial temporal lobe to the retrieval of memory for person identity information.,,"Although previous studies have suggested the importance of the bilateral anterior temporal (ATL) and medial temporal lobes (MTL) in the retrieval of person identity information, there is little evidence concerning how these regions differentially contribute to the process. Here we investigated this question using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Before scanning, subjects learned associations among faces (F), names (N), and job titles (as a form of person-related semantics, S). During retrieval with fMRI, subjects were presented with previously learned and new S stimuli, and judged whether the stimuli were old or new. Successful retrieval (H) trials were divided into three conditions: retrieval of S and associated F and N (HSFN); retrieval of S and associated F (HSF); and retrieval of S only (HS). The left ATL was significantly activated in HSFN, compared to HSF or HS, whereas the right ATL and MTL were significantly activated in HSFN and HSF relative to HS. In addition, activity in bilateral ATL was significantly correlated with reaction time for HSFN, whereas we found no significant correlation between activity in the right MTL and reaction time in any condition. The present findings suggest that the left ATL may mediate associations between names and person-related semantic information, whereas the right ATL mediates the association between faces and person-related semantic information in memory for person identity information. In addition, activation of the right MTL region implies that this area may contribute to a more general relational processing of associative components, including memory for person identity information.

Contextual retrieval supports the disambiguation of well learned overlapping navigational routes.,,"Groundbreaking research in animals has demonstrated that the hippocampus contains neurons that distinguish between overlapping navigational trajectories. These hippocampal neurons respond selectively to the context of specific episodes despite interference from overlapping memory representations. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans to examine the role of the hippocampus and related structures when participants need to retrieve contextual information to navigate well learned spatial sequences that share common elements. Participants were trained outside the scanner to navigate through 12 virtual mazes from a ground-level first-person perspective. Six of the 12 mazes shared overlapping components. Overlapping mazes began and ended at distinct locations, but converged in the middle to share some hallways with another maze. Non-overlapping mazes did not share any hallways with any other maze. Successful navigation through the overlapping hallways required the retrieval of contextual information relevant to the current navigational episode. Results revealed greater activation during the successful navigation of the overlapping mazes compared with the non-overlapping mazes in regions typically associated with spatial and episodic memory, including the hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. When combined with previous research, the current findings suggest that an anatomically integrated system including the hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex is critical for the contextually dependent retrieval of well learned overlapping navigational routes.

Twelve IAD-afflicted and 12 normal university students participated in the study. Results show that the IAD group exhibited lower NoGo-N2 amplitude, higher NoGo-P3 amplitude, and longer NoGo-P3 peak latency than the normal group. The results also suggest that the IAD students had lower activation in the conflict detection stage than the normal group; thus, they had to engage in more cognitive endeavors to complete the inhibition task in the late stage. In addition, the IAD students showed less efficiency in information processing and lower impulse control than their normal peers. ",
pmid_20673803,Beyond revenge: neural and genetic bases of altruistic punishment.,,"It is still debated how altruistic punishment as one form of strong reciprocity has established during evolution and which motives may underlie such behavior. Recent neuroscientific evidence on the activation of brain reward regions during altruistic punishment in two-person one-shot exchange games suggests satisfaction through the punishment of norm violations as one underlying motive. In order to address this issue in more detail, we used fMRI during a one-shot economic exchange game that warrants strong reciprocity by introducing a third party punishment condition wherein revenge is unlikely to play a role. We report here that indeed, reward regions such as the nucleus accumbens showed punishment-related activation. Moreover, we provide preliminary evidence that genetic variation of dopamine turnover impacts similarly on punishment-related nucleus accumbens activation during both first person and third party punishment. The overall pattern of results suggests a common cognitive-affective-motivational network as the driving force for altruistic punishment, with only quantitative differences between first person and third party perspectives.

Working memory","Behavioral studies have demonstrated visual attention bias and working memory deficits in individuals with internet gaming disorder (IGD). Neuroimaging studies demonstrated that individuals with IGD presented abnormalities in brain structures and functions including resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) disturbance. However, most previous studies investigated IGD-related rsFC alterations by using hypothesis-driven methods with priori selection of a region of interest, which cannot provide a full picture of the rsFC changes in IGD individuals. In this study, we recruited 27 male IGD adolescents and 35 demographically matched healthy controls (HCs) to investigate abnormal connective property of each voxel within whole brain of IGD adolescents using resting-state functional connectivity density (rsFCD) method, and further to evaluate the relationship between altered rsFCD and behavioral performances of visual attention and working memory. The results exhibited no significant intergroup difference in behavioral performance (visual working memory and attention). The IGD adolescents exhibited higher global/long-range rsFCD in the bilateral dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the right inferior temporal cortex (ITC)/fusiform compared with the HCs. Although no significant correlation survived after Bonferroni correction, higher global/long-range rsFCD of the bilateral DLPFC was correlated with the Young's internet addiction test (IAT) score and/or behavioral performance in IGD adolescents using an uncorrected threshold of P < 0.05. In conclusion, IGD adolescents demonstrated increased rsFCD in the brain regions involved in working memory, spatial orientation and attention processing, which indicated that increased rsFCD may reflect a compensatory mechanism for maintaining the normal behavioral performance in IGD adolescents compared with the HCs.

pmid_17197035,"Increased left prefrontal activation in patients with unipolar depression: an event-related, parametric, performance-controlled fMRI study.",,"Executive deficits associated with frontal lobe dysfunction are prominent in depression. We applied a newly developed WM task to investigate the neural correlates of executive processes with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at comparable performance levels analyzing correct trials only. We studied 12 partially remitted, medicated inpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder and 17 healthy controls. We used a parametric version of a delayed match-to-sample WM task requiring manipulation of verbal material during a delay period in an event-related fMRI design. Depressed patients were generally slower and load-dependently less accurate than healthy controls. Patients showed significantly more activation of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with highest cognitive load. Additionally, they showed higher activation in ventromedial prefrontal cortex during the control condition. The fact that patients were taking different antidepressant drugs could limit the explanatory power of the present results. Increased lateral prefrontal activation despite comparably successful performance - when only correct trials were analyzed - in patients with depression can be interpreted as evidence for compensatory recruitment of prefrontal cortical resources.

social conformity","Changed reward functions have been proposed as a core feature of stimulant addiction, typically observed as reduced neural responses to non-drug-related rewards. However, it was unclear yet how specific this deficit is for different types of non-drug rewards arising from social and non-social reinforcements. We used functional neuroimaging in cocaine users to investigate explicit social reward as modeled by agreement of music preferences with music experts. In addition, we investigated non-social reward as modeled by winning desired music pieces. The study included 17 chronic cocaine users and 17 matched stimulant-naive healthy controls. Cocaine users, compared with controls, showed blunted neural responses to both social and non-social reward. Activation differences were located in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex overlapping for both reward types and, thus, suggesting a non-specific deficit in the processing of non-drug rewards. Interestingly, in the posterior lateral orbitofrontal cortex, social reward responses of cocaine users decreased with the degree to which they were influenced by social feedback from the experts, a response pattern that was opposite to that observed in healthy controls. The present results suggest that cocaine users likely suffer from a generalized impairment in value representation as well as from an aberrant processing of social feedback. ",

It was hypothesized that an adult ADHD diagnosis and in particular childhood symptoms, are associated with widespread changes in the brain macro- and microstructure, which can be used to develop a morphometric biomarker for ADHD. Voxel-wise linear regression models were used to examine structural and diffusion-weighted MRI data in 72 participants (31 young adults with ADHD and 41 controls without ADHD) in relation to diagnosis and the number of self-reported child and adult symptoms. Findings revealed significant associations between ADHD diagnosis and widespread changes to the maturation of white matter fiber bundles and gray matter density in the brain, such as structural shape changes (incomplete maturation) of the middle and superior temporal gyrus, and fronto-basal portions of both frontal lobes. ADHD symptoms in childhood showed the strongest association with brain macro- and microstructural abnormalities. At the brain circuitry level, the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and cortico-limbic areas are dysfunctional in individuals with ADHD. The morphometric findings predicted an ADHD diagnosis correctly up to 83% of all cases. An adult ADHD diagnosis and in particular childhood symptoms are associated with widespread micro- and macrostructural changes. The SLF and cortico-limbic findings suggest complex audio-visual, motivational, and emotional dysfunctions associated with ADHD in young adults. The sensitivity of the morphometric findings in predicting an ADHD diagnosis was sufficient, which indicates that MRI-based assessments are a promising strategy for the development of a biomarker.

pmid_23825684,Brain regions responsible for tinnitus distress and loudness: a resting-state FMRI study.,,"Subjective tinnitus is characterized by the perception of phantom sound without an external auditory stimulus. We hypothesized that abnormal functionally connected regions in the central nervous system might underlie the pathophysiology of chronic subjective tinnitus. Statistical significance of functional connectivity (FC) strength is affected by the regional autocorrelation coefficient (AC). In this study, we used resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) and measured regional mean FC strength (mean cross-correlation coefficient between a region and all other regions without taking into account the effect of AC (rGC) and with taking into account the effect of AC (rGCa) to elucidate brain regions related to tinnitus symptoms such as distress, depression and loudness. Consistent with previous studies, tinnitus loudness was not related to tinnitus-related distress and depressive state. Although both rGC and rGCa revealed similar brain regions where the values showed a statistically significant relationship with tinnitus-related symptoms, the regions for rGCa were more localized and more clearly delineated the regions related specifically to each symptom. The rGCa values in the bilateral rectus gyri were positively correlated and those in the bilateral anterior and middle cingulate gyri were negatively correlated with distress and depressive state. The rGCa values in the bilateral thalamus, the bilateral hippocampus, and the left caudate were positively correlated and those in the left medial superior frontal gyrus and the left posterior cingulate gyrus were negatively correlated with tinnitus loudness. These results suggest that distinct brain regions are responsible for tinnitus symptoms. The regions for distress and depressive state are known to be related to depression, while the regions for tinnitus loudness are known to be related to the default mode network and integration of multi-sensory information.

This phenomenon is known as the microlesion effect (MLE). However, the underlying mechanisms of MLE is poorly understood. We utilized resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) to evaluate changes in spontaneous brain activity and networks in PD patients during the microlesion period after DBS. Overall, 37 PD patients and 13 gender- and age-matched healthy controls (HCs) were recruited for this study. Rs-MRI information was collected from PD patients three days before DBS and one day after DBS, whereas the HCs group was scanned once. We utilized the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) method in order to analyze differences in spontaneous whole-brain activity among all subjects. Furthermore, functional connectivity (FC) was applied to investigate connections between other brain regions and brain areas with significantly different ALFF before and after surgery in PD patients. Relative to the PD-Pre-DBS group, the PD-Post-DBS group had higher ALFF in the right putamen, right inferior frontal gyrus, right precentral gyrus and lower ALFF in right angular gyrus, right precuneus, right posterior cingulate gyrus (PCC), left insula, left middle temporal gyrus (MTG), bilateral middle frontal gyrus and bilateral superior frontal gyrus (dorsolateral). Functional connectivity analysis revealed that these brain regions with significantly different ALFF scores demonstrated abnormal FC, largely in the temporal, prefrontal cortices and default mode network (DMN). The subthalamic microlesion caused by DBS in PD was found to not only improve the activity of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit, but also reduce the activity of the DMN and executive control network (ECN) related brain regions. Results from this study provide new insights into the mechanism of MLE. ",

However, the detailed mechanisms underlying its effects are not well understood. Positron emission tomography (PET) with H(2)(15)O was applied to clarify these mechanisms. Nine patients with intractable neuropathic pain in the lower limbs were included in the study. All patients underwent SCS therapy for intractable pain, which was due to failed back surgery syndrome in three patients, complex regional pain syndrome in two, cerebral hemorrhage in two, spinal infarction in one, and spinal cord injury in one. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured by H(2)(15)O PET before and after SCS. The images were analyzed with statistical parametric mapping software (SPM2). SCS reduced pain; visual analog scale values for pain decreased from 76.1+/-25.2 before SCS to 40.6+/-4.5 after SCS (mean+/-SE). Significant rCBF increases were identified after SCS in the thalamus contralateral to the painful limb and in the bilateral parietal association area. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and prefrontal areas were also activated after SCS. These results suggest that SCS modulates supraspinal neuronal activities. The contralateral thalamus and parietal association area would regulate the pain threshold. The ACC and prefrontal areas would control the emotional aspects of intractable pain, resulting in the reduction of neuropathic pain after SCS. ",
pmid_19321780,The neurobiology of reference-dependent value computation.,,"A key focus of current research in neuroeconomics concerns how the human brain computes value. Although, value has generally been viewed as an absolute measure (e.g., expected value, reward magnitude), much evidence suggests that value is more often computed with respect to a changing reference point, rather than in isolation. Here, we present the results of a study aimed to dissociate brain regions involved in reference-independent (i.e., ""absolute"") value computations, from those involved in value computations relative to a reference point. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, subjects acted as buyers and sellers during a market exchange of lottery tickets. At a behavioral level, we demonstrate that subjects systematically accorded a higher value to objects they owned relative to those they did not, an effect that results from a shift in reference point (i.e., status quo bias or endowment effect). Our results show that activity in orbitofrontal cortex and dorsal striatum track parameters such as the expected value of lottery tickets indicating the computation of reference-independent value. In contrast, activity in ventral striatum indexed the degree to which stated prices, at a within-subjects and between-subjects level, were distorted with respect to a reference point. The findings speak to the neurobiological underpinnings of reference dependency during real market value computations. ",

Neuroimaging techniques have proven to be potentially useful to unravel the shared features of these syndromes. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI), we investigated functional connectivity of brain networks in 15 ALS and 15 bvFTD patients in early stages of disease and 15 healthy controls, looking expressly for connectivity pattern divergence or overlap between the 2 disorders. Compared with controls, we found decreased RS-fMRI signals within sensorimotor, right frontoparietal, salience, and executive networks in both patient groups. Within the default mode network (DMN), divergent connectivity patterns were observed, with RS-fMRI signals in the posterior cingulate cortex enhanced in bvFTD patients and suppressed in ALS patients. Our findings confirm that ALS and bvFTD not only broadly share common RS-fMRI connectivity patterns, probably representing different phenotypical expressions of the same neurodegenerative process, but also differ in the DMN, probably reflecting a different stage of neurodegeneration.

Abnormal functional connectivity of the amygdala with various cortical and subcortical areas has been observed in major depressive disorder, indicating that dysfunction of the corticolimbic network may be involved in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder. However, little is known about alterations of amygdala functional connectivity in depressed PD patients. In the present study, 20 depressed PD patients, 40 nondepressed PD patients, and 43 matched healthy controls underwent neuropsychological tests and resting-state functional MRI scanning. Between-group differences in amygdala functional connectivity network were examined using t tests. Compared to the nondepressed PD patients, depressed PD patients showed increased left amygdala functional connectivity with the bilateral mediodorsal thalamus, right amygdala functional connectivity with the left superior temporal gyrus, and left calcarine gyrus. Compared to the healthy controls, the depressed PD group also showed increased left amygdala functional connectivity with the bilateral mediodorsal thalamus, but decreased left amygdala functional connectivity with the left putamen, left inferior frontal gyrus, and the right cerebellum, as well as decreased right amygdala functional connectivity with the left inferior orbitofrontal gyrus, the left gyrus rectus, and the right putamen. The increased connectivity between limbic regions and decreased connectivity between the corticolimbic networks may reflect impaired high-order cortical regulatory effects on the emotion-related limbic areas, which may lead to mood dysregulation. Our study should advance the understanding of neural mechanisms underlying depression in PD. ",
pmid_17291784,Dysfunction of reward processing correlates with alcohol craving in detoxified alcoholics.,,"Alcohol dependence may be associated with dysfunction of mesolimbic circuitry, such that anticipation of nonalcoholic reward fails to activate the ventral striatum, while alcohol-associated cues continue to activate this region. This may lead alcoholics to crave the pharmacological effects of alcohol to a greater extent than other conventional rewards. The present study investigated neural mechanisms underlying these phenomena. 16 detoxified male alcoholics and 16 age-matched healthy volunteers participated in two fMRI paradigms. In the first paradigm, alcohol-associated and affectively neutral pictures were presented, whereas in the second paradigm, a monetary incentive delay task (MID) was performed, in which brain activation during anticipation of monetary gain and loss was examined. For both paradigms, we assessed the association of alcohol craving with neural activation to incentive cues. Detoxified alcoholics showed reduced activation of the ventral striatum during anticipation of monetary gain relative to healthy controls, despite similar performance. However, alcoholics showed increased ventral striatal activation in response to alcohol-associated cues. Reduced activation in the ventral striatum during expectation of monetary reward, and increased activation during presentation of alcohol cues were correlated with alcohol craving in alcoholics, but not healthy controls. These results suggest that mesolimbic activation in alcoholics is biased towards processing of alcohol cues. This might explain why alcoholics find it particularly difficult to focus on conventional reward cues and engage in alternative rewarding activities. ",

Psychotherapy","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with dysfunction of the emotional circuitry in the brain. Psychotherapy and antidepressant treatment both aid in modulating this dysfunction, albeit probably through different mechanisms. A plausible ""top-down"" emotional regulation mechanism for psychotherapy has been described in previous studies, but the underlying findings are still contradictory. A total of 23 MDD patients and 20 healthy controls were enrolled. The early neural effects within 5 weeks of guided imagery-a psychotherapeutic method for treating depression-were assessed through resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging using the regional homogeneity analytical method. At baseline, regional homogeneity was reduced in cortical regions and increased in limbic areas in the pre-treatment scans of MDD patients as compared to controls. After 5 weeks of guided imagery therapy, regional homogeneity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate gyrus both increased. Higher pre-treatment regional homogeneity in the dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus was positively correlated with an improved response to guided imagery therapy. The changes in regional homogeneity induced by guided imagery therapy demonstrate that this method of psychotherapy takes effect through a ""top-down"" mechanism. Future studies comparing various psychotherapeutic methodologies across multiple time points in the treatment course should yield more valuable insights on this topic. ",

pmid_28340213,Effects of Alcohol Dependence Severity on Neural Correlates of Delay Discounting.,,"The current study examines the relationship between alcohol dependence severity and delay discounting neural activation. Participants (N = 17; 6 female) completed measures of alcohol use and severity and a functional magnetic resonance imaging version of a delay discounting task. Alcohol dependence severity was negatively associated with activation in superior frontal gyrus during impulsive relative to delayed decisions, and positively associated with activation in paracingulate gyrus and frontal pole in delayed relative to impulsive decisions. These results indicate that alcohol dependence severity tracks closely with dysregulations in cognitive control and reward evaluation areas during impulsive and delayed decisions, respectively. Delay discounting may be a useful construct in capturing these cognitive dysregulations as alcohol use disorders become more severe. Among alcohol-dependent individuals, alcohol dependence severity is associated with overactivation of ventromedial prefrontal areas during delayed and underactivation of dorsolateral prefrontal regions during impulsive reward decisions.

The objective of this study was to explore brain functional changes in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) by measuring the amplitude of the BOLD signals. Eighteen amnestic MCI patients and 20 healthy elderly individuals underwent the fMRI scan. The amplitude of LFF (ALFF) was calculated using REST software. MCI patients showed decreased ALFF in the right hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex, left lateral temporal cortex and right ventral medial prefrontal cortex and increased ALFF in the left temporal-parietal joint (TPJ) and inferior parietal lobule. The ALFF value in the right hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex was positively correlated with the scores of Mini-Mental State Exam. Reduced medial temporal lobe activity may implicate the underlying memory impairment mechanisms in MCI. Increased TPJ and inferior parietal lobule activity may indicate the compensatory mechanism in MCI patients. These findings suggest that ALFF analysis could provide a useful tool in the fMRI study of MCI. ",
pmid_16919409,Altered baseline brain activity in children with ADHD revealed by resting-state functional MRI.,,"In children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), functional neuroimaging studies have revealed abnormalities in various brain regions, including prefrontal-striatal circuit, cerebellum, and brainstem. In the current study, we used a new marker of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), amplitude of low-frequency (0.01-0.08Hz) fluctuation (ALFF) to investigate the baseline brain function of this disorder. Thirteen boys with ADHD (13.0+/-1.4 years) were examined by resting-state fMRI and compared with age-matched controls. As a result, we found that patients with ADHD had decreased ALFF in the right inferior frontal cortex, [corrected] and bilateral cerebellum and the vermis as well as increased ALFF in the right anterior cingulated cortex, left sensorimotor cortex, and bilateral brainstem. This resting-state fMRI study suggests that the changed spontaneous neuronal activity of these regions may be implicated in the underlying pathophysiology in children with ADHD. ",

voxel-based morphometry","Making healthy food choices is challenging for many people. Individuals differ greatly in their ability to follow health goals in the face of temptation, but it is unclear what underlies such differences. Using voxel-based morphometry, we investigated in healthy humans (i.e., men and women) the links between structural variation in gray matter volume and individuals' level of success in shifting toward healthier food choices. We combined MRI and choice data into a joint dataset by pooling across three independent studies that used a task prompting participants to explicitly focus on the healthiness of food items before making their food choices. Within this dataset, we found that individual differences in gray matter volume in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) predicted regulatory success. We extended and confirmed these initial findings by predicting regulatory success out of sample and across tasks in a second dataset requiring participants to apply a different regulation strategy that entailed distancing from cravings for unhealthy, appetitive foods. Our findings suggest that neuroanatomical markers in the vmPFC and dlPFC generalized to different forms of dietary regulation strategies across participant groups. They provide novel evidence that structural differences in neuroanatomy of two key regions for valuation and its control, the vmPFC and dlPFC, predict an individual's ability to exert control in dietary choices.

pmid_20005675,Neural correlates of reward processing in schizophrenia--relationship to apathy and depression.,,"The present study employs a new framework to categorise the heterogeneous findings on the relationship between impaired reward processing and negative and affective symptoms of schizophrenia. Based on previous behavioural and neuroimaging studies we postulate that ""wanting"" (i.e. anticipation) of a reward is specifically related to apathy, whereas ""liking"" (i.e. hedonic impact) is related to anhedonia and depression--symptoms commonly observed in schizophrenia. Fifteen patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs and fifteen healthy controls performed a probabilistic monetary incentive delay task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. At the group level we found no significant differences between patients and controls in neural activation during anticipation or receipt of a reward. However, in patients with schizophrenia specific relationships between ventral-striatal activation and symptoms were observed. Ventral-striatal activation during reward anticipation was negatively correlated with apathy, while activation during receipt of reward was negatively correlated with severity of depressive symptoms. These results suggest that the link between negative symptoms and reward anticipation might specifically relate to apathy, i.e. a lack of motivation and drive. Impaired hedonic reward processing might contribute to the development of depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, but it is not directly associated with self-rated anhedonia. These results indicate the necessity of more specifically differentiating negative and affective symptoms in schizophrenia in order to understand the role of the reward system in their pathogenesis. ",
pmid_19508693,Role of the basal ganglia in switching a planned response.,,"The ability to perform an appropriate response in the presence of competing alternatives is a critical facet of human behavioral control. This is especially important if a response is prepared for execution but then has to be changed suddenly. A popular hypothesis of basal ganglia (BG) function suggests that its direct and indirect pathways could provide a neural mechanism to rapidly switch from one planned response to an alternative. However, if one response is more dominant or 'automatic' than the other, the BG might have a different role depending on switch direction. We built upon the pro- and antisaccade tasks, two models of automatic and voluntary behavior, respectively, and investigated whether the BG are important for switching any planned response in general, or if they are more important for switching from a more automatic response to a response that is more difficult to perform. Subjects prepared either a pro- or antisaccade but then had to switch it unexpectedly on a subset of trials. The results revealed increased striatal activation for switching from a pro- to an antisaccade but this did not occur for switching from an anti- to a prosaccade. This activation pattern depended on the relative difficulty in switching, and it was distinct from frontal eye fields, an area shown to be more active for antisaccade trials than for prosaccade trials. This suggests that the BG are important for compensating for differences in response difficulty, facilitating the rapid switching of one response for another. ",

Altered activity in addiction-related brain regions has been found during cue-reactivity in IGD using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), but less is known regarding the alterations of coordinated whole brain activity patterns in IGD. To investigate the activity of temporally coherent, large-scale functional brain networks (FNs) during cue-reactivity in IGD, independent component analysis was applied to fMRI data from 29 male subjects with IGD and 23 matched healthy controls (HC) performing a cue-reactivity task involving Internet gaming stimuli (i.e., game cues) and general Internet surfing-related stimuli (i.e., control cues). Four FNs were identified that were related to the response to game cues relative to control cues and that showed altered engagement/disengagement in IGD compared with HC. These FNs included temporo-occipital and temporo-insula networks associated with sensory processing, a frontoparietal network involved in memory and executive functioning, and a dorsal-limbic network implicated in reward and motivation processing. Within IGD, game versus control engagement of the temporo-occipital and frontoparietal networks were positively correlated with IGD severity. Similarly, disengagement of temporo-insula network was negatively correlated with higher game-craving. These findings are consistent with altered cue-reactivity brain regions reported in substance-related addictions, providing evidence that IGD may represent a type of addiction. The identification of the networks might shed light on the mechanisms of the cue-induced craving and addictive Internet gaming behaviors. ",

The aim of this study was to characterize longitudinal changes in brain activity between repeated observations within a short time interval in a group of female migraine patients, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Nineteen patients and 20 healthy controls (HC) participated in the study. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional interregional connectivity were assessed to determine the focal and global features of brain dysfunction in migraine. The relationship between changes in headache parameters and longitudinal brain alterations were also investigated. All patients reported that their headache activity increased over time. Abnormal ReHo changes in the patient group relative to the HC were found in the putamen, orbitofrontal cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex, brainstem, and thalamus. Moreover, these brain regions exhibited longitudinal ReHo changes at the 6-week follow-up examination. These headache activity changes were accompanied by disproportionately dysfunctional connectivity in the putamen in the migraine patients, as revealed by functional connectivity analysis, suggesting that the putamen plays an important role in integrating diverse information among other migraine-related brain regions. The results obtained in this study suggest that progressive brain aberrations in migraine progress as a result of increased headache attacks. ",
pmid_26741799,Intensive Working Memory Training Produces Functional Changes in Large-scale Frontoparietal Networks.,,"Working memory is central to human cognition, and intensive cognitive training has been shown to expand working memory capacity in a given domain. It remains unknown, however, how the neural systems that support working memory are altered through intensive training to enable the expansion of working memory capacity. We used fMRI to measure plasticity in activations associated with complex working memory before and after 20 days of training. Healthy young adults were randomly assigned to train on either a dual n-back working memory task or a demanding visuospatial attention task. Training resulted in substantial and task-specific expansion of dual n-back abilities accompanied by changes in the relationship between working memory load and activation. Training differentially affected activations in two large-scale frontoparietal networks thought to underlie working memory: the executive control network and the dorsal attention network. Activations in both networks linearly scaled with working memory load before training, but training dissociated the role of the two networks and eliminated this relationship in the executive control network. Load-dependent functional connectivity both within and between these two networks increased following training, and the magnitudes of increased connectivity were positively correlated with improvements in task performance. These results provide insight into the adaptive neural systems that underlie large gains in working memory capacity through training. ",
pmid_21205806,Prefrontal cortical deficits and impaired cognition-emotion interactions in schizophrenia.,,"Despite schizophrenia patients' reports of diminished experience of emotion in interviews and self-report measures, their emotional experience in the presence of emotional stimuli and in daily life (""in the moment"") appears largely intact. To examine emotion-cognition interactions, the authors tested the hypothesis that schizophrenia patients have unimpaired in-the-moment emotional reactivity but have a deficit in prefrontal cortical mechanisms needed to maintain and report on experience following exposure to emotional stimuli. Using a slow event-related functional MRI paradigm, the authors examined the brain activity of 23 schizophrenia patients and 24 healthy comparison subjects during trials in which they viewed an affective picture and, after a delay, reported their emotional experience while viewing it. The patients' self-reports of emotional experience differed from those of the healthy subjects when they rated their experience on dimensions inconsistent with the stimulus valence but not when the dimension was consistent with it. In the presence of emotional stimuli, brain activity in the patients was similar to that of the comparison subjects. During the delay, however, patients showed decreased activation in a network of brain structures, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and other prefrontal, limbic, and paralimbic areas. In patients, the delay-related response of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to pleasant stimuli correlated negatively with an anhedonia measure. These results suggest that schizophrenia is characterized by a failure of prefrontal circuitry supporting the link between emotion and goal-directed behavior and that the failure of this mechanism may contribute to deficits in processes related to emotion-cognition interaction.

pmid_25938917,Functional MRI reveals different response inhibition between adults and children with ADHD.,,"Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been recognized as a disorder of executive function, and a number of functional MRI (fMRI) studies have been conducted to investigate the altered brain activation patterns between ADHD patients and healthy controls. However, the findings across different studies have been inconsistent, and the different neural mechanisms between adults and children with ADHD remain unclear. The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of fMRI studies to further investigate and compare the abnormalities in adults and children with ADHD during motor response inhibition. Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) was used to investigate brain activation differences between ADHD patients and controls, and a subtraction meta-analysis was performed to compare adult and child patients. Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis using ALE detected significantly decreased activation during response inhibition in ADHD in the supplementary motor area, insula, caudate, and precentral gyrus, as well as increased activation in the postcentral gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, and precuneus. The activation decreases in the right caudate were greater in child ADHD patients than adult ADHD patients. This meta-analysis identified dysfunction in several areas of the motor inhibition network that may play a role in the abnormal neural mechanisms of response inhibition in ADHD. The comparison of child and adult subgroups raises the possibility that the persistence of functional abnormalities of the caudate may be an important factor in whether ADHD persists. ",
pmid_17553986,Where am I now? Distinct roles for parahippocampal and retrosplenial cortices in place recognition.,,"A key component of spatial navigation is the ability to use visual information to ascertain where one is located and how one is oriented in the world. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the neural correlates of this phenomenon in humans. Subjects were scanned while retrieving different kinds of topographical and nontopographical information in response to visual scenes. In the three critical conditions, they viewed images of a familiar college campus, and reported either the location of the place depicted in the image (location task), the compass direction that the camera was facing when the image was taken (orientation task), or whether the location was on campus or not (familiarity task). Our analyses focused on the retrosplenial cortex (RSC)/parietal-occipital sulcus region and the parahippocampal place area (PPA), which previous studies indicate play a critical role in place recognition. RSC activity depended on the type of information retrieved, with the strongest response in the location task. In contrast, PPA activity did not depend on the retrieval task. Additional analyses revealed a strong effect of familiarity in RSC but not in the PPA, with the former region responding much more strongly to images of the familiar campus than to images of an unfamiliar campus. These results suggest that the PPA and RSC play distinct but complementary roles in place recognition. In particular, the PPA may primarily support perception of the immediate scene, whereas RSC may support memory retrieval mechanisms that allow the scene to be localized within the broader spatial environment.

Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
Go/NoGo task
Superior parietal lobe","We evaluated neural substrates related to the loss of control in college students with internet gaming disorder (IGD). We hypothesized that deficit in response inhibition under gaming cue distraction was the possible mechanism for the loss of control internet use. Eleven cases of IGD and 11 controls performed Go/NoGo tasks with/without gaming distraction in the functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner. When the gaming picture was shown as background while individuals were performing Go/NoGo tasks, the IGD group committed more commission errors. The control group increased their brain activations more over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and superior parietal lobe under gaming cue distraction in comparison with the IGD group. Furthermore, brain activation of the right DLPFC and superior parietal lobe were negatively associated with performance of response inhibition among the IGD group. The results suggest that the function of response inhibition was impaired under gaming distraction among the IGD group, and individuals with IGD could not activate right DLPFC and superior parietal lobe to keep cognitive control and attention allocation for response inhibition under gaming cue distraction. This mechanism should be addressed in any intervention for IGD. ",

In total, 35 patients with DR (18 males and 17 females) and 38 healthy control (HC) subjects (18 males and 20 females) were enrolled in this study. All participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scanning, respectively. The ALFF method was used to assess the spontaneous brain activity, while the mean ALFF signal values of patients with DR and HCs were classified by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Correlation analysis was performed to calculate the relationship between the observed mean ALFF values of the altered regions in patients with DR and their clinical features. Compared with the HCs, patients with DR had significantly lower ALFF values in the left and right middle occipital gyrus (MOG). In contrast, patients with DR showed higher ALFF values in the left cerebellum (CER), left inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) and left hippocampus (Hipp). However, no relationship was observed between the mean ALFF signal values of the altered regions and clinical manifestations in the patients with DR. We mainly found that patients with DR showed abnormal intrinsic brain activities in the left and right MOG, left CER, left ITG and left Hipp, which might provide useful information for explaining neural mechanisms in patients with DR.

pmid_24100929,Altered emotion processing circuits during the anticipation of emotional stimuli in women with borderline personality disorder.,,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is associated with disturbed emotion processing, typically encompassing intense and fast emotional reactions toward affective stimuli. In this study, we were interested in whether emotional dysregulation in BPD occurs not only during the perception of emotional stimuli, but also during the anticipation of upcoming emotional pictures in the absence of concrete stimuli. Eighteen female patients with a diagnosis of BPD and 18 healthy control subjects anticipated cued visual stimuli with prior known emotional valence or prior unknown emotional content during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Brain activity during the anticipation of emotional stimuli was compared between both groups. When anticipating negative pictures, BPD patients demonstrated less signal change in the left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and left middle cingulate cortex (MCC), and enhanced activations in the left pregenual ACC, left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) as well as in left visual cortical areas including the lingual gyrus. During the anticipation of ambiguously announced stimuli, brain activity in BPD was also reduced in the left MCC extending into the medial and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Results point out that deficient recruitment of brain areas related to cognitive-emotional interaction already during the anticipation phase may add to emotional dysregulation in BPD. Stronger activation of the PCC could correspond to an increased autobiographical reference in BPD. Moreover, increased preparatory visual activity during negative anticipation may contribute to hypersensitivity toward emotional cues in this disorder. ",
pmid_15056518,Anterior cingulate cortex activation during cognitive interference in schizophrenia.,,"Previous studies have reported evidence of structural and functional abnormalities in the anterior cingulate cortex of patients with schizophrenia. The authors studied 19 male patients with chronic schizophrenia and 15 healthy male comparison subjects with functional magnetic resonance imaging and the novel Multi-Source Interference Task, a task designed to elicit robust dorsal anterior cingulate cortex activation in individual subjects. Group averaged and individual (region-of-interest-based) brain activation patterns were compared during the performance of control and interference trials. Performance (reaction times and accuracy) did not differ between healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia. Comparison of interference and neutral blocks revealed activation in the medial wall of the prefrontal cortex in 93% (N=14) of the healthy subjects and 84% (N=16) of the subjects with schizophrenia. Sixty-seven percent (N=10) of the healthy subjects but only 16% (N=3) of the subjects with schizophrenia displayed maximum medial wall activation within the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. The Multi-Source Interference Task produced robust activation in the medial wall of the prefrontal cortex during cognitive interference. Analysis of individual activation patterns revealed medial wall abnormalities in schizophrenia patients. ",

Given the importance of social integration for aging and documented social decrements in cocaine users, we examined social function and its neurocognitive substrates in aging cocaine users relative to carefully matched non-cocaine users. Regular (≥twice/week), long-term (≥15 years) cocaine smokers 50-60 years old (COCs; n = 22; four women) and controls (CTRLs; n = 19; four women) underwent standardized probes of social reward and threat processing during functional magnetic resonance imaging and a behavioral facial affect recognition task. Self-report and peer-report of daily interpersonal function were also collected. COCs, and CTRLs reporting current marijuana or alcohol use, were tested after four drug-free inpatient days. COCs had pronounced problems in daily social function relative to CTRLs indicated by both their own and their peers' reports. Compared with CTRLs, COCs had stronger amygdala responses to social threat versus control stimuli, with no other differences in social processing or cognition. Aging cocaine users appear to have marked, generalized difficulties in 'real-world' interpersonal function but largely intact social processing on laboratory-based measures when compared with appropriately matched controls and tested under well-controlled conditions. Daily social difficulties may be related to transient factors such as acute/residual drug effects or cocaine-related changes in health behaviors (e.g. disrupted sleep and poor diet). These data suggest that interpersonal function may be a valid intervention target for aging cocaine users and warrants further study in older drug users. ",
pmid_32251354,Locating neural transfer effects of n-back training on the central executive: a longitudinal fMRI study.,,"The large number of behavioral studies testing whether working memory training improves performance on an untrained task have yielded inconclusive results. Moreover, some studies have investigated the possible neural changes during the performance of untrained tasks after training. Here, we studied the transfer from n-back training to the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), two different tasks that use the central executive system to maintain verbal stimuli. Participants completed fMRI sessions at baseline, immediately after one week of training, and at the five-week follow-up. Although behavioral transfer effects were not obtained, training was associated with decreased activation in the anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; BA 9/46) while performing the PASAT that remained stable five weeks later. Consistent with our hypothesis, the changes in the anterior DLFPC largely overlapped with the n-back task fMRI activations. In conclusion, working memory training improves efficiency in brain areas involved in the trained task that may affect untrained tasks, specifically in brain areas responsible for the same cognitive processes.

pmid_21128080,Patterns of cortical activity differ in ALS patients with limb and/or bulbar involvement depending on motor tasks.,,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of hand movements in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has repeatedly demonstrated increased activation in cortical and subcortical areas, whereas a single study has suggested decreased rather than increased activations for tongue movements in patients with bulbar involvement. This points to differences in the pathophysiology and may correspond to the different time-course of disease for patients with and without bulbar involvement. We, therefore, compared the cortical activity during movements of the tongue and right hand using fMRI to delineate the neurofunctional correlates of bulbar versus limb symptoms in 20 ALS patients (11 with bulbar signs) and age-matched controls. During vertical tongue movements, the cortical activation pattern in ALS patients without bulbar signs did not differ from the control group. However, presence of bulbar signs caused a significant decrease of cortical activation. An increased cortical activity during the hand movement in all ALS patients was evident, regardless of site of onset and presence of bulbar signs. Thus, two different patterns of cortical activation changes suggesting fundamental differences in the neurodegenerative process and subsequent reorganisation processes exist for limb and bulbar movements.

However, it is still poorly understood how the anterior insula is involved in anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN), which are characterized by opposite motivational responses to food. We applied a cue-reactivity paradigm using blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging in women with AN (N=18) and BN (N=20) and age-matched healthy controls (N=20). We defined the left anterior insula as a region-of-interest and performed seed-based functional connectivity and effective connectivity MRI analysis. In response to food images compared to non-food images, both the AN group and BN group demonstrated increased activity in the left anterior insula. In the AN group, the left anterior insula demonstrated significant interactions with the right insula and right inferior frontal gyrus. In the BN group, the left anterior insula demonstrated significant interactions with the medial orbitofrontal cortex. The distinct patterns of functional and effective connectivity of the anterior insula may contribute to the different clinical features of AN and BN. ",

unipolar depression","Depression in bipolar disorder (BipD) requires a therapeutic approach that is from treating unipolar major depressive disorder (UniD), but to date, no reliable methods could separate these two disorders. The aim of this study was to establish the clinical validity and utility of a non-invasive functional MRI-based method to classify BipD from UniD. The degree of connectivity (degree centrality or DC) of every small unit (voxel) with every other unit of the brain was estimated in 22 patients with BipD and 22 age, gender, and depressive severity-matched patients with UniD and 22 healthy controls. Pattern classification analysis was carried out using a support-vector machine (SVM) approach. Degree centrality pattern from 8-min resting fMRI discriminated BipD from UniD with an accuracy of 86% and diagnostic odds ratio of 9.6. DC was reduced in the left insula and increased in bilateral precuneus in BipD when compared to UniD. In this sample with a high degree of uncertainty (50% prior probability), positive predictive value of the DC test was 79%. Degree centrality maps are potential candidate measures to separate bipolar depression from unipolar depression. Test performance reported here requires further pragmatic evaluation in regular clinical practice. ",

Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), one of the most widely used mindfulness training programs, has been reported to produce positive effects on psychological well-being and to ameliorate symptoms of a number of disorders. Here, we report a controlled longitudinal study to investigate pre-post changes in brain gray matter concentration attributable to participation in an MBSR program. Anatomical magnetic resonance (MR) images from 16 healthy, meditation-naïve participants were obtained before and after they underwent the 8-week program. Changes in gray matter concentration were investigated using voxel-based morphometry, and compared with a waiting list control group of 17 individuals. Analyses in a priori regions of interest confirmed increases in gray matter concentration within the left hippocampus. Whole brain analyses identified increases in the posterior cingulate cortex, the temporo-parietal junction, and the cerebellum in the MBSR group compared with the controls. The results suggest that participation in MBSR is associated with changes in gray matter concentration in brain regions involved in learning and memory processes, emotion regulation, self-referential processing, and perspective taking.

pmid_23516294,Training the emotional brain: improving affective control through emotional working memory training.,,"Affective cognitive control capacity (e.g., the ability to regulate emotions or manipulate emotional material in the service of task goals) is associated with professional and interpersonal success. Impoverished affective control, by contrast, characterizes many neuropsychiatric disorders. Insights from neuroscience indicate that affective cognitive control relies on the same frontoparietal neural circuitry as working memory (WM) tasks, which suggests that systematic WM training, performed in an emotional context, has the potential to augment affective control. Here we show, using behavioral and fMRI measures, that 20 d of training on a novel emotional WM protocol successfully enhanced the efficiency of this frontoparietal demand network. Critically, compared with placebo training, emotional WM training also accrued transfer benefits to a ""gold standard"" measure of affective cognitive control-emotion regulation. These emotion regulation gains were associated with greater activity in the targeted frontoparietal demand network along with other brain regions implicated in affective control, notably the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. The results have important implications for the utility of WM training in clinical, prevention, and occupational settings. ",
pmid_15850740,Hippocampal activations during encoding and retrieval in a verbal working memory paradigm.,,"Though the hippocampus has been associated with encoding and retrieval processes in episodic memory, the precise nature of its involvement in working memory has yet to be determined. This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study employed a verbal working memory paradigm that allows for the within-subject comparison of functional activations during encoding, maintenance, and retrieval. In each trial, participants were shown 5 target words and, after an 8 s delay, a series of probe words. Probe words consisted of target matches, phonetically or semantically related foils, or foils unrelated to the target words. Both the left and right hippocampi showed higher mean activation amplitudes during encoding than maintenance. In contrast, the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) showed greater activation during maintenance than encoding. Both hippocampal and DLPFC regions were more active during retrieval than maintenance. Furthermore, an analysis of retrieval activation separated by probe type showed a trend toward greater bilateral hippocampal activation for probes related (both semantically and phonetically) to the target than for unrelated probes and still greater activation for target matches. This pattern suggests that there may be roles for the hippocampus and DLPFC in working memory that change as function of information processing stage. Additionally, the trend towards increased involvement of the hippocampus with the increase in relatedness of the probe stimuli to the information maintained is interpreted to be consistent with the role of the hippocampus in recollection-based retrieval in long-term memory and may indicate that this role extends to working memory processes.

Evidence-based decision making for health at the province level in China, which is home to a fifth of the global population, is of paramount importance. This analysis uses data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 to help inform decision making and monitor progress on health at the province level. We used the methods in GBD 2017 to analyse health patterns in the 34 province-level administrative units in China from 1990 to 2017. We estimated all-cause and cause-specific mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), summary exposure values (SEVs), and attributable risk. We compared the observed results with expected values estimated based on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI). Stroke and ischaemic heart disease were the leading causes of death and DALYs at the national level in China in 2017. Age-standardised DALYs per 100 000 population decreased by 33·1% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 29·8 to 37·4) for stroke and increased by 4·6% (-3·3 to 10·7) for ischaemic heart disease from 1990 to 2017. Age-standardised stroke, ischaemic heart disease, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and liver cancer were the five leading causes of YLLs in 2017. Musculoskeletal disorders, mental health disorders, and sense organ diseases were the three leading causes of YLDs in 2017, and high systolic blood pressure, smoking, high-sodium diet, and ambient particulate matter pollution were among the leading four risk factors contributing to deaths and DALYs. All provinces had higher than expected DALYs per 100 000 population for liver cancer, with the observed to expected ratio ranging from 2·04 to 6·88. The all-cause age-standardised DALYs per 100 000 population were lower than expected in all provinces in 2017, and among the top 20 level 3 causes were lower than expected for ischaemic heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, headache disorder, and low back pain. The largest percentage change at the national level in age-standardised SEVs among the top ten leading risk factors was in high body-mass index (185%, 95% UI 113·1 to 247·7]), followed by ambient particulate matter pollution (88·5%, 66·4 to 116·4).

fMRI","The development of social emotions such as compassion is crucial for successful social interactions as well as for the maintenance of mental and physical health, especially when confronted with distressing life events. Yet, the neural mechanisms supporting the training of these emotions are poorly understood. To study affective plasticity in healthy adults, we measured functional neural and subjective responses to witnessing the distress of others in a newly developed task (Socio-affective Video Task). Participants' initial empathic responses to the task were accompanied by negative affect and activations in the anterior insula and anterior medial cingulate cortex--a core neural network underlying empathy for pain. Whereas participants reacted with negative affect before training, compassion training increased positive affective experiences, even in response to witnessing others in distress. On the neural level, we observed that, compared with a memory control group, compassion training elicited activity in a neural network including the medial orbitofrontal cortex, putamen, pallidum, and ventral tegmental area--brain regions previously associated with positive affect and affiliation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the deliberate cultivation of compassion offers a new coping strategy that fosters positive affect even when confronted with the distress of others. ",
pmid_23574118,An fMRI-based neurologic signature of physical pain.,,"Persistent pain is measured by means of self-report, the sole reliance on which hampers diagnosis and treatment. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) holds promise for identifying objective measures of pain, but brain measures that are sensitive and specific to physical pain have not yet been identified. In four studies involving a total of 114 participants, we developed an fMRI-based measure that predicts pain intensity at the level of the individual person. In study 1, we used machine-learning analyses to identify a pattern of fMRI activity across brain regions--a neurologic signature--that was associated with heat-induced pain. The pattern included the thalamus, the posterior and anterior insulae, the secondary somatosensory cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the periaqueductal gray matter, and other regions. In study 2, we tested the sensitivity and specificity of the signature to pain versus warmth in a new sample. In study 3, we assessed specificity relative to social pain, which activates many of the same brain regions as physical pain. In study 4, we assessed the responsiveness of the measure to the analgesic agent remifentanil. In study 1, the neurologic signature showed sensitivity and specificity of 94% or more (95% confidence interval [CI], 89 to 98) in discriminating painful heat from nonpainful warmth, pain anticipation, and pain recall. In study 2, the signature discriminated between painful heat and nonpainful warmth with 93% sensitivity and specificity (95% CI, 84 to 100). In study 3, it discriminated between physical pain and social pain with 85% sensitivity (95% CI, 76 to 94) and 73% specificity (95% CI, 61 to 84) and with 95% sensitivity and specificity in a forced-choice test of which of two conditions was more painful. In study 4, the strength of the signature response was substantially reduced when remifentanil was administered. It is possible to use fMRI to assess pain elicited by noxious heat in healthy persons. Future studies are needed to assess whether the signature predicts clinical pain. (Funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and others.). ",
pmid_18303983,Cortical differentiation for nouns and verbs depends on grammatical markers.,,"Here we address the contentious issue of how nouns and verbs are represented in the brain. The co-occurrence of noun and verb deficits with damage to different neural regions has led to the view that they are differentially represented in the brain. Recent neuroimaging evidence and inconsistent lesion-behavior associations challenge this view. We have suggested that nouns and verbs are not differentially represented in the brain, but that different patterns of neural activity are triggered by the different linguistic functions carried by nouns and verbs. We test these claims in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study using homophones -- words which function grammatically as nouns or verbs but have the same form and meaning -- ensuring that any neural differences reflect differences in grammatical function. Words were presented as single stems and in phrases in which each homophone was preceded by an article to create a noun phrase (NP) or a pronoun to create a verb phrase (VP), thus establishing the word's functional linguistic role. Activity for single-word homophones was not modulated by their frequency of usage as a noun or verb. In contrast, homophones marked as verbs by appearing in VPs elicited greater activity in the left posterior middle temporal gyrus (LpMTG) compared to homophones marked as nouns by occurring in NPs. Neuropsychological patients with grammatical deficits had lesions which overlapped with the greater LpMTG activity found for VPs. These results suggest that nouns and verbs do not invariably activate different neural regions; rather, differential cortical activity depends on the extent to which their different grammatical functions are engaged.

pmid_12191459,Neural basis of the retrieval of people's names: evidence from brain-damaged patients and fMRI.,,"The aim of this study was to identify the neuroanatomical basis of the retrieval of people's names. Lesion data showed that patients with language-dominant temporal lobectomy had impairments in their ability to retrieve familiar and newly learned people's names, whereas patients with language-nondominant temporal lobectomy had difficulty retrieving newly learned people's names. Functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments revealed activations in the left temporal polar region during the retrieval of familiar and newly learned people's names, and in the right superior temporal and bilateral prefrontal cortices during the retrieval of newly learned information from face cues. These data provide new evidence that the left anterior temporal region is crucial for the retrieval of people's names irrespective of their familiarity and that the right superior temporal and bilateral prefrontal areas are crucial for the process of associating newly learned people's faces and names.

This cross-sectional study included 42 healthy elderly women within two groups: Tai Chi ( Episodic memory in the Tai Chi group was superior to that of the walking group. Higher gray matter density in the inferior and medial temporal regions (including the hippocampus) and higher ReHo in temporal regions (specifically the fusiform gyrus and hippocampus) were found in the Tai Chi group. Significant partial correlations were found between the gray matter density of the left hippocampus and episodic memory in the whole sample. Significant partial correlations were observed between the ReHo in left hippocampus, left parahippocampal, left fusiform, and delayed memory task, which was observed among all subjects. The present study suggests that long-term Tai Chi practice may improve memory performance via remodeling the structure and function of the hippocampus. ",
pmid_19803684,Dissociable roles of the anterior temporal regions in successful encoding of memory for person identity information.,,"Memory for person identity information consists of three main components: face-related information, name-related information, and person-related semantic information, such as the person's job title. Although previous studies have demonstrated the importance of the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) in the retrieval of associations between these kinds of information, there is no evidence concerning whether the ATL region contributes to the encoding of this memory, and whether ATL roles are dissociable between different levels of association in this memory. Using fMRI, we investigated dissociable roles within the ATL during successful encoding of this memory. During encoding, participants viewed unfamiliar faces, each paired with a job title and name. During retrieval, each learned face was presented with two job titles or two names, and participants were required to choose the correct job title or name. Successful encoding conditions were categorized by subsequent retrieval conditions: successful encoding of names and job titles (HNJ), names (HN), and job titles (HJ). The study yielded three main findings. First, the dorsal ATL showed greater activations in HNJ than in HN or HJ. Second, ventral ATL activity was greater in HNJ and HJ than in HN. Third, functional connectivity between these regions was significant during successful encoding. The results are the first to demonstrate that the dorsal and ventral ATL roles are dissociable between two steps of association, associations of person-related semantics with name and with face, and a dorsal-ventral ATL interaction predicts subsequent retrieval success of memory for person identity information.

pmid_9305814,Neural control of fast-regular saccades and antisaccades: an investigation using positron emission tomography.,,"Regional cerebral blood flow changes related to the performance of two oculomotor tasks and a central fixation task were compared in ten healthy human subjects. The tasks were: (a) performance of fast-regular saccades; (b) performance of voluntary antisaccades away from a peripheral cue; (c) passive maintenance of central visual fixation in the presence of irrelevant peripheral stimulation. The saccadic task was associated with a relative increase in activity in a number of occipitotemporal areas. Compared with both the fixation and the saccadic task, the performance of antisaccades activated a set of areas including: the superior and inferior parietal lobules, the precentral and prefrontal cortex, the cingulate cortex, and the supplementary motor area. The results of the present study suggest that: (a) compared with self-determined saccadic responses the performance of fast regular, reflexive saccades produces a limited activation of the frontal eye fields; (b) in the antisaccadic task the inferior parietal lobes subserve operations of sensory-motor integration dealing with attentional disengagement from the initial peripheral cue (appearing at an invalid spatial location) and with the recomputation of the antisaccadic vector on the basis of the wrong (e.g., spatially opposite) information provided by the same cue.

pmid_21757014,Separate encoding of model-based and model-free valuations in the human brain.,,"Behavioral studies have long shown that humans solve problems in two ways, one intuitive and fast (System 1, model-free), and the other reflective and slow (System 2, model-based). The neurobiological basis of dual process problem solving remains unknown due to challenges of separating activation in concurrent systems. We present a novel neuroeconomic task that predicts distinct subjective valuation and updating signals corresponding to these two systems. We found two concurrent value signals in human prefrontal cortex: a System 1 model-free reinforcement signal and a System 2 model-based Bayesian signal. We also found a System 1 updating signal in striatal areas and a System 2 updating signal in lateral prefrontal cortex. Further, signals in prefrontal cortex preceded choices that are optimal according to either updating principle, while signals in anterior cingulate cortex and globus pallidus preceded deviations from optimal choice for reinforcement learning. These deviations tended to occur when uncertainty regarding optimal values was highest, suggesting that disagreement between dual systems is mediated by uncertainty rather than conflict, confirming recent theoretical proposals.

Voxel-based morphometry","To comprehensively summarize and meta-analyze the concurrence across voxel-based morphometric (VBM) neuroimaging studies of migraine. Neuroimaging studies published from origin to August 1, 2021 were searched in six databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, and Chongqing VIP. Study selection, quality assessment, and data extraction were conducted by two independent researchers. Anisotropic effect size-signed differential mapping (AES-SDM) and activation likelihood estimation (ALE) were used to perform the meta-analysis of available studies reporting whole-brain gray matter (GM) structural data in migraine patients. Clinical variables correlation analysis and migraine subgroup analysis were also conducted. 40 articles were included after the strict screening, containing 1616 migraine patients and 1681 matched healthy subjects (HS) in total. Using the method of AES-SDM, migraine patients showed GM increase in the bilateral amygdala, the bilateral parahippocampus, the bilateral temporal poles, the bilateral superior temporal gyri, the left hippocampus, the right superior frontal gyrus, and the left middle temporal gyrus, as well as GM decrease in the left insula, the bilateral cerebellum (hemispheric lobule IX), the right dorsal medulla, the bilateral rolandic operculum, the right middle frontal gyrus, and the right inferior parietal gyrus. Using the method of ALE, migraine patients showed GM increase in the left parahippocampus and GM decrease in the left insula. The results of correlation analysis showed that many of these brain regions were associated with migraine headache frequency and migraine disease duration. Migraine patients in different subtypes (such as migraine without aura (MwoA), migraine with aura (MwA), episodic migraine (EM), chronic migraine (CM), vestibular migraine (VM), etc.), and in different periods (in the ictal and interictal periods) presented not entirely consistent GM alterations. Migraine patients have GM alterations in multiple brain regions associated with sensation, affection, cognition, and descending modulation aspects of pain. These changes might be a consequence of repeated migraine attacks. Further studies are required to determine how these GM changes can be used to diagnose, monitor disease progression, or exploit potential therapeutic interventions for migraine patients. ",
pmid_25738502,Decreased prefrontal lobe interhemispheric functional connectivity in adolescents with internet gaming disorder: a primary study using resting-state FMRI.,,"Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that people with Internet gaming disorder (IGD) have structural and functional abnormalities in specific brain areas and connections. However, little is known about the alterations of the interhemispheric resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in participants with IGD. In the present study, we used a newly developed voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) method to investigate the interhemispheric rsFC of the whole brain in participants with IGD. We compared interhemispheric rsFC between 17 participants with IGD and 24 healthy controls, group-matched on age, gender, and education status. All participants were provided written informed consent. Resting-state functional and structural magnetic resonance images were acquired for all participants. The rsFC between bilateral homotopic voxels was calculated. Regions showing abnormal VMHC in IGD participants were adopted as regions of interest for correlation analyses. Compared to healthy controls, IGD participants showed decreased VMHC between the left and right superior frontal gyrus (orbital part), inferior frontal gyrus (orbital part), middle frontal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus. Further analyses showed Chen Internet Addiction Scale (CIAS)-related VMHC in superior frontal gyrus (orbital part) and CIAS (r = -0.55, p = 0.02, uncorrected). Our findings implicate the important role of altered interhemispheric rsFC in the bilateral prefrontal lobe in the neuropathological mechanism of IGD, and provide further supportive evidence for the reclassification of IGD as a behavioral addiction.

pmid_23510564,Neural responses to fearful eyes in children with conduct problems and varying levels of callous-unemotional traits.,,"Children with conduct problems (CP) are a heterogeneous group. Those with high levels of callous-unemotional traits (CP/HCU) appear emotionally under-reactive at behavioural and neural levels whereas those with low levels of CU traits (CP/LCU) appear emotionally over-reactive, compared with typically developing (TD) controls. Investigating the degree to which these patterns of emotional reactivity are malleable may have important translational implications. Instructing participants with CP/HCU to focus on the eyes of fearful faces (i.e. the most salient feature) can ameliorate their fear-recognition deficits, but it is unknown whether this is mediated by amygdala response. It is also unknown whether focusing on fearful eyes is associated with increased amygdala reactivity in CP/LCU. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to measure neural responses to fearful and calm faces in children with CP/HCU, CP/LCU and TD controls (n = 17 per group). On half of trials participants looked for a blue dot anywhere within target faces; on the other half, participants were directed to focus on the eye region. Reaction time (RT) data showed that CP/LCU were selectively slowed in the fear/eyes condition. For the same condition, CP/LCU also showed increased amygdala and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC)/orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) responses compared with TD controls. RT and amygdala response to fear/eyes were correlated in CP/LCU only. No effects of focusing on the eye region were observed in CP/HCU. These data extend the evidence base suggesting that CU traits index meaningful heterogeneity in conduct problems. Focusing on regulating reactive emotional responses may be a fruitful strategy for children with CP/LCU. ",

Risky decision-making","The present study identified the neural mechanism of risky decision-making in Internet gaming disorder (IGD) under a probability discounting task. Independent component analysis was used on the functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 19 IGD subjects (22.2 ± 3.08 years) and 21 healthy controls (HC, 22.8 ± 3.5 years). For the behavioral results, IGD subjects prefer the risky to the fixed options and showed shorter reaction time compared to HC. For the imaging results, the IGD subjects showed higher task-related activity in default mode network (DMN) and less engagement in the executive control network (ECN) than HC when making the risky decisions. Also, we found the activities of DMN correlate negatively with the reaction time and the ECN correlate positively with the probability discounting rates. The results suggest that people with IGD show altered modulation in DMN and deficit in executive control function, which might be the reason for why the IGD subjects continue to play online games despite the potential negative consequences.

This study aims to set up a potential approach to non-deqi control by using lidocaine anesthesia at ST36. Methods. Forty healthy volunteers were recruited and they received two fMRI scans. One was accompanied with manual acupuncture at ST36 (DQ group), and another was associated with both local anesthesia and manual acupuncture at the same acupoint (LA group). Results. Comparing to DQ group, more than 90 percent deqi sensations were reduced by local anesthesia in LA group. The mainly activated regions in DQ group were bilateral IFG, S1, primary motor cortex, IPL, thalamus, insula, claustrum, cingulate gyrus, putamen, superior temporal gyrus, and cerebellum. Surprisingly only cerebellum showed significant activation in LA group. Compared to the two groups, bilateral S1, insula, ipsilateral IFG, IPL, claustrum, and contralateral ACC were remarkably activated. Conclusions. Local anesthesia at ST36 is able to block most of the deqi feelings and inhibit brain responses to deqi, which would be developed into a potential approach for non-deqi control. Bilateral S1, insula, ipsilateral IFG, IPL, claustrum, and contralateral ACC might be the key brain regions responding to deqi. ",

fMRI","Two of the most commonly used substances by adolescents in the United States are cannabis and alcohol. Cannabis use disorder (CUD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) are associated with impairments in decision-making processes. One mechanism for impaired decision-making in these individuals is thought to be an inability to adequately represent future events during decision-making. In the current study involving 112 adolescents, we used a comparative optimism task to examine the relationship between relative severity of CUD/AUD (as indexed by the CUD/AUD Identification Tests [CUDIT/AUDIT]) and atypical function within neural systems underlying affect-based neural represenation future events. Greater CUDIT scores were negatively related to responses within subgenual anterior and posterior cingulate cortex when processing high-intensity potential future positive and negative events. There was also a particularly marked negative relationship between CUD symptoms and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses within visual and premotor cortices to high-intensity, negatively valenced potential future events. However, AUD symptom severity was not associated with dysfunction within these brain regions. These data indicate that relative risk/severity of CUD is associated with reduced responsiveness to future high-intensity events. This may impair decision-making where future significant consequences should guide response choice. ",

Based on models of drug addictions and the extant literature on Internet gaming disorder (IGD), we propose a cognitive-behavioral model for conceptualizing IGD. The model focuses on three domains and their roles in addictive behaviors. The three domains include motivational drives related to reward-seeking and stress-reduction, behavioral control relating to executive inhibition, and decision-making that involves weighing the pros and cons of engaging in motivated behaviors. Based on this model, we propose how behavioral therapies might target these domains in the treatment of IGD. ",

Response inhibition","The ability to successfully inhibit an inappropriate behaviour is a crucial component of executive functioning and its impairment has been linked to substance dependence. Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug in adolescence and, given the accelerated neuromaturation during adolescence, it is important to determine the effects of cannabis use on neurocognitive functioning during this developmental period. In this study, a cohort of adolescent heavy cannabis users and age-matched non-cannabis-using controls completed a Go/No-Go paradigm. Users were impaired in performance on the task but voxelwise and region-of-interest comparisons revealed no activation differences between groups. Instead, an analysis of correlation patterns between task-activated areas revealed heightened correlation scores in the users between bilateral inferior parietal lobules and the left cerebellum. The increased correlation activity between these regions was replicated with resting state fMRI data and was positively correlated with self-reported, recent cannabis usage. The results suggests that the poorer inhibitory control of adolescent cannabis users might be related to aberrant connectivity between nodes of the response inhibition circuit and that this effect is observable in both task-induced and intrinsic correlation patterns. This article is part of the Special Issue Section entitled 'Neuroimaging in Neuropharmacology'. ",
pmid_26053998,Distinct inter-hemispheric dysconnectivity in schizophrenia patients with and without auditory verbal hallucinations.,,"Evidence from behavioral, electrophysiological and diffusion-weighted imaging studies suggest that schizophrenia patients suffer from deficiencies in bilateral brain communication, and this disruption may be related to the occurrence of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH). To increase our understanding of aberrant inter-hemispheric communication in relation to AVH, we recruited two groups of first-episode schizophrenia patients: one group with AVH (N = 18 AVH patients) and one without hallucinations (N = 18 Non-AVH patients), and 20 healthy controls. All participants received T1 structural imaging and resting-state fMRI scanning. We adopted a newly developed index, voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC), to quantitatively describe bilateral functional connectivity. The whole-brain VMHC measure was compared among the three groups and correlation analyses were conducted between symptomology scores and neurological measures. Our findings suggest all patients shared abnormalities in parahippocampus and striatum. Aberrant bilateral connectivity of default mode network (DMN), inferior frontal gyrus and cerebellum only showed in AVH patients, whereas aberrances in superior temporal gyrus and precentral gyrus were specific to Non-AVH patients. Meanwhile, inter-hemispheric connectivity of DMN correlated with patients' symptomatology scores. This study corroborates that schizophrenia is characterized by inter-hemispheric dysconnectivity, and suggests the localization of such abnormalities may be crucial to whether auditory verbal hallucinations develop.

In this study, marijuana-using young adults (MJ; n = 20) and controls (CON; n = 23) performed a decision-making task in which they made a perceptual choice after viewing the choices of unknown peers via photographs, while they underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. The MJ and CON groups did not show differences in the overall number of choices that agreed with versus opposed group influence, but only the MJ group showed reaction time slowing when deciding against group choices. Longer reaction times were associated with greater activation of frontal regions. The MJ goup, compared to CON, showed significantly greater activation in the caudate when presented with peer information. Across groups, caudate activation was associated with self-reported susceptibility to influence. These findings indicate that young adults who use MJ may exhibit increased effort when confronted with opposing peer influence, as well as exhibit greater responsivity of the caudate to social information. These results not only better define the neural basis of social decisions, but also suggest that marijuana use is associated with exaggerated neural activity during decision making that involves social information.

The current study examined whether the anatomical connectivity between these two systems predicted individual variability in achieving a healthy body weight, particularly in chronic dieters. Thirty-six female chronic dieters completed a food-cue reactivity task in the scanner. Two regions-of-interest (ROIs) were defined from the reactivity task: the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), which engages cognitive control and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), which represents reward value. A white matter tract connecting these two ROIs was identified across participants using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and probabilistic tractography. Results showed a negative relationship between body fat percentage and white matter integrity within the identified tract. This suggests that reduced structural integrity between the OFC and IFG may be related to self-regulatory problems for those who chronically diet to control body weight. ",

Fourteen studies on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, with 316 schizophrenia patients, 342 healthy controls, and 66 unaffected relatives, were included in the meta-analysis. This analysis was performed using anisotropic effect-size-based signed differential mapping software. Schizophrenia patients showed increased ReHo in right superior frontal gyrus and right superior temporal gyrus, as well as decreased ReHo in left fusiform gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, and right precentral gyrus. Unaffected relatives showed decreased ReHo in right insula and right superior temporal gyrus. These results remained widely unchanged in both sensitivity and subgroup analyses. Schizophrenia patients and their unaffected relatives had extensive abnormal localized connectivity in cerebrum, especially in superior temporal gyrus, which were the potential diagnostic markers and expounded the pathophysiological hypothesis for the disorder.

pmid_21078303,Perimenopausal use of hormone therapy is associated with enhanced memory and hippocampal function later in life.,,"Evidence suggests that initiation of some forms of hormone therapy (HT) early in the perimenopausal or postmenopausal stage might confer benefit to verbal memory and the neural systems underlying memory, whereas late-life initiation confers no benefit or harm. This ""critical window hypothesis"" remains a topic of debate. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined the long-term impact of perimenopausal HT use on brain function during performance of verbal and figural memory tasks. Participants were 34 postmenopausal women (mean age 60 years) from the Melbourne Women's Midlife Health Project and included 17 early (perimenopausal) and continuous users of HT and 17 never users matched on age, education, and verbal knowledge. Continuous HT use from the perimenopausal stage versus no use was validated with prospective daily diary records and study visit data. The primary outcome was patterns of brain activation in an a priori region of interest in the medial temporal lobe during verbal encoding and recognition of words. Results indicated that perimenopausal HT users performed better than nonusers on the imaging verbal memory task (p<.05). During verbal recognition, perimenopausal HT users showed increased activation in the left hippocampus and decreased activation in the parahippocampal gyrus bilaterally compared with never users. Each of these patterns of activation was associated with better memory performance on the imaging memory task. These results suggest that perimenopausal use of HT might confer long-term benefits to verbal memory and the brain systems underlying verbal memory. More generally, the results support the critical window hypothesis. ",

We aimed to identify neural substrates associated with emotional reactivity and to assess the effects of stimulants on those substrates. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess neural activity in adolescents with (n = 15) and without (n = 15) ADHD while they performed a task involving the subliminal presentation of fearful faces. Using dynamic causal modeling, we also examined the effective connectivity of two regions associated with emotional reactivity, i.e., the amygdala and the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC). The participants with ADHD underwent scanning both on and off stimulant medication in a counterbalanced fashion. During the task, we found that activity in the right amygdala was greater in adolescents with ADHD than in control subjects. In addition, in adolescents with ADHD, greater connectivity was detected between the amygdala and LPFC. Stimulants had a normalizing effect on both the activity in the right amygdala and the connectivity between the amygdala and LPFC. Our findings demonstrate that in adolescents with ADHD, a neural substrate of fear processing is atypical, as is the connectivity between the amygdala and LPFC. These findings suggest possible neural substrates for the emotional reactivity that is often present in youths with ADHD, and provide putative neural targets for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for this condition.

pmid_20385169,Hippocampal activation during retrieval of spatial context from episodic and semantic memory.,,"The hippocampus, a region implicated in the processing of spatial information and episodic memory, is central to the debate concerning the relationship between episodic and semantic memory. Studies of medial temporal lobe amnesic patients provide evidence that the hippocampus is critical for the retrieval of episodic but not semantic memory. On the other hand, recent neuroimaging studies of intact individuals report hippocampal activation during retrieval of both autobiographical memories and semantic information that includes historical facts, famous faces, and categorical information, suggesting that episodic and semantic memory may engage the hippocampus during memory retrieval in similar ways. Few studies have matched episodic and semantic tasks for the degree to which they include spatial content, even though spatial content may be what drives hippocampal activation during semantic retrieval. To examine this issue, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in which retrieval of spatial and nonspatial information was compared during an episodic and semantic recognition task. Results show that the hippocampus (1) participates preferentially in the retrieval of episodic memories; (2) is also engaged by retrieval of semantic memories, particularly those that include spatial information. These data suggest that sharp dissociations between episodic and semantic memory may be overly simplistic and that the hippocampus plays a role in the retrieval of spatial content whether drawn from a memory of one's own life experiences or real-world semantic knowledge.

Furthermore, we examined the influence of hypertension on CBF alterations in T2DM patients. T2DM patients (n = 38) and non-T2DM subjects (n = 40) were recruited from clinics, hospitals, and normal community health screenings. Cerebral blood flow images were collected and analyzed using arterial spin labeling perfusion functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Regions with major CBF differences between T2DM patients and non-T2DM controls were detected via 1-way ANOVA. The interaction effects between hypertension and T2DM for CBF alterations were also examined. Correlation analyses illustrated the association between CBF values and cognitive performance and between CBF and blood pressure. Compared with non-T2DM controls, T2DM patients exhibited decreased CBF, primarily in the visual area and the default mode network (DMN); decreased CBF in these regions was correlated with cognitive performance. There was a significant interaction effect between hypertension and diabetes for CBF in the precuneus and the middle occipital gyrus. Additionally, blood pressure correlated negatively with CBF in T2DM patients.T2DM patients exhibited reduced CBF in the visual area and DMN. Hypertension may facilitate a CBF decrease in the setting of diabetes. T2DM patients may benefit from blood pressure control to maintain their brain perfusion through CBF preservation. ",
pmid_19632301,Attentional modulation of emotional stimulus processing in patients with major depression--alterations in prefrontal cortical regions.,,"Patients with depression show an impaired ability to modulate emotional states and to process positive emotional information. Here we examined expectancy-induced modulation of emotional picture processing in major depression. We hypothesized alterations in the medial prefrontal cortex. During fMRI, 15 depressed and 21 healthy control subjects passively viewed affective photographs. Half of the pictures were preceded by an expectancy cue signaling whether an emotionally salient or neutral picture would follow. The contrast 'cued versus uncued emotional picture viewing' was used to study modulation of emotional picture processing by preceding attention. Healthy individuals showed enhanced activation in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and decreased activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during cued compared to uncued emotional picture perception. The group comparison revealed that these modulatory effects were significantly attenuated in depressed patients. This attenuation was particularly observed in the positive compared to the negative picture condition and tended to normalize in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex after remission of symptoms. Altered prefrontal modulation in depression may contribute to impaired affect modulation and related clinical symptoms, such as anhedonia. ",
pmid_24856553,Neural response to reward anticipation in those with depression with and without panic disorder.,"Anterior cingulate cortex
Major depressive disorder
Panic disorder
Reward anticipation","One of the hallmark features of major depressive disorder (MDD) is reduced reward anticipation. There have been mixed findings in the literature as to whether reward anticipation deficits in MDD are related to diminished mesolimbic activation and/or enhanced dorsal anterior cingulate activation (dACC). One of the reasons for these mixed findings is that these studies have typically not addressed the role of comorbid anxiety, a class of disorders which frequently co-occur with depression and have a common neurobiology. The aim of the current study was to examine group differences in neural responses to reward anticipation in 40 adults with either: (1) current MDD with no lifetime diagnosis of an anxiety disorder (MDD-only), (2) current MDD with comorbid panic disorder (MDD-PD), or (3) no lifetime diagnosis of psychopathology. All participants completed a passive slot machine task during a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan. Analyses indicated that there were no group differences in activation of mesolimbic reward regions; however, the MDD-only group exhibited greater dACC activation during the anticipation of rewards compared with the healthy controls and the comorbid MDD-PD group (who did not differ from each other). The sample size was small which limits generalizability. These findings provide preliminary support for the role of hyperactive dACC functioning in reduced reward anticipation in MDD. They also indicate that comorbid anxiety may alter the association between MDD and neural responding to reward anticipation. ",
pmid_12495527,Rethinking feelings: an FMRI study of the cognitive regulation of emotion.,,"The ability to cognitively regulate emotional responses to aversive events is important for mental and physical health. Little is known, however, about neural bases of the cognitive control of emotion. The present study employed functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the neural systems used to reappraise highly negative scenes in unemotional terms. Reappraisal of highly negative scenes reduced subjective experience of negative affect. Neural correlates of reappraisal were increased activation of the lateral and medial prefrontal regions and decreased activation of the amygdala and medial orbito-frontal cortex. These findings support the hypothesis that prefrontal cortex is involved in constructing reappraisal strategies that can modulate activity in multiple emotion-processing systems. ",
pmid_15193595,Cortical lateralization during verb generation: a combined ERP and fMRI study.,,"Lateralization of scalp-recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) and functional MRI (fMRI) activation was investigated using a verb generation task in 10 healthy right-handed adults. ERPs showed an early transient positivity in the left inferior temporal region (500-1250 ms) following auditory presentation of the stimulus noun. A sustained slow cortical negativity of later onset (1250-3000 ms) was then recorded, most pronounced over left inferior frontal regions. fMRI data were in agreement with both ERP effects, showing left lateralized activation in inferior and superior temporal as well as inferior frontal cortices. Lateralized ERP effects occurred during the verb generation task but not during passive word listening or during word- and nonword repetition. Thus, ERPs and fMRI provided convergent evidence regarding language lateralization, with ERPs revealing the temporal sequence of posterior to anterior cortical activation during semantic retrieval.

pmid_21451498,Methylphenidate normalizes fronto-striatal underactivation during interference inhibition in medication-naïve boys with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.,,"Youth with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have deficits in interference inhibition, which can be improved with the indirect catecholamine agonist methylphenidate (MPH). Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate the effects of a single dose of MPH on brain activation during interference inhibition in medication-naïve ADHD boys. Medication-naïve boys with ADHD were scanned twice, in a randomized, double-blind design, under either a single clinical dose of MPH or placebo, while performing a Simon task that measures interference inhibition and controls for the oddball effect of low-frequency appearance of incongruent trials. Brain activation was compared within patients under either drug condition. To test for potential normalization effects of MPH, brain activation in ADHD patients under either drug condition was compared with that of healthy age-matched comparison boys. During incongruent trials compared with congruent-oddball trials, boys with ADHD under placebo relative to controls showed reduced brain activation in typical areas of interference inhibition, including right inferior prefrontal cortex, left striatum and thalamus, mid-cingulate/supplementary motor area, and left superior temporal lobe. MPH relative to placebo upregulated brain activation in right inferior prefrontal and premotor cortices. Under the MPH condition, patients relative to controls no longer showed the reduced activation in right inferior prefrontal and striato-thalamic regions. Effect size comparison, furthermore, showed that these normalization effects were significant. MPH significantly normalized the fronto-striatal underfunctioning in ADHD patients relative to controls during interference inhibition, but did not affect medial frontal or temporal dysfunction. MPH therefore appears to have a region-specific upregulation effect on fronto-striatal activation. ",

value","Considering the neuroscientific findings on reward, learning, value, decision-making, and cognitive control, motivation can be parsed into three sub processes, a process of generating motivation, a process of maintaining motivation, and a process of regulating motivation. I propose a tentative neuroscientific model of motivational processes which consists of three distinct but continuous sub processes, namely reward-driven approach, value-based decision-making, and goal-directed control. Reward-driven approach is the process in which motivation is generated by reward anticipation and selective approach behaviors toward reward. This process recruits the ventral striatum (reward area) in which basic stimulus-action association is formed, and is classified as an automatic motivation to which relatively less attention is assigned. By contrast, value-based decision-making is the process of evaluating various outcomes of actions, learning through positive prediction error, and calculating the value continuously. The striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex (valuation area) play crucial roles in sustaining motivation. Lastly, the goal-directed control is the process of regulating motivation through cognitive control to achieve goals. This consciously controlled motivation is associated with higher-level cognitive functions such as planning, retaining the goal, monitoring the performance, and regulating action. The anterior cingulate cortex (attention area) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (cognitive control area) are the main neural circuits related to regulation of motivation. These three sub processes interact with each other by sending reward prediction error signals through dopaminergic pathway from the striatum and to the prefrontal cortex. The neuroscientific model of motivational process suggests several educational implications with regard to the generation, maintenance, and regulation of motivation to learn in the learning environment.

pmid_16284969,Developmental changes in the functional brain responses of adolescents to images of high and low-calorie foods.,,"We examined cerebral responses to visually presented food images in children and adolescents. Eight healthy normal-weight females (ages 9-15) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while viewing photographs of high- and low-calorie foods and dining utensils. In general, food images yielded significant activation within the inferior orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, and fusiform gyri. High calorie food images activated the left hippocampus and subgenual cingulate, and age correlated positively with activity within the orbitofrontal cortex but negatively with activity within the anterior cingulate gyrus. Low-calorie foods activated the fusiform gyrus and demonstrated age-related increases in the left superior temporal gyrus and anterior cingulate. Utensils activated the fusiform gyrus and showed age-related increases in the prefrontal cortex. Data were also compared statistically to a sample of adults exposed to the same stimulus conditions. Findings support a developmental model of adolescent maturation whereby age-related changes in cerebral functioning develop from lower-order sensory processing toward higher-order processing of stimuli via prefrontal cortical systems involved in reward anticipation, self-monitoring, and behavioral inhibition.

pmid_23082151,Is he being bad? Social and language brain networks during social judgment in children with autism.,,"Individuals with autism often violate social rules and have lower accuracy in identifying and explaining inappropriate social behavior. Twelve children with autism (AD) and thirteen children with typical development (TD) participated in this fMRI study of the neurofunctional basis of social judgment. Participants indicated in which of two pictures a boy was being bad (Social condition) or which of two pictures was outdoors (Physical condition). In the within-group Social-Physical comparison, TD children used components of mentalizing and language networks [bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), bilateral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and bilateral posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS)], whereas AD children used a network that was primarily right IFG and bilateral pSTS, suggesting reduced use of social and language networks during this social judgment task. A direct group comparison on the Social-Physical contrast showed that the TD group had greater mPFC, bilateral IFG, and left superior temporal pole activity than the AD group. No regions were more active in the AD group than in the group with TD in this comparison. Both groups successfully performed the task, which required minimal language. The groups also performed similarly on eyetracking measures, indicating that the activation results probably reflect the use of a more basic strategy by the autism group rather than performance disparities. Even though language was unnecessary, the children with TD recruited language areas during the social task, suggesting automatic encoding of their knowledge into language; however, this was not the case for the children with autism. These findings support behavioral research indicating that, whereas children with autism may recognize socially inappropriate behavior, they have difficulty using spoken language to explain why it is inappropriate. The fMRI results indicate that AD children may not automatically use language to encode their social understanding, making expression and generalization of this knowledge more difficult. ",

reaching visual target","Targets for goal-directed action can be encoded in allocentric coordinates (relative to another visual landmark), but it is not known how these are converted into egocentric commands for action. Here, we investigated this using a slow event-related fMRI paradigm, based on our previous behavioural finding that the allocentric-to-egocentric (Allo-Ego) conversion for reach is performed at the first possible opportunity. Participants were asked to remember (and eventually reach towards) the location of a briefly presented target relative to another visual landmark. After a first memory delay, participants were forewarned by a verbal instruction if the landmark would reappear at the same location (potentially allowing them to plan a reach following the auditory cue before the second delay), or at a different location where they had to wait for the final landmark to be presented before response, and then reach towards the remembered target location. As predicted, participants showed landmark-centred directional selectivity in occipital-temporal cortex during the first memory delay, and only developed egocentric directional selectivity in occipital-parietal cortex during the second delay for the 'Same cue' task, and during response for the 'Different cue' task. We then compared cortical activation between these two tasks at the times when the Allo-Ego conversion occurred, and found common activation in right precuneus, right presupplementary area and bilateral dorsal premotor cortex. These results confirm that the brain converts allocentric codes to egocentric plans at the first possible opportunity, and identify the four most likely candidate sites specific to the Allo-Ego transformation for reaches.

pmid_15570157,Brain activation to emotional words in depressed vs healthy subjects.,,"Depression involves either enhanced processing of negative stimuli or diminished processing of positive stimuli. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess brain activation in depressed vs healthy participants. Fifteen participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder and 15 controls were scanned during a lexical decision task involving neutral, happy, sad, and threat-related words. For happy words, depressed subjects exhibited less activation than did controls to happy words in fronto-temporal and limbic regions. For sad words, depressed subjects showed more activation than did controls in the inferior parietal lobule and less activation in the superior temporal gyrus and cerebellum, suggesting a complex activation pattern that varies for neural sub-circuits that may be associated with different cognitive or behavioral processes.

Medial temporal lobe
Temporal context retrieval","Temporal context, memory for the timing of events, can be assessed using non-temporal strategies such as relative familiarity or inference from a semantic narrative. Neuroimaging studies, which have previously encouraged such strategies, find similar patterns of brain regions involved in both temporal and non-temporal context memory. The present study aims to investigate whether previous findings are driven by the use of non-temporal strategies or whether the same pattern of brain regions is identified when relative familiarity and semantic narrative strategies are discouraged. We used abstract phrases (e.g. alone me leave) created by scrambling familiar three-word phrases. The words in the phrases were less concrete than the object image stimuli used in previous studies of temporal context memory (Jenkins and Ranganath, 2010) and were presented quickly while participants read each word aloud. This differed from previous studies in which participants were encouraged to use narrative strategies during encoding (Tubridy and Davachi, 2011) and was designed to discourage use of narrative strategies. The relative familiarity of the words within each phrase was similar and likely not diagnostic of word order during encoding, in order to minimize the use of relative familiarity strategies. Neuroimaging results indicate that temporal context retrieval was associated with the hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and retrosplenial cortex, which are regions consistent with the retrieval of non-temporal context in episodic memory, suggesting that previous findings were not driven entirely by non-temporal strategies but rather that temporal memory relies on similar brain regions to non-temporal memory.

At present, voxel based morphometry (VBM) is easily applicable to the routine clinical procedure with a short execution time. The importance of the VBM approach is that it is not biased to one particular structure and is able to assess anatomical differences throughout the brain. Stand-alone VBM software running on Windows, Voxel-based Specific Regional analysis system for AD (VSRAD), has been widely used in the clinical diagnosis of AD in Japan. On the other hand, recent application of graph theory to MRI has made it possible to analyze changes in structural connectivity in AD. ",

However, the exact whole brainstem structural changes in vivo have not yet been identified in medication-overuse headache (MOH) transformed from migraine. The aim of this study was to investigate the regional volume changes over the whole brainstem in the MOH patients using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in vivo. High-resolution three-dimensional structural images were obtained using a 3.0-Tesla magnetic resonance system from 36 MOH patients and 32 normal controls (NCs) who were consecutively recruited from the International Headache Center, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, from March 2013 to June 2016. VBM was used to assess the brainstem structural alteration in the MOH patients, and voxel-wise correlation was performed to evaluate the relationship with the clinical characteristics. The brainstem region with increased volume located in the left ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (MNI coordinate: -1, -33, -8), ventral tegmental area (MNI coordinate: 0, -22, -12), bilateral substantia nigra (MNI coordinate: -8, -16, -12, 9, -16, -12), and trigeminal root entry zone (MNI coordinate: -19, -29, -31; 19, -32, -29) in MOH patients compared with NCs. The headache visual analog scale score was positively related with the left rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) (MNI coordinate: -1, -37, -56; cluster size: 20; r = 0.602) in the MOH patients. The regional volume gain of brainstem could underlie the neuromechanism of impaired ascending and descending pathway in the MOH patients, and the left RVM volume alteration could imply the impaired tolerance of nociceptive pain input and could be used to assess the headache disability in the MOH patients.

superior temporal gyrus","The presence of gesture during speech has been shown to impact perception, comprehension, learning, and memory in normal adults and typically developing children. In neurotypical individuals, the impact of viewing co-speech gestures representing an object and/or action (i.e., iconic gesture) or speech rhythm (i.e., beat gesture) has also been observed at the neural level. Yet, despite growing evidence of delayed gesture development in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), few studies have examined how the brain processes multimodal communicative cues occurring during everyday communication in individuals with ASD. Here, we used a previously validated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm to examine the neural processing of co-speech beat gesture in children with ASD and matched controls. Consistent with prior observations in adults, typically developing children showed increased responses in right superior temporal gyrus and sulcus while listening to speech accompanied by beat gesture. Children with ASD, however, exhibited no significant modulatory effects in secondary auditory cortices for the presence of co-speech beat gesture. Rather, relative to their typically developing counterparts, children with ASD showed significantly greater activity in visual cortex while listening to speech accompanied by beat gesture. Importantly, the severity of their socio-communicative impairments correlated with activity in this region, such that the more impaired children demonstrated the greatest activity in visual areas while viewing co-speech beat gesture. These findings suggest that although the typically developing brain recognizes beat gesture as communicative and successfully integrates it with co-occurring speech, information from multiple sensory modalities is not effectively integrated during social communication in the autistic brain.

pmid_17208462,Neural evidence for Reference-dependence in real-market-transactions.,,"Human decision making has become one of the major research-foci in economics, marketing and in neuroscience. This study integrates perspectives from these disciplines by examining neurophysiological correlates to Reference-dependence of utility evaluations in real market contexts both before and after choice. First, by comparing buying and selling decisions, we observe an activation of the amygdala only in the latter. We interpret this as loss aversion with respect to prior possessions. This finding contributes to the settling of an ongoing fundamental dispute in economic theory by indicating the absence of loss aversion for money in routine transactions. Second, ex post satisfaction statements are accompanied by an activation of the reward processing orbitofrontal cortex, if the evaluation context is framed by a high external reference price instead of a lower internal reference price. This indicates a nonrational Reference-dependence--despite the neoclassical view of a rational Homo Economicus--of satisfaction measures and challenges a central marketing variable. ",
pmid_20136647,EFNS guidelines on the use of neuroimaging in the management of motor neuron diseases.,,"These European Federation of Neurological Societies guidelines on neuroimaging of motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are designed to provide practical help for the neurologists to make appropriate use of neuroimaging techniques in patients with MNDs, which ranges from diagnostic and monitoring aspects to the in vivo study of the pathobiology of such conditions. Literature searches were performed before expert members of the Task Force wrote proposal. Then, consensus was reached by circulating drafts of the manuscript to the Task Force members and by discussion of the classification of evidence and recommendations. The use of conventional MRI in patients suspected of having a MND is yet restricted to exclude other causes of signs and symptoms of MN pathology [class IV, level good clinical practice point (GCPP)]. Although the detection of corticospinal tract hyperintensities on conventional MRI and a T2-hypointense rim in the pre-central gyrus can support a pre-existing suspicion of MND, the specific search of these abnormalities for the purpose of making a firm diagnosis of MND is not recommended (class IV, level GCPP). At present, advanced neuroimaging techniques, including diffusion tensor imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging, do not have a role in the diagnosis or routine monitoring of MNDs yet (class IV, level GCPP). However, it is strongly advisable to incorporate measures derived from these techniques into new clinical trials as exploratory outcomes to gain additional insights into disease pathophysiology and into the value of these techniques in the (longitudinal) assessment of MNDs (class IV, level GCPP).

We applied event-related fMRI (er-fMRI) in conjunction with ANS recording (heart rate, HR; skin conductance response, SCR). Brief manual acupuncture stimuli were delivered at acupoints ST36 and SP9, while sham stimuli were delivered at control location, SH1. Acupuncture produced activation in S2, insula, and mid-cingulate cortex, and deactivation in default mode network (DMN) areas. On average, HR deceleration (HR-) and SCR were noted following both real and sham acupuncture, though magnitude of response was greater following real acupuncture and inter-subject magnitude of response correlated with evoked sensation intensity. Acupuncture events with strong SCR also produced greater anterior insula activation than without SCR. Moreover, acupuncture at SP9, which produced greater SCR, also produced stronger sharp pain sensation, and greater anterior insula activation. Conversely, acupuncture-induced HR- was associated with greater DMN deactivation. Between-event correlation demonstrated that this association was strongest for ST36, which also produced more robust HR-. In fact, DMN deactivation was significantly more pronounced across acupuncture stimuli producing HR-, versus those events characterized by acceleration (HR+). Thus, differential brain response underlying acupuncture stimuli may be related to differential autonomic outflows and may result from heterogeneity in evoked sensations. Our er-fMRI approach suggests that ANS response to acupuncture, consistent with previously characterized orienting and startle/defense responses, arises from activity within distinct subregions of the more general brain circuitry responding to acupuncture stimuli.

However, little is known about structural brain abnormalities that may differentiate ADHD patients with and without comorbid SUD. We compared regional grey matter volumes of 10 non-medicated male ADHD patients with comorbid cocaine dependence, 14 non-medicated male ADHD patients without cocaine dependence and 15 healthy control participants matched for age and premorbid intellectual functioning, using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) using both a whole-brain analysis and a priori ROI analysis based on the existing ADHD VBM literature. In a whole brain analysis, ADHD patients with and without cocaine dependence showed smaller volumes in the right putamen and cerebellum compared to healthy controls. In addition, ADHD patients without cocaine dependence showed larger volumes in the midbrain and in the precentral gyrus compared to healthy control participants and larger volumes in the occipital cortex compared to ADHD patients with comorbid cocaine dependence. A direct comparison using the a priori defined ROI approach showed that ADHD patients with cocaine dependence had smaller putamen volumes than ADHD patients without cocaine dependence. ADHD patients with cocaine dependence show more profound grey matter volume reductions in the striatum compared to ADHD patients without cocaine dependence. Possible implications for treatment are discussed. ",
pmid_18004945,Functional magnetic resonance imaging evidence for abnormalities in response selection in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: differences in activation associated with response inhibition but not habitual motor response.,,"Impaired response inhibition is thought to be a core deficit in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Prior imaging studies investigating response inhibition in children with ADHD have used tasks involving different cognitive resources, thereby complicating the interpretation of their findings. In this study, a classical go/no-go task with a well-ingrained stimulus-response association (green = go; red = no-go) was used in order to minimize extraneous cognitive demands. Twenty-five children with ADHD and 25 typically developing (TD) children between the ages of 8 and 13 years and group-matched for IQ and performance on the go/no-go task were studied using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Analyses were used to examine differences in activation between the ADHD and TD groups for ""go"" (habitual motor response) and ""no-go"" (requiring inhibition of the motor response) events. Region-of-interest analyses revealed no between-group difference in activation in association with ""go"" events. For ""no-go"" events, the children with ADHD demonstrated significantly less activation than did TD controls within a network important for inhibiting a motor response to a visual stimulus, with frontal differences localized to the pre-supplementary motor area. Although blood oxygenation level-dependent fMRI data show no differences between children with ADHD and TD children in association with a habituated motor ""go"" response, during ""no-go"" events, which require selecting not to respond, children with ADHD show diminished recruitment of networks important for response inhibition. The findings suggest that abnormalities in circuits important for motor response selection contribute to deficits in response inhibition in children with ADHD and lend support to the growing awareness of ADHD-associated anomalies in medial frontal regions important for the control of voluntary actions.

pmid_22037936,Neural correlates of pathological gamblers preference for immediate rewards during the iowa gambling task: an fMRI study.,,"The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) involves exploratory learning via rewards and penalties, where most advantageous task performance requires subjects to forego potential large immediate rewards for small longer-term rewards to avoid larger punishments. Pathological gambling (PG) subjects perform worse on the IGT compared to controls, relating to their persistence at high risk decisions involving the continued choice of potential large immediate rewards despite experiencing larger punishments. We wished to determine if neural processing of risk and reward within striatal and frontal cortex is associated with this behaviour observed in PG. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to assess brain activity in response to a computerized version of the IGT. Thirteen male PG subjects with no active comorbidities were compared to 13 demographically matched control subjects. In agreement with previous behavioural studies, PG subjects performed worse on the IGT and made more high-risk choices compared to controls, particularly after experiencing wins and losses. During high-risk gambling decisions, fMRI demonstrated that PG subjects exhibited relatively increased frontal lobe and basal ganglia activation, particularly involving the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), caudate and amygdala. Increased activation of regions encompassing the extended reward pathway in PG subjects during high risk choices suggests that the persistence of PG may be due to the increased salience of immediate and greater potential monetary rewards relative to lower monetary rewards or potential future losses. Whether this over activation of the reward pathway is associated with the development of PG warrants further investigation. ",

The control group exhibited activation of the right supplement motor area (SMA), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and caudate for response inhibition. However, the IGD group had a higher impulsivity and lower activity of the right SMA/pre-SMA in comparison to the control group.

Forty-four individuals with schizophrenia, 36 with HFA and 41 non-clinical controls completed a battery of social cognitive measures that have been linked previously to specific brain regions. The results indicate that the individuals with schizophrenia and HFA were both impaired on a variety of social cognitive tasks relative to the non-clinical controls, but did not differ from one another. When individuals with schizophrenia were divided into negative symptom and paranoid subgroups, exploratory analyses revealed that individuals with HFA may be more similar, in terms of the pattern of social cognition impairments, to the negative symptom group than to the paranoia group. Our findings provide further support for similarities in social cognition deficits between HFA and schizophrenia, which have a variety of implications for future work on gene-brain-behavior relationships.

We aimed to clarify the issue by comparing rsFCs of each cingulate subregion between healthy controls and schizophrenia patients. A total of 102 healthy controls and 94 schizophrenia patients underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging with a sensitivity-encoded spiral-in imaging sequence to reduce susceptibility-induced signal loss and distortion. The cingulate cortex was divided into nine subregions, including the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), areas 24 and 32 of the pregenual ACC, areas 24 and 32 of the anterior mid-cingulate cortex (aMCC), posterior MCC (pMCC), dorsal (dPCC) and ventral (vPCC) posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC). The rsFCs of each cingulate subregion were compared between the two groups and the atrophy effect was considered. Results with and without global signal regression were reported. Most cingulate subregions exhibited decreased rsFCs in schizophrenia after global signal regression (GSR). Without GSR, only increased rsFC was found in schizophrenia, which primarily restricted to the aMCC, PCC and RSC. Some of these increased rsFCs were also significant after GSR. These findings suggest that GSR can greatly affect between-group differences in rsFCs and the consistently increased rsFCs may challenge the functional disconnection hypothesis of schizophrenia. ",

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 3 Tesla on 20 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients with minimal frontal cognitive dysfunction and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Resting-state network maps were extracted with independent component analysis and group-level statistical analyses were performed to detect disease and disease-by-age interaction effects. Whole-brain global and regional atrophy measures were obtained from same-session structural scans. The sensori-motor network showed significant disease effects, with signals suppressed in patients bilaterally in the primary motor cortex. The default-mode network showed a significant disease-by-age interaction in the posterior cingulate cortex, where signals correlated with age positively in patients and negatively in controls. Both disease and disease-by-age interaction effects were detected in the right fronto-parietal network. Although global atrophy did not show significant differences, regions of reduced gray matter volume were detected in patients compared with controls adjacent to regions of reduced functional connectivity. Our results confirm that resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging signals in the sensori-motor network are suppressed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A similar suppression is evident in the right fronto-parietal network, possibly reflecting the patients' frontal dysfunction and right-lateralized patterns of regional atrophy. The interaction between disease and aging in the default-mode network unravels a possible mechanism of compensation between motor and extramotor systems emerging as a supplementary functional push to help motor disturbances.

Prefrontal cortex
fMRI","Previous studies have shown that affective symptoms are part of the clinical picture in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common motor neuron disorder in elderly people. Diffuse neurodegeneration of limbic regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex [PFC], amygdala) was demonstrated in ALS post-mortem, although the mechanisms of emotional dysregulation in ALS in vivo remain unclear. Using functional imaging, we assessed the brain responses to emotional faces in 11 cognitively unimpaired ALS patients and 12 healthy controls (HCs). We tested whether regional activities and connectivity patterns in the limbic system differed between ALS patients and HCs and whether the variability in clinical measures modulated the neuroimaging data. Relative to HCs, ALS patients displayed greater activation in a series of PFC areas and altered left amygdala-PFC connectivity. Anxiety modulated the right amygdala-PFC connectivity in HCs but not in ALS patients. Reduced right premotor cortex activity and altered left amygdala-supplementary motor area connectivity were associated with longer disease duration and greater disease severity, respectively. Our findings demonstrate dysfunctions of the limbic system in ALS patients at early stages of the disease, and extend our knowledge about the interplay between emotional brain areas and the regions traditionally implicated in motor control.

Different cerebro-cerebellar circuits may be engaged for integrating aurally- and visually-presented information for VWM. The present fMRI study investigated load (2, 4, or 6 letters) and modality (auditory and visual) dependent cerebro-cerebellar VWM activation using a Sternberg task. FMRI revealed modality-independent activations in left frontal (BA 6/9/44), insular, cingulate (BA 32), and bilateral inferior parietal/supramarginal (BA 40) regions, as well as in bilateral superior (HVI) and right inferior (HVIII) cerebellar regions. Visual presentation evoked prominent activations in right superior (HVI/CrusI) cerebellum, bilateral occipital (BA19) and left parietal (BA7/40) cortex while auditory presentation showed robust activations predominantly in bilateral temporal regions (BA21/22). In the cerebellum, we noted a visual to auditory emphasis of function progressing from superior to inferior and from lateral to medial regions. These results extend our previous findings of fMRI activation in cerebro-cerebellar networks during VWM, and demonstrate both modality dependent commonalities and differences in activations with increasing memory load.

pmid_15607294,Abnormal neural responses to emotional visual stimuli in adolescents with conduct disorder.,,"It is widely held that aggression and antisocial behavior arise as a consequence of a deficiency in responding to emotional cues in the social environment. We asked whether neural responses evoked by affect-laden pictures would be abnormal in adolescents with conduct disorder (CD). Functional magnetic resonance imaging during passive viewing of pictures with neutral or strong negative affective valence was performed in 13 male adolescents with severe CD aged 9 to 15 years and in 14 healthy age-matched control subjects. Main effects for negative-neutral affective valence included activations in the amygdala and hippocampus, ventral extrastriate visual cortex, and intraparietal sulcus bilaterally. There was a significant group-by-condition interaction in the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex that was due to a pronounced deactivation in the patient group during viewing of negative pictures. When correcting for anxiety and depressive symptoms, we additionally found a reduced responsiveness of the left amygdala to negative pictures in patients compared with control subjects. We suggest that these findings reflect an impairment of both the recognition of emotional stimuli and the cognitive control of emotional behavior in patients with CD, resulting in a propensity for aggressive behavior.

pmid_23936504,Decreased interhemispheric coordination in treatment-resistant depression: a resting-state fMRI study.,,"Previous studies have demonstrated that patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and treatment-sensitive depression (TSD) differed at neural level. However, it remains unclear if these two subtypes of depression differ in the interhemispheric coordination. This study was undertaken for two purposes: (1) to explore the differences in interhemispheric coordination between these two subtypes by using the voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) method; and (2) to determine if the difference of interhemispheric coordination can be used as a biomarker(s) to differentiate TRD from both TSD and healthy subjects (HS). Twenty-three patients with TRD, 22 with TSD, and 19 HS participated in the study. Data of these participants were analyzed with the VMHC and seed-based functional connectivity (FC) approaches. Compared to the TSD group, the TRD group showed significantly lower VMHC values in the calcarine cortex, fusiform gyrus, hippocampus, superior temporal gyrus, middle cingulum, and precentral gyrus. Lower VMHC values were also observed in the TRD group in the calcarine cortex relative to the HS group. However, the TSD group had no significant change in VMHC value in any brain region compared to the HS group. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) analysis revealed that the VMHC values in the calcarine cortex had discriminatory function distinguishing patients with TRD from patients with TSD as well as those participants in the HS group. Lower VMHC values of patients with TRD relative to those with TSD and those in the HS group in the calcarine cortex appeared to be a unique feature for patients with TRD and it may be used as an imaging biomarker to separate patients with TRD from those with TSD or HS.

Intervention
fMRI","Internet gaming disorder (IGD) is characterized by high levels of craving for online gaming and related cues. Since addiction-related cues can evoke increased activation in brain areas involved in motivational and reward processing and may engender gaming behaviors or trigger relapse, ameliorating cue-induced craving may be a promising target for interventions for IGD. This study compared neural activation between 40 IGD and 19 healthy control (HC) subjects during an Internet-gaming cue-reactivity task and found that IGD subjects showed stronger activation in multiple brain areas, including the dorsal striatum, brainstem, substantia nigra, and anterior cingulate cortex, but lower activation in the posterior insula. Furthermore, twenty-three IGD subjects (CBI + group) participated in a craving behavioral intervention (CBI) group therapy, whereas the remaining 17 IGD subjects (CBI - group) did not receive any intervention, and all IGD subjects were scanned during similar time intervals. The CBI + group showed decreased IGD severity and cue-induced craving, enhanced activation in the anterior insula and decreased insular connectivity with the lingual gyrus and precuneus after receiving CBI. These findings suggest that CBI is effective in reducing craving and severity in IGD, and it may exert its effects by altering insula activation and its connectivity with regions involved in visual processing and attention bias.

pmid_23779051,Sleep restriction increases the neuronal response to unhealthy food in normal-weight individuals.,,"Sleep restriction alters responses to food. However, the underlying neural mechanisms for this effect are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a neural system that is preferentially activated in response to unhealthy compared with healthy foods. Twenty-five normal-weight individuals, who normally slept 7-9 h per night, completed both phases of this randomized controlled study. Each participant was tested after a period of five nights of either 4 or 9 h in bed. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed in the fasted state, presenting healthy and unhealthy food stimuli and objects in a block design. Neuronal responses to unhealthy, relative to healthy food stimuli after each sleep period were assessed and compared. After a period of restricted sleep, viewing unhealthy foods led to greater activation in the superior and middle temporal gyri, middle and superior frontal gyri, left inferior parietal lobule, orbitofrontal cortex, and right insula compared with healthy foods. These same stimuli presented after a period of habitual sleep did not produce marked activity patterns specific to unhealthy foods. Further, food intake during restricted sleep increased in association with a relative decrease in brain oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activity observed in the right insula. This inverse relationship between insula activity and food intake and enhanced activation in brain reward and food-sensitive centers in response to unhealthy foods provides a model of neuronal mechanisms relating short sleep duration to obesity.

Direct comparisons between opaque and transparent words revealed increased activity in left BA44/45, and BA44/6 as well as bilateral activation near BA 47/insula and the anterior cingulate gyrus. These results reveal activity in areas previously found to be devoted to articulation of the determiner and to morphological processing. Taken together they support the notion that gender decisions for opaque items requires deeper and more effortful processing during the retrieval of lexical and syntactic information. ",

reward","Individuals with addictive disorders are usually characterized by impaired executive control, persistent craving and excessive reward-seeking. However, it is unclear whether there is a deviation in the connection pattern among the neural systems implicated in these problem behaviors. One hundred thirty-six online gaming players were recruited in the current study (68 Internet gaming disorder (IGD) subjects and 68 recreational game users (RGUs) who served as controls matched on age, sex, years of education, and years of gaming). Dynamic interactions among the reward system (striatum), control system (prefrontal cortex), and the interoceptive awareness system (insula) were calculated and compared when subjects were facing gaming cues. The results revealed that RGUs showed a significant positive correlation in the putamen-middle frontal gyrus (MFG)-insula neural pathway when facing gaming cues, which was missing in the IGD subjects. Additionally, dynamic causal modeling (DCM) analysis revealed that the MFG region was more inhibited by the putamen in the IGD subjects relative to the RGUs. These findings suggest that the inhibitory neuromodulation of the putamen to the prefrontal cortex in IGD individuals undermines the balance among the tripartite systems. Our findings provide novel neurobiological evidence for understanding the internal connection bias of the addicted individual's neural system and how the addictive disorder impairs executive control; consequently, the pathway from the striatum to the prefrontal cortex may serve as a potential biomarker to predict the risk of developing an addiction.

Preliminary findings.,,"This study investigated the potential long-term effects of cocaine exposure on brain functioning using fMRI in school-aged children. The sample included 12 children with prenatal cocaine exposure and 12 non-exposed children (8-9 years old). Groups did not differ on IQ, socioeconomic status, or perinatal risk factors. A response inhibition task was administered during an fMRI scan using a 1.5-T MRI system. Task performance did not differentiate groups, but groups were differentiated by patterns of task-related brain activity. Cocaine-exposed children showed greater activation in the right inferior frontal cortex and caudate during response inhibition, whereas non-exposed children showed greater activations in temporal and occipital regions. These preliminary findings suggest that prenatal cocaine may affect the development of brain systems involved in the regulation of attention and response inhibition. ",
pmid_23166657,Working memory-related functional brain patterns in never medicated children with ADHD.,,"Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by 3 clusters of age-inappropriate cardinal symptoms: inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. These clinical/behavioural symptoms are assumed to result from disturbances within brain systems supporting executive functions including working memory (WM), which refers to the ability to transiently store and flexibly manipulate task-relevant information. Ongoing or past medications, co-morbidity and differences in task performance are potential, independent confounds in assessing the integrity of cerebral patterns in ADHD. In the present study, we recorded WM-related cerebral activity during a memory updating N-back task using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in control children and never medicated, prepubescent children with ADHD but without comorbid symptoms. Despite similar updating performance than controls, children with ADHD exhibited decreased, below baseline WM-related activation levels in a widespread cortico-subcortical network encompassing bilateral occipital and inferior parietal areas, caudate nucleus, cerebellum and functionally connected brainstem nuclei. Distinctive functional connectivity patterns were also found in the ADHD in these regions, with a tighter coupling in the updating than in the control condition with a distributed WM-related cerebral network. Especially, cerebellum showed tighter coupling with activity in an area compatible with the brainstem red nucleus. These results in children with clinical core symptoms of ADHD but without comorbid affections and never treated with medication yield evidence for a core functional neuroanatomical network subtending WM-related processes in ADHD, which may participate to the pathophysiology and expression of clinical symptoms.

pmid_22294427,Decreased intrinsic brain connectivity is associated with reduced clinical pain in fibromyalgia.,,"A major impediment to the development of novel treatment strategies for fibromyalgia (FM) is the lack of an objective marker that reflects spontaneously reported clinical pain in patients with FM. Studies of resting-state intrinsic brain connectivity in FM have demonstrated increased insular connectivity to the default mode network (DMN), a network whose activity is increased during nontask states. Moreover, increased insular connectivity to the DMN was associated with increased spontaneous pain levels. However, as these analyses were cross-sectional in nature, they provided no insight into dynamic changes in connectivity or their relationship to variations in self-reported clinical pain. The purpose of this study was to evaluate longitudinal changes in the intrinsic brain connectivity of FM patients treated with nonpharmacologic interventions known to modulate pain levels in this patient population, and to test the hypothesis that the reduction of DMN-insula connectivity following therapy would correlate with diminished pain. Seventeen FM patients underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and following 4 weeks of a nonpharmacologic intervention to diminish pain. Intrinsic DMN connectivity was evaluated using probabilistic independent components analysis. Longitudinal changes in intrinsic DMN connectivity were evaluated by paired analysis, and correlations between longitudinal changes in clinical pain and changes in intrinsic DMN connectivity were investigated by multiple linear regression analysis. Changes in clinical pain were assessed with the short form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ). Clinical pain as assessed using the sensory scale of the SF-MPQ was reduced following therapy (P=0.02). Intrinsic DMN connectivity to the insula was reduced, and this reduction correlated with reductions in pain (corrected P<0.05). Our findings suggest that intrinsic brain connectivity can be used as a candidate objective marker that reflects changes in spontaneous chronic pain within individual FM patients. We propose that intrinsic connectivity measures could potentially be used in either research or clinical settings as a complementary, more objective outcome measure for use in FM. ",
pmid_18294820,An fMRI study of the interface between affective and cognitive neural circuitry in pediatric bipolar disorder.,,"The pathophysiology of pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) impacts both affective and cognitive brain systems. Understanding disturbances in the neural circuits subserving these abilities is critical for characterizing developmental aberrations associated with the disorder and developing improved treatments. Our objective is to use functional neuroimaging with pediatric bipolar disorder patients employing a task that probes the functional integrity of attentional control and affect processing. Ten euthymic unmedicated pediatric bipolar patients and healthy controls matched for age, sex, race, socioeconomic status, and IQ were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging. In a pediatric color word matching paradigm, subjects were asked to match the color of a word with one of two colored circles below. Words had a positive, negative or neutral emotional valence, and were presented in 30-s blocks. In the negative affect condition, relative to the neutral condition, patients with bipolar disorder demonstrated greater activation of bilateral pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and left amygdala, and less activation in right rostral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dorsolateral PFC at the junction of the middle frontal and inferior frontal gyri. In the positive affect condition, there was no reduced activation of PFC or increased amygdala activation. The pattern of reduced activation of ventrolateral PFC and greater amygdala activation in bipolar children in response to negative stimuli suggests both disinhibition of emotional reactivity in the limbic system and reduced function in PFC systems that regulate those responses. Higher cortical cognitive areas such as the dorsolateral PFC may also be adversely affected by exaggerated emotional responsivity to negative emotions. This pattern of functional alteration in affective and cognitive circuitry may contribute to the reduced capacity for affect regulation and behavioral self-control in pediatric bipolar disorder. ",

voxel-based morphometry","Reduced executive control is one of the central components of model on the development and maintenance of Internet gaming disorder (IGD). Among the various executive control problems, high impulsivity has consistently been associated with IGD. We performed voxel-based morphometric analysis with diffeomorphic anatomical registration by using an exponentiated Lie algebra algorithm (DARTEL) to investigate the relationship of gray matter abnormalities to impulsivity in IGD. Thirty-one young male adults whose excessive Internet gaming began in early adolescence, and 30 age-matched male healthy controls were examined. IGD subjects showed smaller gray matter volume (GMV) in brain regions implicated in executive control, such as the anterior cingulate cortex and the supplementary motor area. The GMVs in the anterior cingulate cortex and the supplementary motor area were negatively correlated with self-reporting scales of impulsiveness. IGD subjects also exhibited smaller GMV in lateral prefrontal and parietal cortices comprising the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the left inferior parietal lobule when compared with healthy controls. The GMVs in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex were negatively correlated with lifetime usage of Internet gaming. These findings suggest that gray matter abnormalities in areas related to executive control may contribute to high impulsivity of young adults with IGD. Furthermore, alterations in the prefrontal cortex were related with long-term excessive Internet gaming during adolescence. ",

Male sex","Difficulty in anger control and anger-related aggressive outbursts against others are frequently reported by patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Although male sex is a known predictor for aggression, hardly any study has addressed the neural correlates of deficient anger control in male patients with BPD. Building on previous reports in female BPD, we investigated the involvement of lateral antero- and dorsal prefrontal cortex in the control of fast emotional actions and its relation to self-reported tendencies to act out anger. 15 medication-free male patients with BPD and 25 age- and intelligence-matched healthy men took part in a social Approach-Avoidance task in the MR-scanner. This task allows the measurement of neural correlates underlying the control of fast behavioral tendencies to approach happy and avoid angry faces. Hypothesis-driven region-of-interest and exploratory whole brain analyses were used to test for activations of antero- and dorsolateral prefrontal regions and their relation with the amygdala during emotional action control as well as their association with self-reported anger out in male patients with BPD and healthy volunteers. Male patients with BPD showed reduced anterolateral prefrontal activations during emotional action control compared to healthy volunteers. Furthermore, anger out was negatively related to antero- and dorsolateral prefrontal activations, while it was positively related to amygdala activity in male patients with BPD. The current results suggest the involvement of antero- and dorsolateral prefrontal regions in controlling and overriding fast emotional actions. Deficits in lateral prefrontal emotion control seem to be a common neural mechanism underlying anger-related aggression. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'Current status of the neurobiology of aggression and impulsivity'. ",

This study aimed to investigate the in situ immune response profile and mechanisms of neuronal cell damage in fatal Zika microcephaly cases. Brain tissue samples were collected from 15 cases, including 10 microcephalic ZIKV-positive neonates with fatal outcome and five neonatal control flavivirus-negative neonates that died due to other causes, but with preserved central nervous system (CNS) architecture. In microcephaly cases, the histopathological features of the tissue samples were characterized in three CNS areas (meninges, perivascular space, and parenchyma). The changes found were mainly calcification, necrosis, neuronophagy, gliosis, microglial nodules, and inflammatory infiltration of mononuclear cells. The in situ immune response against ZIKV in the CNS of newborns is complex. Despite the predominant expression of Th2 cytokines, other cytokines such as Th1, Th17, Treg, Th9, and Th22 are involved to a lesser extent, but are still likely to participate in the immunopathogenic mechanisms of neural disease in fatal cases of microcephaly caused by ZIKV.

MRI data were acquired from 30 patients with ALS and 30 age-matched healthy controls. For each subject, 85 grey matter regions (network nodes) were identified from high resolution structural MRI, and network connections formed from the white matter tracts generated by diffusion MRI and probabilistic tractography. Whole-brain networks were constructed using strong constraints on anatomical plausibility and a weighting reflecting tract-averaged fractional anisotropy (FA). Analysis using Network-based Statistics (NBS), without a priori selected regions, identified an impaired motor-frontal-subcortical subnetwork (10 nodes and 12 bidirectional connections), consistent with upper motor neuron pathology, in the ALS group compared with the controls (P = 0.020). Reduced FA in three of the impaired network connections, which involved fibers of the corticospinal tract, correlated with rate of disease progression (P ≤ 0.024). A novel network-tract comparison revealed that the connections involved in the affected network had a strong correspondence (mean overlap of 86.2%) with white matter tracts identified as having reduced FA compared with the control group using TBSS. These findings suggest that white matter degeneration in ALS is strongly linked to the motor cortex, and that impaired structural networks identified using NBS have a strong correspondence to affected white matter tracts identified using more conventional voxel-based methods.

pmid_21572088,Resting-state functional connectivity of the medial superior frontal cortex.,,"The medial superior frontal cortex (SFC), including the supplementary motor area (SMA) and presupplementary motor area (preSMA), is implicated in movement and cognitive control, among other functions central to decision making. Previous studies delineated the anatomical boundaries and functional connectivity of the SMA. However, it is unclear whether the preSMA, which responds to a variety of behavioral tasks, comprises functionally distinct areas. With 24 seed regions systematically demarcated throughout the anterior and posterior medial SFC, we examined here the functional divisions of the medial SFC on the basis of the ""correlograms"" of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 225 adult individuals. In addition to replicating segregation of the SMA and posterior preSMA, the current results elucidated functional connectivities of anterior preSMA-the most anterior part of the medial SFC. In contrast to the caudal medial SFC, the anterior preSMA is connected with most of the prefrontal but not with somatomotor areas. Overall, the SMA is strongly connected to the thalamus and epithalamus, the posterior preSMA to putamen, pallidum, and subthalamic nucleus, and anterior preSMA to the caudate, with the caudate showing significant hemispheric asymmetry. These findings may provide a useful platform for future studies to investigate frontal cortical functions. ",
pmid_11034858,Dissociation of mechanisms underlying syllogistic reasoning.,,"A key question for cognitive theories of reasoning is whether logical reasoning is inherently a sentential linguistic process or a process requiring spatial manipulation and search. We addressed this question in an event-related fMRI study of syllogistic reasoning, using sentences with and without semantic content. Our findings indicate involvement of two dissociable networks in deductive reasoning. During content-based reasoning a left hemisphere temporal system was recruited. By contrast, a formally identical reasoning task, which lacked semantic content, activated a parietal system. The two systems share common components in bilateral basal ganglia nuclei, right cerebellum, bilateral fusiform gyri, and left prefrontal cortex. We conclude that syllogistic reasoning is implemented in two distinct systems whose engagement is primarily a function of the presence or absence of semantic content. Furthermore, when a logical argument results in a belief-logic conflict, the nature of the reasoning process is changed by recruitment of the right prefrontal cortex. ",
pmid_15050573,Differential neural responses to overt and covert presentations of facial expressions of fear and disgust.,,"There is debate in cognitive neuroscience whether conscious versus unconscious processing represents a categorical or a quantitative distinction. The purpose of the study was to explore this matter using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We first established objective thresholds of the critical temporal parameters for overt and covert presentations of fear and disgust. Next we applied these stimulus parameters in an fMRI experiment to determine whether non-consciously perceived (covert) facial expressions of fear and disgust show the same double dissociation (amygdala response to fear, insula to disgust) observed with consciously perceived (overt) stimuli. A backward masking paradigm was used. In the psychophysics experiment, the following parameters were established: 30-ms target duration for the covert condition, and 170-ms target duration for the overt condition. Results of the block-design fMRI study indicated substantial differences underlying the perception of fearful and disgusted facial expressions, with significant effects of both emotion and target duration. Findings for the overt condition (170 ms) confirm previous evidence of amygdala activation to fearful faces, and insula activation to disgusted faces, and a double dissociation between these two emotions. In the covert condition (30 ms), the amygdala was not activated to fear, nor was the insula activated to disgust. Overall, findings demonstrate significant differences between the neural responses to fear and to disgust, and between the covert presentations of these two emotions. These results therefore suggest distinct neural correlates of conscious and unconscious emotion perception. ",

The validity of preexisting studies needs to be confirmed through replication studies, which there is a lack of. So far, most replication studies have been conducted on non-patients (NP) and primarily investigated cognitive and motor tasks. To fill this gap, we conducted the first fMRI replication study to investigate brain function using disease-related food stimuli in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN). Using fMRI, we investigated 31 AN patients and 27 NP for increased amygdala and reduced midcingulate activation when viewing food and non-food stimuli, as reported by the original study (11AN, 11NP; Joos et al., 2011). Similar to the previous study, we observed in the within group comparisons (food>non-food) a frontoinsular activation for both groups. Although in AN the recorded activation clustered more prominently and extended into the cingulate cortex. In the between-group comparisons, the increased amygdala and reduced midcingulate activation could not be replicated. Instead, AN showed a higher activation of the cingulate cortices, the pre-/postcentral gyrus and the inferior parietal lobe. Unlike in the initial study, no significant differences between NP>AN could be observed. The inconsistency of results and the non-replication of the study could have several reasons, such as high inter-individual variance of functional correlates of emotion processing, as well as intra-individual variances and the smaller group size of the initial study. These results underline the importance of replication for assessing the reliability and validity of results from fMRI research. ",

Impairments in executive function (EF) are widely considered to exacerbate memory deficits and to increase the risk of conversion from aMCI to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the specific mechanisms underlying the interaction between executive dysfunction and memory deficits in aMCI patients remain unclear. Thus, the present study utilized resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of the EF network and the EM network to investigate this relationship in 79 aMCI patients and 119 healthy controls (HC). The seeds were obtained from the results of a regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis. Functional connectivity (FC) within the EM network was determined using a seed in the right retrosplenial cortex (RSC), and FC within EF network was assessed using seeds in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). There was a significant negative correlation between EM scores and EF scores in both the aMCI and HC groups. Compared to the HC group, aMCI patients had reduced right RSC connectivity but enhanced right DLPFC connectivity. The overlapping brain regions between the EM and EF networks were associated with FC in the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in the right RSC network, and in the bilateral middle cingulate cortex (MCC) and left IPL in the right DLPFC network. A mediation analysis revealed that the EF network had an indirect positive effect on EM performance in the aMCI patients. The present findings provide new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the interaction between impaired EF and memory deficits in aMCI patients and suggest that the EF network may mediate EM performance in this population.

In DS patients, ALFF in the right insula was significantly increased than in controls and positively correlated with S2-P50 amplitude of sensory gating P50. ALFF in the left cerebellum posterior lobe negatively correlated with negative symptoms and withdrawn on PANSS (PANSS-NS, PANSS-WIT), ALFF in the right putamen positively correlated with PANSS-WIT. In NDS patients, ALFF in the middle temporal gyrus decreased than in controls and negatively correlated with P3b subcomponent of P300 latency. ALFF in the left cerebellum posterior lobe negatively correlated with PANSS-EXC/ACT. The middle temporal gyrus in NDS or the right insula in DS may show spatiotemporal defects. ",
pmid_17468013,Cerebellar contributions to working memory.,,"Anatomical studies show the existence of two well-characterized cortico-cerebellar 'loops' that connect prefrontal and cortical motor areas each with their own modules in the cerebellar cortex. The involvement of the cerebellar 'motor' modules in motor skills is well established, but little is understood about the way that cerebellar prefrontal modules process information from the prefrontal cortex. This question is particularly important for understanding the human cortico-cerebellar system because the prefrontal loop appears to have expanded significantly during the course of evolution. Here, we investigate whether cerebellar modules known to be connected with the prefrontal cortex (specifically within cerebellar cortical lobule VII) become engaged by the execution of skilled cognitive operations. We tested the anatomically specific hypothesis that this area would be activated by the skilled maintenance and manipulation of items within verbal working memory. We used the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) in combination with a sparse sampling method to avoid artefact caused by speech-related head movement on the BOLD timecourse. Consistent with our hypothesis, we report that activity in the experimental condition was evoked in medial portions of cerebellar cortical lobule VII (relative to a closely matched control task). As would be anticipated, the motor demands common to experimental and control tasks activated face areas of the motor cortex as well as connected motor areas of the cerebellar cortex. We discuss this evidence in the context of theories of cortico-cerebellar information processing. ",
pmid_20174930,Route and survey processing of topographical memory during navigation.,,"We investigated the characteristics of route and survey processing of a unique complex virtual environment both at the behavioral and brain levels. Prior to fMRI scanning, participants were trained to follow a route and to learn the spatial relationships between several places, acquiring both route and survey knowledge from a ground-level perspective. During scanning, snapshots of the environment were presented, and participants were required to either indicate the direction to take to follow the route (route task), or to locate unseen targets (survey task). Data suggest that route and survey processing are mainly supported by a common occipito-fronto-parieto-temporal neural network. Our results are consistent with those gathered in studies concerning the neural bases of route versus survey knowledge acquired either from different perspectives or in different environments. However, rather than arguing for a clear distinction between route and survey processing, ""mixed"" strategies are likely to be involved when both types of encoding take place in the same environment.

Obsessive–compulsive disorder
Regional homogeneity
Spontaneous brain activity","Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Several neuroimaging studies have explored alterations of brain function in OCD patients as they performed tasks after CBT. However, the effects of CBT on the neural activityin OCD during rest remain unknown. Therefore, we investigated changes in regional homogeneity (ReHo) in OCD patients before and after CBT. Twenty-two OCD patients and 22 well-matched healthy controls participated in the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. We compared differences in ReHo between the OCD and control groups before treatment and investigated the changes of ReHo in 17 OCD patients who responded to CBT. Compared to healthy controls, OCD patients exhibited higher ReHo in the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), bilateral middle frontal cortex, right precuneus, left cerebellum, and vermis, as well as lower ReHo in the bilateral caudate, right calcarine, right posterior cingulate cortex, and right middle temporal cortex. Along with the clinical improvement in OCD patients after CBT, we found decreased ReHo in the right OFC, bilateral middle frontal cortex, left cerebellum and vermis, and increased ReHo in the left caudate. Improvement of OCD symptoms was significantly correlated with the changed ReHo in the right OFC and left cerebellum. Although these findings are preliminary and need to be replicated in larger samples, they indicate the presence of abnormal spontaneous brain activity of the prefrontal-striatal-cerebellar circuit in OCD patients, and provide evidence that CBT can selectively modulate the spontaneous brain activity of this circuit in OCD patients.

pmid_26430731,Compromised Prefrontal Cognitive Control Over Emotional Interference in Adolescents with Internet Gaming Disorder.,,"Increased reports of impulsivity and aggression in male adolescents with Internet gaming might reflect their dysfunction in emotion regulation, particularly in suppression of negative emotions, which should affect the various stages of Internet gaming disorder. This study tested the hypothesis that adolescents with Internet gaming disorder would be more disturbed by the emotional interference and demonstrate compromised dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activation during a Stroop Match-to-Sample task. In addition, functional connectivity analysis was conducted to examine the interplays between neural correlates involved in emotional processing and how they were altered in adolescents with Internet gaming disorder. The Internet gaming disorder group demonstrated weaker dACC activation and stronger insular activations to interfering angry facial stimuli compared with the healthy control group. Negative functional connectivity between stronger insular activation and weaker dorsolateral prefrontal activation correlated with higher cognitive impulsivity in adolescents with Internet gaming disorder. These findings provide evidence of the compromised prefrontal cognitive control over emotional interference in adolescents with Internet gaming disorder. ",
pmid_19242292,An fMRI study of the neural correlates of incidental versus directed emotion processing in pediatric bipolar disorder.,,"To use functional neuroimaging to probe the affective circuitry dysfunctions underlying disturbances in emotion processing and emotional reactivity in pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD). Equal numbers of controls (HC) and unmedicated patients with euthymia and PBD were matched for age, sex, race, socioeconomic status, and IQ (n = 10 per group; mean age 14.2 years [SD 2.0 years]). The task consisted of a ""directed"" emotion processing condition where subjects judged whether emotion in facial expression was positive or negative and an ""incidental"" condition where subjects judged whether faces expressing similar affect were older or younger than 35 years. Relative to the directed condition, the incidental condition elicited greater activation in the right amygdala and the right insula, the left middle frontal gyrus, and the left posterior cingulate cortex in patients with PBD, in contrast to the HC that showed greater activation in the right superior frontal gyrus. In both incidental and directed conditions, relative to visual fixation, patients with PBD showed less activation in the right prefrontal cortex (superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyri) and the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and greater activation in the posterior visual and face-processing regions (i.e., right precuneus/cuneus, fusiform gyrus). Increased amygdala activation observed in patients with PBD elicited by incidental emotional processing relative to directed emotional processing may indicate more intense automatic emotional reactivity. Furthermore, the right prefrontal systems that are believed to modulate affect seem to be less engaged in patients with PBD regardless of whether the emotion processing is incidental or directed, which may signify reduced top-down control of emotional reactivity in PBD.

pmid_12355013,Alzheimer Disease: evaluation of a functional MR imaging index as a marker.,,"To measure changes in functional synchrony in the hippocampus in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD). Three subject groups (nine cognitively healthy elderly control subjects, 10 patients with probable AD, and five subjects with MCI) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for measurement of functional synchrony in the hippocampus. Functional synchrony was defined and quantified as the mean of the cross-correlation coefficients of spontaneous low frequency (COSLOF) components between possible pairs of voxel time courses in a brain region, or the COSLOF index. The two-tailed Student t test was used to determine differences in the COSLOF index between the control group, the probable AD group, and the MCI group. An operating characteristic curve was calculated to graphically depict the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity of the COSLOF index. Functional synchrony quantified with the COSLOF index was obtained in AD, MCI, and control subjects. COSLOF index values were significantly lower in AD patients than in control subjects (t = 4.32, P <.0012). For MCI subjects, COSLOF index values were significantly higher than those of AD patients (t = -2.4052, P <.047) but significantly lower than those of control subjects (t = 2.257, P <.043). The exponential-class curve significantly fits the relationship between the COSLOF index and the Mini-Mental Status Examination score (chi(2) = 20.4), indicating the rapid decrease in cognitive capacity below a threshold of the COSLOF index. Our results suggest that the COSLOF index could be used as a noninvasive quantitative marker for the preclinical stage of AD. ",
pmid_15728770,Neural processes associated with antisaccade task performance investigated with event-related FMRI.,,"One of the hallmarks of cognitive control is the suppression of prepotent but inappropriate responses. Here we used event-related functional MRI to measure functional brain activation during a stimulus-response incompatibility task. Subjects were instructed before a stimulus appeared either to look at the stimulus (prosaccade) or to look away from the stimulus (antisaccade). Eye movements were recorded so that functional brain activation could be grouped into prosaccades, correct antisaccades, and errors (saccades toward the stimulus on antisaccade trials). Correct antisaccade trials were associated with significantly more activation in frontal and parietal cortical areas compared with prosaccade trials during the late preparatory period before stimulus appearance. Correct antisaccades evoked more activation than errors in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and presupplementary eye fields during this period. No significant differences were found for any comparisons early in the preparatory period. Our data suggest that the preparation of an antisaccade activates a large frontal and parietal network that may be involved in presetting the oculomotor system for the antisaccade task. These findings indicate that a large network of frontal and posterior areas is modulated during the latter component of the preparatory period on antisaccade compared with prosaccade trials. The results further suggest that the activation level of frontal cortical areas before stimulus presentation is associated with subjects' performance in the antisaccade task. In contrast, we found no areas that were more active for correct antisaccades than prosaccades or for correct antisaccades than error antisaccades during the stimulus-response period. In fact, a number of posterior cortical areas and a few areas in the superior frontal lobe were more active during the stimulus-response period on prosaccade trials than on antisaccade trials. Error antisaccades showed a larger activation in the ACC during the stimulus-response period compared with correct antisaccades. ",

This study aims to comparatively explore the modulation effect of Baduanjin, a popular mind-body exercise, and physical exercise on the cognitive function, as well as the norepinephrine and dopamine systems using the resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) method in patients with MCI. 69 patients were randomized to the Baduanjin, brisk walking, or healthy education control group for 6 months. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were applied at baseline and at the end of the experiment. Results showed that (1) compared to the brisk walking, the Baduanjin significantly increased MoCA scores; (2) Baduanjin significantly increased the right locus coeruleus (LC) and left ventral tegmental area (VTA) rsFC with the right insula and right amygdala compared to that of the control group; and the right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) compared to that of the brisk walking group; (3) the increased right LC-right insula rsFC and right LC-right ACC rsFC were significantly associated with the corresponding MoCA score after 6-months of intervention; (4) both exercise groups experienced an increased effective connectivity from the right ACC to the left VTA compared to the control group; and (5) Baduanjin group experienced an increase in gray matter volume in the right ACC compared to the control group. Our results suggest that Baduanjin can significantly modulate intrinsic functional connectivity and the influence of the norepinephrine (LC) and dopamine (VTA) systems. These findings may shed light on the mechanisms of mind-body intervention and aid the development of new treatments for MCI. ",
pmid_27088781,Pharmacotherapy for Pain in a Family With Inherited Erythromelalgia Guided by Genomic Analysis and Functional Profiling.,,"There is a need for more effective pharmacotherapy for chronic pain, including pain in inherited erythromelalgia (IEM) in which gain-of-function mutations of sodium channel NaV1.7 make dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons hyperexcitable. To determine whether pain in IEM can be attenuated via pharmacotherapy guided by genomic analysis and functional profiling. Pain in 2 patients with IEM due to the NaV1.7 S241T mutation, predicted by structural modeling and functional analysis to be responsive to carbamazepine, was assessed in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted from September 2014 to April 21, 2015. Functional magnetic resonance imaging assessed patterns of brain activity associated with pain during treatment with placebo or carbamazepine. Multielectrode array technology was used to assess the effect of carbamazepine on firing of DRG neurons carrying S241T mutant channels. Behavioral assessment of pain; functional magnetic resonance imaging; and assessment of firing in DRG neurons carrying S241T mutant channels. This study included 2 patients from the same family with IEM and the S241T NaV1.7 mutation. We showed that, as predicted by molecular modeling, thermodynamic analysis, and functional profiling, carbamazepine attenuated pain in patients with IEM due to the S241T NaV1.7 mutation. Patient 1 reported a reduction in mean time in pain (TIP) per day during the 15-day maintenance period, from 424 minutes while taking placebo to 231.9 minutes while taking carbamazepine (400 mg/day), and a reduction in total TIP over the 15-day maintenance period, from 6360 minutes while taking placebo to 3015 minutes while taking carbamazepine. Patient 2 reported a reduction in mean TIP per day during the maintenance period, from 61 minutes while taking placebo to 9.1 minutes while taking carbamazepine (400 mg then 200 mg/day), and a reduction in total TIP, from 915 minutes while taking placebo over the 15-day maintenance period to 136 minutes while taking carbamazepine. Patient 1 reported a reduction of mean episode duration, from 615 minutes while taking placebo to 274.1 minutes while taking carbamazepine, while patient 2 reported a reduction of the mean episode duration from 91.5 minutes while taking placebo to 45.3 minutes while taking carbamazepine. Patient 1, who had a history of night awakenings from pain, reported 101 awakenings owing to pain while taking placebo during the maintenance period and 32 awakenings while taking carbamazepine. Attenuation of pain was paralleled by a shift in brain activity from valuation and pain areas to primary and secondary somatosensory, motor, and parietal attention areas. Firing of DRG neurons expressing the S241T NaV1.7 mutant channel in response to physiologically relevant thermal stimuli was reduced by carbamazepine. Our results demonstrate that pharmacotherapy guided by genomic analysis, molecular modeling, and functional profiling can attenuate neuropathic pain in patients carrying the S241T mutation. ",
pmid_19217757,A voxel-based diffusion tensor imaging study of temporal white matter in patients with schizophrenia.,,"Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a relatively new technique used to detect changes in the anisotropic diffusion of white matter. The study of the disruption of brain connectivity may increase our understanding of cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. Here we analysed DTI data in 25 patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia and 24 healthy controls. Two complementary measures, fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), were considered and analysed using voxel-based morphometry. Declarative memory functions were also investigated and their associations with DTI data were analysed. FA was significantly reduced, and the ADC increased in the left sub-gyral white matter of the temporal lobe, which involves the posterior part of the fornix. In the schizophrenic group, females had lower FA than males in the genu of the corpus callosum. Memory functions correlate with FA values. These data provide further evidence for the disruption of white matter connectivity in the left medial temporal lobe, and for its contribution to the declarative memory deficit in schizophrenia. ",
pmid_15691520,A differential pattern of neural response toward sad versus happy facial expressions in major depressive disorder.,,"Accurate recognition of facial expressions is crucial for social functioning. In depressed individuals, implicit and explicit attentional biases away from happy and toward sad stimuli have been demonstrated. These may be associated with the negative cognitions in these individuals. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), neural responses to happy and sad facial expressions were measured in 14 healthy individuals and 16 individuals with major depressive disorder. Healthy but not depressed individuals demonstrated linear increases in response in bilateral fusiform gyri and right putamen to expressions of increasing happiness, while depressed individuals demonstrated linear increases in response in left putamen, left parahippocampal gyrus/amygdala, and right fusiform gyrus to expressions of increasing sadness. There was a negative correlation in depressed individuals between depression severity and magnitude of neural response within right fusiform gyrus to happy expressions. Our findings indicate preferential increases in neural response to sad but not happy facial expressions in neural regions involved in the processing of emotional stimuli in depressed individuals. These findings may be associated with the above pattern of implicit and explicit attentional biases in these individuals and suggest a potential neural basis for the negative cognitions and social dysfunction in major depression.

pmid_23665393,An fMRI study on sunk cost effect.,,"Sunk cost effect (also called escalation of commitment, etc) is a pervasive, interesting and famous decision bias, which has been intensively discussed in psychology, economics, management, political science, zoology, etc. To date, little has been known about the neural basis of this phenomenon. We investigated it by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to monitor healthy subjects' brain activities when they made decisions in a task wherein sunk cost and incremental cost were systematically manipulated. Higher sunk cost only increased activity of some brain areas (mainly lateral frontal and parietal cortices, which are involved in risk-taking), whereas lower incremental cost mainly increased activity of some brain areas (including striatum and medial prefrontal cortex, which are sensitive to rewards). No overlapping brain areas were found to respond to both sunk cost and incremental cost. These results favor certainty effect over self-justification or diminishing sensitivity as account of sunk cost effect. ",
pmid_21310248,Dissociation of mirroring and mentalising systems in autism.,,"The role of mirror neuron systems and mentalising systems in causing poor social and communication skills in individuals with autistic spectrum conditions is hotly debated. We studied 18 adults with autistic spectrum conditions in comparison to 19 age and IQ matched typical individuals. Behavioural assessments revealed difficulties in mental state attribution and action comprehension in the autism sample. We examined brain responses when observing rational and irrational hand actions, because these actions engage mirror and mentalising components of the social brain respectively. Both typical and autistic participants activated the left anterior intraparietal sulcus component of the mirror system when viewing hand actions compared to moving shapes. The typical but not autistic participants activated the posterior mid cingulate cortex/supplementary motor area and bilateral fusiform cortex when viewing hand actions. When viewing irrational hand actions, the medial prefrontal cortex of typical participants deactivated but this region did not distinguish the different stimuli in autistic participants. These results suggest that parietal mirror regions function normally in autism, while differences in action understanding could be due to abnormal function of cingulate, fusiform and medial prefrontal regions. Thus, brain regions associated with mirroring and mentalising functions are differentially affected in autistic spectrum conditions. ",

Support vector machine","Patients with adolescent-onset schizophrenia (AOS) hold the same but severe form of symptoms with adult-onset schizophrenia, and with worse outcome and poor treatment response to antipsychotics. Several dominant brain regions of schizophrenia patients show significantly abnormal structural and functional connectivity during resting-state scans. However, coherence regional homogeneity (Cohe-ReHo) in drug-naive first-episode patients with AOS remains unclear. A total of 48 drug-naive first-episode AOS outpatients and 31 healthy controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance scans. Cohe-ReHo and support vector machine analyses were used to analyze the data. Compared with the healthy controls, the AOS group showed significantly decreased Cohe-ReHo values distributed over brain regions, including the left postcentral gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, left paracentral lobule, right precentral gyrus, right inferior parietal lobule (IPL), right middle frontal gyrus, and bilateral precuneus. No region with increased Cohe-ReHo values was observed in the AOS group compared with healthy controls. In addition, the right IPL was correlated with fluency (r=-0.324, p=0.030). However, the correlation was not significant after the Bonferroni correction at p<0.0083 (0.05/6). A combination of the Cohe-ReHo values in the bilateral precuneus and right IPL discriminated the patients from controls with the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 91.67%, 87.10%, and 89.87%, respectively. Our findings suggested that the AOS patients exhibited diminished Cohe-ReHo values in some regions within the DMN network and sensorimotor network. The abnormalities in particular brain regions (bilateral precuneus and right IPL) may serve as potential biomarkers for AOS. ",
pmid_20534850,Neural responses to unattended products predict later consumer choices.,,"Imagine you are standing at a street with heavy traffic watching someone on the other side of the road. Do you think your brain is implicitly registering your willingness to buy any of the cars passing by outside your focus of attention? To address this question, we measured brain responses to consumer products (cars) in two experimental groups using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants in the first group (high attention) were instructed to closely attend to the products and to rate their attractiveness. Participants in the second group (low attention) were distracted from products and their attention was directed elsewhere. After scanning, participants were asked to state their willingness to buy each product. During the acquisition of neural data, participants were not aware that consumer choices regarding these cars would subsequently be required. Multivariate decoding was then applied to assess the choice-related predictive information encoded in the brain during product exposure in both conditions. Distributed activation patterns in the insula and the medial prefrontal cortex were found to reliably encode subsequent choices in both the high and the low attention group. Importantly, consumer choices could be predicted equally well in the low attention as in the high attention group. This suggests that neural evaluation of products and associated choice-related processing does not necessarily depend on attentional processing of available items. Overall, the present findings emphasize the potential of implicit, automatic processes in guiding even important and complex decisions. ",

Monetary incentive delay
Reward","Patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) frequently exhibit impulsive behavior, and self-reported impulsivity is typically higher in BPD patients when compared to healthy controls. Previous functional neuroimaging studies have suggested a link between impulsivity, the ventral striatal response to reward anticipation, and prediction errors. Here we investigated the striatal neural response to monetary gain and loss anticipation and their relationship with impulsivity in 21 female BPD patients and 23 age-matched female healthy controls using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants performed a delayed monetary incentive task in which three categories of objects predicted a potential gain, loss, or neutral outcome. Impulsivity was assessed using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11). Compared to healthy controls, BPD patients exhibited significantly reduced fMRI responses of the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens (VS/NAcc) to both reward-predicting and loss-predicting cues. BIS-11 scores showed a significant positive correlation with the VS/NAcc reward anticipation responses in healthy controls, and this correlation, while also nominally positive, failed to reach significance in BPD patients. BPD patients, on the other hand, exhibited a significantly negative correlation between ventral striatal loss anticipation responses and BIS-11 scores, whereas this correlation was significantly positive in healthy controls. Our results suggest that patients with BPD show attenuated anticipation responses in the VS/NAcc and, furthermore, that higher impulsivity in BPD patients might be related to impaired prediction of aversive outcomes.

pmid_15721961,Effects of noun-verb homonymy on the neural correlates of naming concrete entities and actions.,,"The neural correlates of naming concrete entities such as tools (with nouns) and naming actions (with verbs) are partially distinct: the former are linked to the left inferotemporal (IT) region, whereas the latter are linked to the left frontal opercular (FO) and left posterior middle temporal (MT) regions. This raises an intriguing question: How would such neural patterns be influenced by noun-verb homonymy, specifically, naming tasks in which the target words denote objects or actions (e.g., ""comb"")? To explore this, we conducted a PET study in which 10 normal participants named visually presented tools or actions. The factor of homonymy yielded interesting effects: For tools, non-homonymous nouns (e.g., ""camera"") activated left IT, whereas homonymous nouns (e.g., ""comb"") activated both left IT and left FO. For actions, non-homonymous (e.g., ""juggle"") and homonymous (e.g., ""comb"") verbs activated left FO, MT, and IT, but there was evidence that the FO and MT activations were less widespread for the homonymous verbs. We also found that retrieval of the same exact words (e.g., ""comb"" and ""comb"") produced differential activation in left MT-there was greater MT activation when the words were being used to name actions, than when they were being used to name tools. Our results suggest that noun-verb homonymy has an important influence on the patterns of neural activation associated with words denoting objects and actions, and that even when the phonological forms are identical, the patterns of neural activation are different according to the demands of the task.

pmid_22287263,Disentangling self- and fairness-related neural mechanisms involved in the ultimatum game: an fMRI study.,,"Rejections of unfair offers in the ultimatum game (UG) are commonly assumed to reflect negative emotional arousal mediated by the anterior insula and medial prefrontal cortex. We aimed to disentangle those neural mechanisms associated with direct personal involvement ('I have been treated unfairly') from those associated with fairness considerations, such as the wish to discourage unfair behavior or social norm violations ('this person has been treated unfairly'). For this purpose, we used fMRI and asked participants to play the UG as responders either for themselves (myself) or on behalf of another person (third party). Unfair offers were equally often rejected in both conditions. Neuroimaging data revealed a dissociation between the medial prefrontal cortex, specifically associated with rejections in the myself condition, thus confirming its role in self-related emotional responses, and the left anterior insula, associated with rejections in both myself and third-party conditions, suggesting a role in promoting fair behavior also toward third parties. Our data extend the current understanding of the neural substrate of social decision making, by disentangling the structures sensitive to direct emotional involvement of the self from those implicated in pure fairness considerations.

fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging","Increased functional connectivity in resting state networks was found in several studies of patients with motor neuron disorders, although diffusion tensor imaging studies consistently show loss of white matter integrity. To understand the relationship between structural connectivity and functional connectivity, we examined the structural connections between regions with altered functional connectivity in patients with primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), a long-lived motor neuron disease. Connectivity matrices were constructed from resting state fMRI in 16 PLS patients to identify areas of differing connectivity between patients and healthy controls. Probabilistic fiber tracking was used to examine structural connections between regions of differing connectivity. PLS patients had 12 regions with increased functional connectivity compared to controls, with a predominance of cerebro-cerebellar connections. Increased functional connectivity was strongest between the cerebellum and cortical motor areas and between the cerebellum and frontal and temporal cortex. Fiber tracking detected no difference in connections between regions with increased functional connectivity. We conclude that functional connectivity changes are not strongly based in structural connectivity. Increased functional connectivity may be caused by common inputs, or by reduced selectivity of cortical activation, which could result from loss of intracortical inhibition when cortical afferents are intact.

pmid_17350054,Functional brain correlates of response time variability in children.,,"During tasks requiring response inhibition, intra-individual response time variability, a measure of motor response preparation, has been found to correlate with errors of commission, such that individuals with higher variability show increased commission errors. This study used fMRI to examine the neural correlates of response variability in 30 typically developing children, ages 8-12, using a simplified Go/No-go task with minimal cognitive demands. Lower variability was associated with Go activation in the anterior cerebellum (culmen) and with No-go activation in the rostral supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), the postcentral gyrus, the anterior cerebellum (culmen) and the inferior parietal lobule. For both Go and No-go events, higher variability was associated with activation in prefrontal cortex and the caudate. The findings have implications for neuropsychiatric disorders such as ADHD and suggest that during response inhibition, children with more consistent performance are able to rely on premotor circuits involving the pre-SMA, important for response selection; those with less consistent performance instead recruit prefrontal circuits involved in more complex aspects of behavioral control.

expressive suppression
proactive and reactive control","It is a unique human ability to regulate negative thoughts and feelings. Two well-investigated emotion-regulation strategies (ERSs), cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, are associated with overlapping prefrontal neural correlates, but differ temporally during the emotion-generation process. Although functional imaging studies have mainly investigated these ERS as a reaction to an emotion-inducing event, the intention to regulate upcoming negative emotions might already be associated with differences in neural activity. Hence, event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was recorded in 42 participants while they completed an emotion-regulation paradigm. During this task, participants were instructed to proactively prepare to use a specific ERS knowing that a negative, high-arousing image would appear after the preparation period. As expected, the results demonstrated prefrontal and parietal activation while participants were suppressing or reappraising their emotions (family-wise error (FWE)-corrected). The intention to suppress emotions was associated with increased activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral putamen, pre-supplementary motor area and right supramarginal gyrus (FWE-corrected). This enhanced proactive inhibitory control: (i) predicted decreased motoric activity during the actual suppression of emotional expressions and (2) trended toward a significant association with how successfully participants suppressed their emotions. However, neural correlates of preparatory control for cognitive reappraisal were not observed, possibly because contextual cues about the upcoming emotional stimulus are necessary to proactively start to cognitively reinterpret the situation.

vmPFC","Everyday consumer choices frequently involve memory, as when we retrieve information about consumer products when making purchasing decisions. In this context, poor memory may affect decision quality, particularly in individuals with memory decline, such as older adults. However, age differences in choice behavior may be reduced if older adults can recruit additional neural resources that support task performance. Although such functional compensation is well documented in other cognitive domains, it is presently unclear whether it can support memory-guided decision making and, if so, which brain regions play a role in compensation. The current study engaged younger and older humans in a memory-dependent choice task in which pairs of consumer products from a popular online-shopping site were evaluated with different delays between the first and second product. Using functional imaging (fMRI), we found that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) supports compensation as defined by three a priori criteria: (1) increased vmPFC activation was observed in older versus younger adults; (2) age-related increases in vmPFC activity were associated with increased retrieval demands; and (3) increased vmPFC activity was positively associated with performance in older adults-evidence of successful compensation. Extending these results, we observed evidence for compensation in connectivity between vmPFC and the dorsolateral PFC during memory-dependent choice. In contrast, we found no evidence for age differences in value-related processing or age-related compensation for choices without delayed retrieval. Together, these results converge on the conclusion that age-related decline in memory-dependent choice performance can be minimized via functional compensation in vmPFC. ",

VTA","Why do we self-sacrifice to help others in distress? Two competing theories have emerged, one suggesting that prosocial behavior is primarily motivated by feelings of empathic other-oriented concern, the other that we help mainly because we are egoistically focused on reducing our own discomfort. Here we explore the relationship between costly altruism and these two sub-processes of empathy, specifically drawing on the caregiving model to test the theory that trait empathic concern (e.g. general tendency to have sympathy for another) and trait personal distress (e.g. predisposition to experiencing aversive arousal states) may differentially drive altruistic behavior. We find that trait empathic concern--and not trait personal distress--motivates costly altruism, and this relationship is supported by activity in the ventral tegmental area, caudate and subgenual anterior cingulate, key regions for promoting social attachment and caregiving. Together, this data helps identify the behavioral and neural mechanisms motivating costly altruism, while demonstrating that individual differences in empathic concern-related brain responses can predict real prosocial choice.

pmid_19879367,Neural foundations of risk-return trade-off in investment decisions.,,"Many decisions people make can be described as decisions under risk. Understanding the mechanisms that drive these decisions is an important goal in decision neuroscience. Two competing classes of risky decision making models have been proposed to describe human behavior, namely utility-based models and risk-return models. Here we used a novel investment decision task that uses streams of (past) returns as stimuli to investigate how consistent the two classes of models are with the neurobiological processes underlying investment decisions (where outcomes usually follow continuous distributions). By showing (a) that risk-return models can explain choices behaviorally and (b) that the components of risk-return models (value, risk, and risk attitude) are represented in the brain during choices, we provide evidence that risk-return models describe the neural processes underlying investment decisions well. Most importantly, the observed correlation between risk and brain activity in the anterior insula during choices supports risk-return models more than utility-based models because risk is an explicit component of risk-return models but not of the utility-based models.

pmid_16221928,Brain networks involved in viewing angry hands or faces.,,"Most neuropsychological research on the perception of emotion concerns the perception of faces. Yet in everyday life, hand actions are also modulated by our affective state, revealing it, in turn, to the observer. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify brain regions engaged during the observation of hand actions performed either in a neutral or an angry way. We also asked whether these are the same regions as those involved in perceiving expressive faces. During the passive observation of emotionally neutral hand movements, the fMRI signal increased significantly in dorsal and ventral premotor cortices, with the exact location of the 'peaks' distinct from those induced by face observation. Various areas in the extrastriate visual cortex were also engaged, overlapping with the face-related activity. When the observed hand action was performed with emotion, additional regions were recruited including the right dorsal premotor, the right medial prefrontal cortex, the left anterior insula and a region in the rostral part of the supramarginal gyrus bilaterally. These regions, except for the supramarginal gyrus, were also activated during the perception of angry faces. These results complement the wealth of studies on the perception of affect from faces and provide further insights into the processes involved in the perception of others underlying, perhaps, social constructs such as empathy.

pmid_18374603,Right temporopolar activation associated with unique perception.,,"Unique mode of perception, or the ability to see things differently from others, is one of the psychological resources required for creative mental activities. Behavioral studies using ambiguous visual stimuli have successfully induced diverse responses from subjects, and the unique responses defined in this paradigm were observed in higher frequency in the artistic population as compared to the nonartistic population. However, the neural substrates that underlie such unique perception have yet to be investigated. In the present study, ten ambiguous figures were used as stimuli. The subjects were instructed to say what the figures looked like during functional MRI scanning. The responses were classified as ""frequent"", ""infrequent"" or ""unique"" responses based on the appearance frequency of the same response in an independent age- and gender-matched control group. An event-related analysis contrasting unique vs. frequent responses revealed the greatest activation in the right temporal pole, which survived a whole brain multiple comparison. An alternative parametric modulation analysis was also performed to show that potentially confounding perceptual effects deriving from differences in visual stimuli make no significant contribution to this temporopolar activation. Previous neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies have shown the involvement of the temporal pole in perception-emotion linkage. Thus, our results suggest that unique perception is produced by the integration of perceptual and emotional processes, and this integration might underlie essential parts of creative mental activities. ",
pmid_19803691,Contributions of spatial working memory to visuomotor learning.,,"Previous studies of motor learning have described the importance of cognitive processes during the early stages of learning; however, the precise nature of these processes and their neural correlates remains unclear. The present study investigated whether spatial working memory (SWM) contributes to visuomotor adaptation depending on the stage of learning. We tested the hypothesis that SWM would contribute early in the adaptation process by measuring (i) the correlation between SWM tasks and the rate of adaptation, and (ii) the overlap between the neural substrates of a SWM mental rotation task and visuomotor adaptation. Participants completed a battery of neuropsychological tests, a visuomotor adaptation task, and an SWM task involving mental rotation, with the latter two tasks performed in a 3.0-T MRI scanner. Performance on a neuropsychological test of SWM (two-dimensional mental rotation) correlated with the rate of early, but not late, visuomotor adaptation. During the early, but not late, adaptation period, participants showed overlapping brain activation with the SWM mental rotation task, in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the bilateral inferior parietal lobules. These findings suggest that the early, but not late, phase of visuomotor adaptation engages SWM processes. ",
pmid_24353185,Altered spontaneous brain activity in type 2 diabetes: a resting-state functional MRI study.,,"Previous research has shown that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment. Patients with impaired cognition often show decreased spontaneous brain activity on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). This study used rs-fMRI to investigate changes in spontaneous brain activity among patients with T2DM and to determine the relationship of these changes with cognitive impairment. T2DM patients (n = 29) and age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy control subjects (n = 27) were included in this study. Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) values were calculated to represent spontaneous brain activity. Brain volume and cognition were also evaluated among these participants. Compared with healthy control subjects, patients with T2DM had significantly decreased ALFF and ReHo values in the occipital lobe and postcentral gyrus. Patients performed worse on several cognitive tests; this impaired cognitive performance was correlated with decreased activity in the cuneus and lingual gyrus in the occipital lobe. Brain volume did not differ between the two groups. The abnormalities of spontaneous brain activity reflected by ALFF and ReHo measurements in the absence of structural changes in T2DM patients may provide insights into the neurological pathophysiology underlying diabetes-associated cognitive decline.

pmid_15737657,Functional neuroanatomy of working memory in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.,,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults is an increasingly recognized psychiatric disorder, linked with impairments in numerous life domains and with neurocognitive dysfunctions. However, the neural substrate of cognitive functioning in adults with this disorder has been relatively unexamined. The objective of this study was to examine neural functioning in ADHD adults during performance on a verbal working memory task. A sample of unmedicated adults with ADHD (n = 20) and control subjects (n = 20) performed a 2-back task of working memory, and the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) response was used as a measure of neural activity during working memory performance. Though working memory performance did not differ significantly between ADHD adults and control subjects, ADHD adults showed significantly decreased activity in cerebellar and occipital regions and a trend toward decreased activation in an a priori predicted region of the prefrontal cortex. ADHD adults showed altered patterns of neural activity despite comparable performance on a verbal working memory task. These findings suggest that the cerebellum is involved in the pathophysiology of at least some cognitive deficits associated with ADHD and emphasize the need for additional research aimed at elucidating the role of the cerebellum in ADHD symptomatology.

fMRI","Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue that has been demonstrated to successfully treat diabetes and promote weight loss. The mechanisms by which liraglutide confers weight loss remain to be fully clarified. Thus, we investigated whether GLP-1 receptors are expressed in human brains and whether liraglutide administration affects neural responses to food cues in diabetic individuals (primary outcome). In 22 consecutively studied human brains, expression of GLP-1 receptors in the hypothalamus, medulla oblongata and parietal cortex was examined using immunohistochemistry. In a randomised (assigned by the pharmacy using a randomisation enrolment table), placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial, 21 individuals with type 2 diabetes (18 included in analysis due to lack or poor quality of data) were treated with placebo and liraglutide for a total of 17 days each (0.6 mg for 7 days, 1.2 mg for 7 days, and 1.8 mg for 3 days). Participants were eligible if they had type 2 diabetes and were currently being treated with lifestyle changes or metformin. Participants, caregivers, people doing measurements and/or examinations, and people assessing the outcomes were blinded to the medication assignment. We studied metabolic changes as well as neurocognitive and neuroimaging (functional MRI) of responses to food cues at the clinical research centre of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the presence of GLP-1 receptors on neurons in the human hypothalamus, medulla and parietal cortex. Liraglutide decreased activation of the parietal cortex in response to highly desirable (vs less desirable) food images (p < 0.001; effect size: placebo 0.53 ± 0.24, liraglutide -0.47 ± 0.18). No significant adverse effects were noted. In a secondary analysis, we observed decreased activation in the insula and putamen, areas involved in the reward system. Furthermore, we showed that increased ratings of hunger and appetite correlated with increased brain activation in response to highly desirable food cues while on liraglutide, while ratings of nausea correlated with decreased brain activation. For the first time, we demonstrate the presence of GLP-1 receptors in human brains. We also observe that liraglutide alters brain activity related to highly desirable food cues. Our data point to a central mechanism contributing to, or underlying, the effects of liraglutide on metabolism and weight loss. Future studies will be needed to confirm and extend these findings in larger samples of diabetic individuals and/or with the higher doses of liraglutide (3 mg) recently approved for obesity.

pmid_20421135,The effects of Brief Behavioral Activation Therapy for Depression on cognitive control in affective contexts: An fMRI investigation.,,"Unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by impaired cognitive control in affective contexts, but the potential for psychotherapy to affect the neural correlates of these functions has not been evaluated. Twelve adults with and 15 adults without MDD participated in two identical functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans that utilized a task requiring cognitive control in both sad and neutral contexts. Between scans, MDD outpatients received Behavioral Activation Therapy for Depression, a psychotherapy modality designed to increase engagement with positive stimuli and reduce avoidance behaviors. Seventy-five percent of adults with MDD were treatment responders, achieving post-treatment Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score of six or below. Consistent with predictions, psychotherapy resulted in decreased activation in response to cognitive control stimuli presented within a sad context in prefrontal structures, including the paracingulate gyrus, the right orbital frontal cortex, and the right frontal pole. Furthermore, the magnitude of pretreatment activation in the paracingulate gyrus cluster responsive to psychotherapy predicted the magnitude of depressive symptom change after psychotherapy. Replication with larger samples is needed, as are follow-up studies that involve placebo control groups, wait-list control groups, and alternative forms of antidepressant intervention. Behavioral Activation Therapy for Depression improves depressive symptoms and concomitantly influences brain systems mediating cognitive control in affective contexts. ",
pmid_15050583,Neural correlates of context memory with real-world events.,,"There has been little evidence for the difference in the retrieval processes of when and where something happened, one of the important factors in understanding episodic memory. We used positron emission tomography (PET) to identify the neural networks associated with temporal and spatial context memory of events experienced under experimental conditions similar to those of everyday life. Before PET, subjects experienced 36 events. The events were divided into four groups of nine each. The subjects experienced the first two groups of events before a 15-min recess and the other two after the recess; they experienced the first and last groups of events in one room, took a recess in another room, and experienced the second and third groups in a different room. During PET, the subjects were scanned under three different retrieval tasks: a time-retrieval task, a place-retrieval task, and a simple recognition task. The results showed that the retrieval of time and space, compared with the simple recognition, was associated with activity in substantially different regions as well as a common region: time retrieval with the posterior part of the right orbitofrontal cortex and left inferior parietal lobule, place retrieval with two regions in right parietal association cortex, right posterior cingulate gyrus, left precentral gyrus, and right cerebellum, and both with the right inferior frontal gyrus. These findings indicate that there are unique areas, in addition to a common area, for retrieving temporal and spatial context. ",

worry","Recent emotion dysregulation models of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) propose chronic worry in GAD functions as a maladaptive attempt to regulate anxiety related to uncertain or unpredictable outcomes. Emotion acceptance is an adaptive emotion regulation strategy increasingly incorporated into newer cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches to GAD to counter chronic worry. The current study explores the mechanisms of emotion acceptance as an alternate emotion regulation strategy to worry or emotion suppression using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Twenty-one female participants diagnosed with GAD followed counterbalanced instructions to regulate responses to personally relevant worry statements by engaging in either emotion acceptance, worry or emotion suppression. Emotion acceptance resulted in lower ratings of distress than worry and was associated with increased dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activation and increased ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC)-amygdala functional connectivity. In contrast, worry showed significantly greater distress ratings than acceptance or suppression and was associated with increased precuneus, VLPFC, amygdala and hippocampal activation. Suppression did not significantly differ from acceptance in distress ratings or amygdala recruitment, but resulted in significantly greater insula and VLPFC activation and decreased VLPFC-amygdala functional connectivity. Emotion acceptance closely aligned with activation and connectivity patterns reported in studies of contextual extinction learning and mindful awareness. ",

Threat","Adolescents with conduct problems and low callous-unemotional traits are characterised by high levels of reactive aggression. Prior studies suggest that they can have exaggerated neural and behavioural responses to negative emotional stimuli, accompanied by compromised affect regulation and atypical engagement of prefrontal areas during cognitive control. This pattern may in part explain their symptoms. Clarifying how neurocognitive responses to negative emotional stimuli can be modulated in this group has potential translational relevance. We present fMRI data from a cognitive conflict task in which the requirement to visually scan emotional (vs. calm) faces was held constant across low and high levels of cognitive conflict. Participants were 17 adolescent males with conduct problems and low levels of callous-unemotional traits (CP/LCU); 17 adolescents with conduct problems and high levels of callous-unemotional traits (CP/HCU, who typically show blunted reactivity to fear), and 18 typically developing controls (age range 10-16). Control participants showed typical attenuation of amygdala response to fear relative to calm faces under high (relative to low) conflict, replicating previous findings in a healthy adult sample. In contrast, children with CP/LCU showed a reduced (left amygdala) or reversed (right amygdala) attenuation effect under high cognitive conflict conditions. Children with CP/HCU did not differ from controls. Findings suggest atypical modulation of amygdala response as a function of task demands, and raise the possibility that those with CP/LCU are unable to implement typical regulation of amygdala response when cognitive task demands are high.

pmid_19320550,"Span, CRUNCH, and beyond: working memory capacity and the aging brain.",,"Neuroimaging data emphasize that older adults often show greater extent of brain activation than younger adults for similar objective levels of difficulty. A possible interpretation of this finding is that older adults need to recruit neuronal resources at lower loads than younger adults, leaving no resources for higher loads, and thus leading to performance decrements [Compensation-Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis; e.g., Reuter-Lorenz, P. A., & Cappell, K. A. Neurocognitive aging and the compensation hypothesis. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 17, 177-182, 2008]. The Compensation-Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis leads to the prediction that activation differences between younger and older adults should disappear when task difficulty is made subjectively comparable. In a Sternberg memory search task, this can be achieved by assessing brain activity as a function of load relative to the individual's memory span, which declines with age. Specifically, we hypothesized a nonlinear relationship between load and both performance and brain activity and predicted that asymptotes in the brain activation function should correlate with performance asymptotes (corresponding to working memory span). The results suggest that age differences in brain activation can be largely attributed to individual variations in working memory span. Interestingly, the brain activation data show a sigmoid relationship with load. Results are discussed in terms of Cowan's [Cowan, N. The magical number 4 in short-term memory: A reconsideration of mental storage capacity. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 24, 87-114, 2001] model of working memory and theories of impaired inhibitory processes in aging. ",

In total, 21 patients were randomly divided into two groups. Group A (11 patients) received both acupuncture and conventional treatment, while group B (10 patients) received conventional treatment only. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed on each participant before and after treatment. Regional homogeneity analysis was performed to investigate the potential mechanism of acupuncture treatment by comparing differences in cerebral activity between treatments. Group A showed higher ReHo in the frontal lobe (BA6, BA46), supra-marginal gyrus (BA40), middle temporal gyrus (BA21), cerebellum, and insula. Group B showed higher ReHo in the frontal lobe (BA6) and parietal lobe (BA3, BA7). Acupuncture and conventional treatment triggered relatively different clinical efficacy and brain responses. Acupuncture treatment more significantly improved the symptoms of stroke patients. More marked changes in sensory, emotional, and motor areas (including the frontal lobe, middle temporal gyrus, cerebellum, and insula) might reflect the specific acupuncture mechanism. ",

Social risk","Social considerations significantly influence daily purchase decisions, and the perception of social risk (i.e., the anticipated disapproval of others) is crucial in dissuading consumers from making purchases. However, the neural basis for consumers' perception of social risk remains undiscovered, and this novel study clarifies the relevant neural processes. A total of 26 volunteers were scanned while they evaluated purchase intention of products (purchase intention task) and their anticipation of others' disapproval for possessing a product (social risk task), using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The fMRI data from the purchase intention task was used to identify the brain region associated with perception of social risk during purchase decision making by using subjective social risk ratings for a parametric modulation analysis. Furthermore, we aimed to explore if there was a difference between participants' purchase decisions and their explicit evaluations of social risk, with reference to the neural activity associated with social risk perception. For this, subjective social risk ratings were used for a parametric modulation analysis on fMRI data from the social risk task. Analysis of the purchase intention task revealed a significant positive correlation between ratings of social risk and activity in the anterior insula, an area of the brain that is known as part of the emotion-related network. Analysis of the social risk task revealed a significant positive correlation between ratings of social risk and activity in the temporal parietal junction and the medial prefrontal cortex, which are known as theory-of-mind regions. Our results suggest that the anterior insula processes consumers' social risk implicitly to prompt consumers not to buy socially unacceptable products, whereas ToM-related regions process such risk explicitly in considering the anticipated disapproval of others. These findings may prove helpful in understanding the mental processes involved in purchase decisions. ",

Here the degree of sensory preservation within the olfactory system, a system that lacks an obligatory thalamic relay, and its relationship to the consciousness level in DOC patients of various etiologies was assessed. Clinical Coma Recovery Scale - Revised (CRS-R) as well as cerebral responses to odors by means of functional magnetic resonance were obtained in a group of vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (n = 26) patients, minimally conscious state (n = 7) patients and healthy controls (n = 25). A majority of vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome patients (58%) and 100% of minimally conscious state patients demonstrated a significant preservation of olfactory neural processing, manifested by activation within the piriform cortex, an area considered as a primary olfactory region. Degree of preservation of olfactory processing differed linearly in line with the patients' etiologies where groups demonstrating greater conscious awareness demonstrated more significant processing. Viewed over all DOC patients, there was a significant negative association between odor-related activity in the orbitofrontal cortex and CRS-R scores. It is demonstrated that DOC patients exhibit a significant preservation of olfactory neural processing with a clear relationship to etiopathologies and clinical measures even years after of chronification of DOC.

If they are, it would corroborate the idea that changes in hypothalamic function result in alteration in brainstem pain processing sensitivity, which either triggers a migraine headache itself or allows an external trigger to initiate a migraine headache. We hypothesise that hypothalamic activity increases immediately prior to a migraine headache and this is accompanied by altered functional connectivity to pain processing sites in the brainstem. In 34 migraineurs and 26 healthy controls, we collected a series comprising 108 pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling images and 180 gradient-echo echo planar resting-state functional magnetic resonance volumes to measure resting regional cerebral blood flow and functional connectivity respectively. Images were pre-processed and analysed using custom SPM12 and Matlab software. Our results reflect that immediately prior to a migraine headache, resting regional cerebral blood flow decreases in the lateral hypothalamus. In addition, resting functional connectivity strength decreased between the lateral hypothalamus and important regions of the pain processing pathway, such as the midbrain periaqueductal gray, dorsal pons, rostral ventromedial medulla and cingulate cortex, only during this critical period before a migraine headache. These data suggest altered hypothalamic function and connectivity in the period immediately prior to a migraine headache and supports the hypothesis that the hypothalamus is involved in migraine initiation.

In the fMRI scanner, individuals heard their neutral and their favorite music for 3 min each. Favorite versus neutral music-listening contrasts showed greater activation in controls than depressed patients in medial orbital frontal cortex and nucleus accumbens/ventral striatum. Left medial prefrontal cortex activity was positively correlated with pleasure scores, whereas middle temporal cortex and globus pallidus were negatively correlated with pleasure. This paradigm activated neurocircuitry of reward processing and showed clinically meaningful alterations in depression. ",

Intramural National Institute of Mental Health; approved by the institutional review board. Patients Pediatric subjects with BPD (n = 20) with at least 1 manic or hypomanic episode meeting strict DSM-IV criteria for duration and elevated, expansive mood. Controls (n = 20) and their first-degree relatives lacked psychiatric disorders. Groups were matched for age and sex and did not differ in IQ. With a 1.5-T MRI machine, we collected 1.2-mm axial sections (124 per subject) with an axial 3-dimensional spoiled gradient recalled echo in the steady state sequence. Image analysis was by optimized voxel-based morphometry. Subjects with BPD had reduced gray matter volume in the left DLPFC. With a less conservative statistical threshold, additional gray matter reductions were found in the left accumbens and left amygdala. No difference was found in the hippocampus or orbitofrontal cortex. Our results are consistent with data implicating the prefrontal cortex in emotion regulation, a process that is perturbed in BPD. Reductions in amygdala and accumbens volumes are consistent with neuropsychological data on pediatric BPD. Further study is required to determine the relationship between these findings in children and adults with BPD. ",

In this study, we investigated the effects of long-term Tai Chi training on motor symptoms in PD and the underlying mechanisms. Ninety-five early-stage PD patients were enrolled and randomly divided into Tai Chi (n = 32), brisk walking (n = 31) and no-exercise (n = 32) groups. At baseline, 6 months and 12 months during one-year intervention, all participants underwent motor symptom evaluation by Berg balance scale (BBS), Unified PD rating-scale (UPDRS), Timed Up and Go test (TUG) and 3D gait analysis, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), plasma cytokine and metabolomics analysis, and blood Huntingtin interaction protein 2 (HIP2) mRNA level analysis. Longitudinal self-changes were calculated using repeated measures ANOVA. GEE (generalized estimating equations) was used to assess factors associated with the longitudinal data of rating scales. Switch rates were used for fMRI analysis. False discovery rate correction was used for multiple correction. Participants in the Tai Chi group had better performance in BBS, UPDRS, TUG and step width. Besides, Tai Chi was advantageous over brisk walking in improving BBS and step width. The improved BBS was correlated with enhanced visual network function and downregulation of interleukin-1β. The improvements in UPDRS were associated with enhanced default mode network function, decreased L-malic acid and 3-phosphoglyceric acid, and increased adenosine and HIP2 mRNA levels. In addition, arginine biosynthesis, urea cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle and beta oxidation of very-long-chain fatty acids were also improved by Tai Chi training. Long-term Tai Chi training improves motor function, especially gait and balance, in PD. The underlying mechanisms may include enhanced brain network function, reduced inflammation, improved amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism and neurotransmitter metabolism, and decreased vulnerability to dopaminergic degeneration.

Fifty-two non-constipated irritable bowel syndrome patients (28 female) were enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial with alosetron (1-4 mg b.d.). Thirty-seven patients completed both brain scans following randomization. Rectosigmoid stimulation was performed with a computer-controlled barostat. Changes in regional cerebral blood flow were assessed using H215O positron emission tomography. Stimulus ratings and changes in gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed using verbal descriptor scales. Alosetron, but not placebo, treatment was associated with a decrease in symptom ratings, and reductions in emotional stimulus ratings. Compared to baseline, alosetron treatment was associated with reduced regional cerebral blood flow in bilateral frontotemporal and various limbic structures, including the amygdala. Compared to placebo, decreases in activity of the amygdala, ventral striatum, hypothalamus and infragenual cingulate gyrus were significantly greater after alosetron. In non-constipated irritable bowel syndrome patients, 3 weeks of treatment with a 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonist decreases brain activity in response to unanticipated, anticipated and delivered aversive rectal stimuli in structures of the emotional motor system, and this is associated with a decrease in gastrointestinal symptoms.

The specific nature of the functional irregularities within these structures remains poorly understood. The authors used a passive avoidance task to examine the responsiveness of these systems to early stimulus-reinforcement exposure, when prediction errors are greatest and learning maximized, and to reward in youths with psychopathic traits and comparison youths. While performing the passive avoidance learning task, 15 youths with conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder plus a high level of psychopathic traits and 15 healthy subjects completed a 3.0-T fMRI scan. Relative to the comparison youths, the youths with a disruptive behavior disorder plus psychopathic traits showed less orbitofrontal responsiveness both to early stimulus-reinforcement exposure and to rewards, as well as less caudate response to early stimulus-reinforcement exposure. There were no group differences in amygdala responsiveness to these two task measures, but amygdala responsiveness throughout the task was lower in the youths with psychopathic traits. Compromised sensitivity to early reinforcement information in the orbitofrontal cortex and caudate and to reward outcome information in the orbitofrontal cortex of youths with conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder plus psychopathic traits suggests that the integrated functioning of the amygdala, caudate, and orbitofrontal cortex may be disrupted. This provides a functional neural basis for why such youths are more likely to repeat disadvantageous decisions. New treatment possibilities are raised, as pharmacologic modulations of serotonin and dopamine can affect this form of learning. ",

An increased dopaminergic neurotransmission in the ventral basal ganglia that has been found during placebo analgesia suggests a role for the dopaminergic system (Scott et al., 2007). It is, however, unclear whether striatal dopaminergic activity is causally involved in this type of analgesia. This study aimed at exploring the functional role of the dopaminergic system in placebo analgesia. To this end, we investigated the effect of the dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonist haloperidol on behavioral and neural measures of placebo analgesia using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy volunteers. We found that 2 mg haloperidol p.o. significantly reduced the correlation between dorsal striatum activity and the individual placebo response, but had no significant effect on placebo analgesia at the behavioral or neural level, as indexed by activity in sensory or pain-modulatory brain regions. Our study therefore suggests that dopaminergic neurotransmission might not be causally involved in placebo analgesia but is related to phenomena associated with placebo analgesia such as reward processing and learning.

pmid_21884323,Neural correlates of coherent and biological motion perception in autism.,,"Recent evidence suggests those with autism may be generally impaired in visual motion perception. To examine this, we investigated both coherent and biological motion processing in adolescents with autism employing both psychophysical and fMRI methods. Those with autism performed as well as matched controls during coherent motion perception but had significantly higher thresholds for biological motion perception. The autism group showed reduced posterior Superior Temporal Sulcus (pSTS), parietal and frontal activity during a biological motion task while showing similar levels of activity in MT+/V5 during both coherent and biological motion trials. Activity in MT+/V5 was predictive of individual coherent motion thresholds in both groups. Activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and pSTS was predictive of biological motion thresholds in control participants but not in those with autism. Notably, however, activity in DLPFC was negatively related to autism symptom severity. These results suggest that impairments in higher-order social or attentional networks may underlie visual motion deficits observed in autism. ",
pmid_20685975,Functional magnetic resonance imaging reveals the neural substrates of arm transport and grip formation in reach-to-grasp actions in humans.,,"Picking up a cup requires transporting the arm to the cup (transport component) and preshaping the hand appropriately to grasp the handle (grip component). Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the human neural substrates of the transport component and its relationship with the grip component. Participants were shown three-dimensional objects placed either at a near location, adjacent to the hand, or at a far location, within reach but not adjacent to the hand. Participants performed three tasks at each location as follows: (1) touching the object with the knuckles of the right hand; (2) grasping the object with the right hand; or (3) passively viewing the object. The transport component was manipulated by positioning the object in the far versus the near location. The grip component was manipulated by asking participants to grasp the object versus touching it. For the first time, we have identified the neural substrates of the transport component, which include the superior parieto-occipital cortex and the rostral superior parietal lobule. Consistent with past studies, we found specialization for the grip component in bilateral anterior intraparietal sulcus and left ventral premotor cortex; now, however, we also find activity for the grasp even when no transport is involved. In addition to finding areas specialized for the transport and grip components in parietal cortex, we found an integration of the two components in dorsal premotor cortex and supplementary motor areas, two regions that may be important for the coordination of reach and grasp.

Abnormalities in glucose regulation are involved in several complications related to type 2 diabetes, but their role in these cerebral complications is unclear. We systematically reviewed studies of the association between glucose regulation (glycaemia, hypoglycaemic events, insulin concentration, insulin resistance, and glucose-lowering treatment) and cognitive function and brain abnormalities on MRI in people with type 2 diabetes. The 86 papers included showed that glycaemia, particularly high HbA1c concentration and glucose variability, are negatively associated with cognitive function in people with type 2 diabetes without dementia. However, the strength of this association is weak, and HbA1c generally accounted for less than 10% of the variance in cognition. Importantly, few studies have measured long-term cerebral outcomes, such as dementia and structural brain changes on MRI, and the effect of glucose-lowering treatment on these outcomes. More randomised controlled trials are needed to establish the effect of glucose-lowering treatment on long-term cognitive function in people with type 2 diabetes. ",
pmid_19171077,Differential frontal-striatal and paralimbic activity during reversal learning in major depressive disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder.,,"Several lines of research suggest a disturbance of reversal learning (reward and punishment processing, and affective switching) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is also characterized by abnormal reversal learning, and is often co-morbid with MDD. However, neurobiological distinctions between the disorders are unclear. Functional neuroimaging (activation) studies comparing MDD and OCD directly are lacking. Twenty non-medicated OCD-free patients with MDD, 20 non-medicated MDD-free patients with OCD, and 27 healthy controls performed a self-paced reversal learning task in an event-related design during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Compared with healthy controls, both MDD and OCD patients displayed prolonged mean reaction times (RTs) but normal accuracy. In MDD subjects, mean RTs were correlated with disease severity. Imaging results showed MDD-specific hyperactivity in the anterior insula during punishment processing and in the putamen during reward processing. Moreover, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the anterior PFC during affective switching showed a linear decrease across controls, MDD and OCD. Finally, the OCD group showed blunted responsiveness of the orbitofrontal (OFC)-striatal loop during reward, and in the OFC and anterior insula during affective switching. This study shows frontal-striatal and (para)limbic functional abnormalities during reversal learning in MDD, in the context of generic psychomotor slowing. These data converge with currently influential models on the neuropathophysiology of MDD. Moreover, this study reports differential neural patterns in frontal-striatal and paralimbic structures on this task between MDD and OCD, confirming previous findings regarding the neural correlates of deficient reversal learning in OCD.

pmid_21679770,Impact of mindfulness on the neural responses to emotional pictures in experienced and beginner meditators.,,"There is mounting evidence that mindfulness meditation is beneficial for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders, yet little is known regarding the neural mechanisms through which mindfulness modulates emotional responses. Thus, a central objective of this functional magnetic resonance imaging study was to investigate the effects of mindfulness on the neural responses to emotionally laden stimuli. Another major goal of this study was to examine the impact of the extent of mindfulness training on the brain mechanisms supporting the processing of emotional stimuli. Twelve experienced (with over 1000 h of practice) and 10 beginner meditators were scanned as they viewed negative, positive, and neutral pictures in a mindful state and a non-mindful state of awareness. Results indicated that the Mindful condition attenuated emotional intensity perceived from pictures, while brain imaging data suggested that this effect was achieved through distinct neural mechanisms for each group of participants. For experienced meditators compared with beginners, mindfulness induced a deactivation of default mode network areas (medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices) across all valence categories and did not influence responses in brain regions involved in emotional reactivity during emotional processing. On the other hand, for beginners relative to experienced meditators, mindfulness induced a down-regulation of the left amygdala during emotional processing. These findings suggest that the long-term practice of mindfulness leads to emotional stability by promoting acceptance of emotional states and enhanced present-moment awareness, rather than by eliciting control over low-level affective cerebral systems from higher-order cortical brain regions. These results have implications for affect-related psychological disorders. ",

This study is the first to examine how neural response to food commercials differs from other stimuli (e.g. non-food commercials and television show) and to explore how this response may differ by weight status. The blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging activation was measured in 30 adolescents ranging from lean to obese in response to food and non-food commercials imbedded in a television show. Adolescents exhibited greater activation in regions implicated in visual processing (e.g. occipital gyrus), attention (e.g. parietal lobes), cognition (e.g. temporal gyrus and posterior cerebellar lobe), movement (e.g. anterior cerebellar cortex), somatosensory response (e.g. postcentral gyrus) and reward [e.g. orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)] during food commercials. Obese participants exhibited less activation during food relative to non-food commercials in neural regions implicated in visual processing (e.g. cuneus), attention (e.g. posterior cerebellar lobe), reward (e.g. ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ACC) and salience detection (e.g. precuneus). Obese participants did exhibit greater activation in a region implicated in semantic control (e.g. medial temporal gyrus). These findings may inform current policy debates regarding the impact of food advertising to minors. ",

A randomized, controlled, three-group, double-blind pilot study. Persons with physician-diagnosed fibromyalgia. Active CES device, sham device, and usual care alone. Those individuals using the active device had a greater decrease in average pain (P = .023) than individuals using the sham device or receiving usual care alone over time. Preliminary analyses of the functional magnetic resonance imaging data on a subset of six participants from each of the two device groups show that individuals using an active CES device had a decrease in activation in the pain processing regions of the brain compared to those using a sham device. The observed decrease in activation in the pain processing regions may indicate a decrease in neural activity in these regions that may be related to decreased pain. This is the first randomized, controlled trial of CES in patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia to report functional magnetic resonance imaging data. ",
pmid_21782030,"Apathy, depression, and motor symptoms have distinct and separable resting activity patterns in idiopathic Parkinson disease.",,"Apathy and depression are heterogeneous syndromes with symptoms that overlap clinically. This clinical overlap leads to problems with classification and diagnosis in clinical populations. No functional imaging study has attempted to separate brain regions altered in apathy from those altered in depression in a clinical population. Parkinson disease (PD) is a disorder in which apathy and depression co-exist in a single population. We evaluate the relationship between apathy, depression, and motor severity of disease in PD, focusing on the relationship between these factors and the amplitude of the low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in the resting state. We first evaluated if the resting ALFF signal is a reliable measure for our clinical question. For this, we develop and introduce a cross validation approach we term the ""Regional Mapping of Reliable Differences"" (RMRD) method to evaluate reliability of regions of interest deemed ""significant"" by standard voxel-wise techniques. Using this approach, we show that the apathy score in this sample is best predicted by ALFF signal in the left supplementary motor cortex, the right orbitofrontal cortex, and the right middle frontal cortex, whereas depression score is best predicted by ALFF signal in the right subgenual cingulate. Disease severity was best predicted by ALFF signal in the right putamen. A number of additional regions are also statistically (but not reliably) correlated with our neuropsychological measures and disease severity. Our results support the use of resting fMRI as a means to evaluate neuropsychiatric states and motor disease progression in Parkinson disease, and the clinical and epidemiologic observation that apathy and depression are distinct pathological entities. Our finding that ""significance"" and ""reliability"" are dissociated properties of regions of interest identified as significant using standard voxel-wise techniques suggests that including reliability analyses may add useful scientific information in neurobehavioral research.

A common V(108/158)M substitution in the gene for catecholamine-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an important enzyme regulating prefrontal dopamine turnover, predicted reduced dopamine synthesis in midbrain and qualitatively affected the interaction with prefrontal cortex. These data implicate a dopaminergic tuning mechanism in prefrontal cortex and suggest a systems-level mechanism for cognitive and neuropsychiatric associations with COMT. ",

TBSS","Dividing schizophrenia into its deficit (SZD) and nondeficit (SZND) subtypes may help to identify specific and more homogeneous pathophysiological characteristics. Our aim was to define a whole brain voxelwise map specifically characterizing white matter tracts of schizophrenia patients with and without the deficit syndrome. We compared microstructural diffusion-related parameters as measured by diffusion tensor imaging in 21 SZD patients, 21 SZND patients, and 21 healthy controls, age- and gender-matched. Results showed that fractional anisotropy was reduced in the right precentral area in SZND patients, and in the left corona radiata of the schizophrenia group as a whole. Axial diffusivity was reduced in the left postcentral area of SZD patients and in the left cerebellum of the whole schizophrenia group. Radial diffusivity was increased in the left forceps minor of SZD patients, in the left internal capsule of SZND patients, and in the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus in the whole schizophrenia group. Mean diffusivity was increased from healthy controls to SZD patients to SZND patients in the right occipital lobe. In conclusion, SZD patients are not simply at the extreme end of a severity continuum of white matter disruption. Rather, the SZD and SZND subtypes are associated with distinct and specific brain microstructural anomalies that are consistent with their peculiar psychopathological dimensions. ",

Withdrawal of the offending drug(s) is considered the first step in management. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may be a useful technique for obtaining information on particular neuronal changes in the pain network involved in this condition. To identify specific fMRI patterns in patients suffering from CMwMO before and after withdrawal intervention. We collected fMRI data from a group of patients suffering from CMwMO, evaluating those patients prior to and 6 months following withdrawal. We applied stimuli at sites far removed from where the headaches were experienced. Moreover, pre-intervention fMRI data from the headache patients were compared with those obtained from headache-free and otherwise healthy controls. Before withdrawal, the right supramarginal gyrus, the right inferior and superior parietal cortex were hypoactive. Activity recovered to almost normal 6 months after withdrawal of the offending medications. The hypoactivation we detected in the lateral pain system indicate that there exists a modification of the pain network in CMwMO and that these changes are reversible with therapy. ",

Inductive reasoning
Letter series
Number series","Neural correlate of human inductive reasoning process is still unclear. Number series and letter series completion are two typical inductive reasoning tasks, and with a common core component of rule induction. Previous studies have demonstrated that different strategies are adopted in number series and letter series completion tasks; even the underlying rules are identical. In the present study, we examined cortical activation as a function of two different reasoning strategies for solving series completion tasks. The retrieval strategy, used in number series completion tasks, involves direct retrieving of arithmetic knowledge to get the relations between items. The procedural strategy, used in letter series completion tasks, requires counting a certain number of times to detect the relations linking two items. The two strategies require essentially the equivalent cognitive processes, but have different working memory demands (the procedural strategy incurs greater demands). The procedural strategy produced significant greater activity in areas involved in memory retrieval (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC) and mental representation/maintenance (posterior parietal cortex, PPC). An ACT-R model of the tasks successfully predicted behavioral performance and BOLD responses. The present findings support a general-purpose dual-process theory of inductive reasoning regarding the cognitive architecture. ",
pmid_16135618,Altered neural substrates of cognitive control in childhood ADHD: evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging.,,"The study compared the neural bases of two cognitive control operations, interference suppression and response inhibition, between children with and children without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Ten children (7-11 years of age) with combined-type ADHD and 10 comparison subjects matched for age and gender underwent rapid event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during performance of a modified flanker task. Functional maps were generated through group averaging and performance-based correlational analyses. Interference suppression in ADHD subjects was characterized by reduced engagement of a frontal-striatal-temporal-parietal network that subserved healthy performance. In contrast, response inhibition performance relied upon different regions in the two groups, frontal-striatal in comparison subjects but right superior temporal in ADHD children. Alteration in the neural basis of two cognitive control operations in childhood ADHD was characterized by distinct, rather than unitary, patterns of functional abnormality. Greater between-group overlap in the neural network activated for interference suppression than in response inhibition suggests that components of cognitive control are differentially sensitive to ADHD. The ADHD children's inability to activate the caudate nucleus constitutes a core abnormality in ADHD. Observed functional abnormalities did not result from prolonged stimulant exposure, since most children were medication naive. ",

Behavioral and imaging data were collected from 15 IAD subjects (21.2±3.2years) and 15 healthy controls (HC, 22.1±3.6years). Group comparisons found that IAD subjects show higher superior temporal gyrus activations than healthy controls in switching (easy to difficult; difficult to easy) than in repeating trials. In addition, in difficult-to-easy situation, IAD subjects show higher brain activation in bilateral insula than healthy controls; in easy-to-difficult situation, IAD subjects show higher brain activation in bilateral precuneus than healthy controls. Correlations were also performed between behavioral performances and brain activities in relevant brain regions. Taken together, we concluded that IAD subjects engaged more endeavors in executive control and attention in the switching task. From another perspective, IAD subjects show impaired cognitive flexibilities. ",
pmid_15590917,"Executive dysfunction in cocaine addiction: evidence for discordant frontal, cingulate, and cerebellar activity.",,"Using a GO-NOGO response inhibition task in which working memory (WM) demands can be varied, we demonstrate that the compromised abilities of cocaine users to exert control over strong prepotent urges are associated with reduced activity in anterior cingulate and right prefrontal cortices, two regions thought to be critical for implementing cognitive control. Furthermore, unlike drug-naive controls, and opposite to the anterior cingulate pattern, cocaine users showed an over-reliance on the left cerebellum, a compensatory pattern previously seen in alcohol addiction. The results indicate that cocaine users find it difficult to inhibit their own actions, particularly when WM demands, which have been shown previously to increase during cue-induced craving for the drug, are increased. The results reveal a neuroanatomical basis for this dysexecutive component to addiction, supporting the suggested importance cognitive functions may play in prolonging abuse or predisposing users toward relapse.

However, the neural substrates of cognitive impairment in PD remain unclear. The aim of the current study was to investigate the change of local brain function in PD patients with MCI. Fifty patients with PD, including 25 PD patients with MCI (PD-MCI) and 25 PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC), and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 3D structural images, and resting state-functional MRI (rs-fMRI) were performed in all subjects. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) was measured based on the rs-fMRI images to investigate the altered local brain functions. Brain regions with decreased ReHo were located in the left posterior cerebellar lobe in PD sub-groups compared to the HC group, and the brain regions with increased ReHo were located in the limbic lobe (right precuneus/bilateral middle cingulate cortex) in PD-MCI compared with HC group. PD-MCI presented with increased ReHo in the bilateral precuneus/left superior parietal lobe and decreased ReHo in the left insula compared to PD-NC. ReHo values for the left precuneus were negatively related to neuropsychological scores, and ReHo values for the left insula were positively related to neuropsychological scores in PD subjects. The present study demonstrated abnormal spontaneous synchrony in the left insula and left precuneus in patients with PD-MCI compared to PD-NC, which might provide a novel insight into the diagnosis and clinical treatment of cognitive impairment in PD.

Currently, little is known of the mechanisms and cerebral changes that accompany those relatively rare cases of good recovery. Here, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to study the evolution of one VS patient at one month post-ictus and again twelve months later when he had recovered consciousness. fMRI was used to investigate cortical responses to passive language stimulation as well as task-induced deactivations related to the default-mode network. DTI was used to assess the integrity of the global white matter and the arcuate fasciculus. We also performed a neuropsychological assessment at the time of the second MRI examination in order to characterize the profile of cognitive deficits. fMRI analysis revealed anatomically appropriate activation to speech in both the first and the second scans but a reduced pattern of task-induced deactivations in the first scan. In the second scan, following the recovery of consciousness, this pattern became more similar to that classically described for the default-mode network. DTI analysis revealed relative preservation of the arcuate fasciculus and of the global normal-appearing white matter at both time points. The neuropsychological assessment revealed recovery of receptive linguistic functioning by 12-months post-ictus. These results suggest that the combination of different structural and functional imaging modalities may provide a powerful means for assessing the mechanisms involved in the recovery from the VS.

Understanding the neural processes underlying (uncertain) investment decisions is an important topic in neuroeconomics. We analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from an investment decision study for stimulus-related effects. We propose a new technique for identifying activated brain regions: cluster, estimation, activation, and decision method. Our analysis is focused on clusters of voxels rather than voxel units. Thus, we achieve a higher signal-to-noise ratio within the unit tested and a smaller number of hypothesis tests compared with the often used General Linear Model (GLM). We propose to first conduct the brain parcellation by applying spatially constrained spectral clustering. The information within each cluster can then be extracted by the flexible dynamic semiparametric factor model (DSFM) dimension reduction technique and finally be tested for differences in activation between conditions. This sequence of Cluster, Estimation, Activation, and Decision admits a model-free analysis of the local fMRI signal. Applying a GLM on the DSFM-based time series resulted in a significant correlation between the risk of choice options and changes in fMRI signal in the anterior insula and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Additionally, individual differences in decision-related reactions within the DSFM time series predicted individual differences in risk attitudes as modeled with the framework of the mean-variance model.

pmid_21041200,How to regulate emotion? Neural networks for reappraisal and distraction.,,"The regulation of emotion is vital for adaptive behavior in a social environment. Different strategies may be adopted to achieve successful emotion regulation, ranging from attentional control (e.g., distraction) to cognitive change (e.g., reappraisal). However, there is only scarce evidence comparing the different regulation strategies with respect to their neural mechanisms and their effects on emotional experience. We, therefore, directly compared reappraisal and distraction in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study with emotional pictures. In the distraction condition participants performed an arithmetic task, while they reinterpreted the emotional situation during reappraisal to downregulate emotional intensity. Both strategies were successful in reducing subjective emotional state ratings and lowered activity in the bilateral amygdala. Direct contrasts, however, showed a stronger decrease in amygdala activity for distraction when compared with reappraisal. While both strategies relied on common control areas in the medial and dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior parietal cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex was selectively activated for reappraisal. In contrast, the dorsal anterior cingulate and large clusters in the parietal cortex were active in the distraction condition. Functional connectivity patterns of the amygdala activation confirmed the roles of these specific activations for the 2 emotion regulation strategies. ",

However, few studies have investigated its neural correlates. In the present study, we use structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the neural correlates of maturity development in contemplative practitioners and controls. Since traits possessed by individuals with higher levels of maturity development are similar to those attributed to individuals at advanced stages of contemplative practice, we chose to investigate levels of maturity development in meditation practitioners as well as matched controls. We used the Maturity Assessment Profile (MAP) to measure maturity development in a mixed sample of participants composed of 14 long-term meditators, 16 long-term yoga practitioners, and 16 demographically matched controls. We investigated the relationship between contemplative practice and maturity development with behavioral, seed-based resting state functional connectivity, and cortical thickness analyses. The results of this study indicate that contemplative practitioners possess higher maturity development compared to a matched control group, and in addition, maturity development correlates with cortical thickness in the posterior cingulate. Furthermore, we identify a brain network implicated in theory of mind, narrative, and self-referential processing, comprising the posterior cingulate cortex, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal junction, and inferior frontal cortex, as a primary neural correlate.

We demonstrated the differences between adolescents with IGD and healthy control adolescents (HC) with respect to swear, negative and neutral word conditions. Swear words induced more activation in regions related to social interaction and emotional processing such as the superior temporal sulcus, right temporoparietal junction and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) when compared with negative words. In this study, adolescents with IGD exhibited reduced activation in the right OFC related to cognitive control and in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) related to social rejection during the swear word condition. In addition, adolescents with IGD were negatively correlated with activity in the right amygdala toward swear words, indicating the important role of the amygdala in the control of aggression in adolescents with IGD.

With the development of imaging technology in the past three decades, neuroimaging studies have provided information on the neurobiological effects, and revealed neurochemical and functional changes in the brains of both drug-addicted and non-substance addicted subjects. Imaging techniques play a more critical role in understanding the neuronal processes of addiction and will lead the direction in future research for medication development of addiction treatment, especially for non-substance addiction, which shares an increasing percentage of addiction disorder. This article will review the similarities and differences between substance and non-substance addiction based on neuroimaging studies that may provide clues for future study on these two main kinds of addiction, especially the growing non-substance addiction.

This study explores 5-HT1B in humans by examining receptor availability in vivo in subjects whose primary addiction is cocaine dependence (CD) using positron emission tomography. Study participants included 14 medically healthy subjects with CD (mean age = 41 ± 6 years) who were compared with 14 age-matched healthy control subjects (mean age = 41 ± 8 years) with no past or current history of cocaine or other illicit substance abuse. Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging followed by positron emission tomography with the highly selective 5-HT1B tracer, [(11)C]P943, for purposes of quantifying regional binding potential. Voxel-based morphometry and gray matter masking also were employed to control for potential partial volume effects. The [(11)C]P943 positron emission tomography imaging data in nine candidate regions (amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, caudate, frontal cortex, hypothalamus, pallidum, putamen, thalamus, and ventral striatum) showed significant or nearly significant reductions of regional binding potential in subjects with CD in three regions: anterior cingulate (-16%, p < .01), hypothalamus (-16%, p = .03), and frontal cortex (-7%, p = .08). Voxel-based morphometry showed significant gray matter reductions in the frontal cortex of subjects with CD. After gray matter masking, statistically significant reductions in the [(11)C]P943 regional binding potential were either retained (anterior cingulate, -14%, p = .01; hypothalamus, -20%, p < .01) or achieved (frontal cortex, -14%, p < .01). Whole-brain voxel-wise parameter estimation confirmed these results. Secondary analyses were also significant in some regions for years of cocaine and daily tobacco use. The reductions found in this study suggest that 5-HT1B receptors may contribute to the etiology or expression of CD and potentially represent a target for medication development. ",

Additionally, within the group of non-treatment-seeking cocaine-dependent individuals, we explored the role of frequently co-occurring features such as trait impulsivity (Barratt Impulsivity Scale, BIS), smoking, and depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory), as well as the role of cocaine use duration, on frontal GM volume. Smaller GM volumes in non-treatment-seeking cocaine-dependent individuals were observed in the left middle frontal gyrus. Moreover, within the group of cocaine users, trait impulsivity was associated with reduced GM volume in the right orbitofrontal cortex, the left precentral gyrus, and the right superior frontal gyrus, whereas no effect of smoking severity, depressive symptoms, or duration of cocaine use was observed on regional GM volumes. Our data show an important association between trait impulsivity and frontal GM volumes in cocaine-dependent individuals. In contrast to previous studies with treatment-seeking cocaine-dependent patients, no significant effects of smoking severity, depressive symptoms, or duration of cocaine use on frontal GM volume were observed. Reduced frontal GM volumes in non-treatment-seeking cocaine-dependent subjects are associated with trait impulsivity and are not associated with co-occurring nicotine dependence or depression. ",
pmid_17292590,Dissociating the effects of Sternberg working memory demands in prefrontal cortex.,,"Earlier neuroimaging studies of working memory (WM) have demonstrated that dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity increases as maintenance and load demand increases. However, few studies have carefully disambiguated these two WM processes at the behavioral and physiological levels. The objective of the present functional resonance imaging (fMRI) study was to map within prefrontal cortex locales that are selectively load sensitive, delay sensitive, or both. We studied 18 right-handed normal subjects with fMRI at 3 Tesla during a block design version of the Sternberg task. WM load was manipulated by varying the memory set size (3, 5, or 8 letters). The effect of memory maintenance was examined by employing two time delays (1 s and 6 s) between the letter set and probe stimuli. The DLPFC was strongly activated in load manipulation, whereas activation as a function of delay was restricted to the left premotor regions and Broca's areas. Moreover, regions of prefrontal cortex on the right (BA 46) were found to be exclusively affected by load. These results suggest the possibility that top-down modulation of attention or cognitive control at encoding and/or decisionmaking may be mediated by these areas. ",
pmid_15800188,Dissociable retrosplenial and hippocampal contributions to successful formation of survey representations.,,"During everyday navigation, humans encounter complex environments predominantly from a first-person perspective. Behavioral evidence suggests that these perceptual experiences can be used not only to acquire route knowledge but also to directly assemble map-like survey representations. Most studies of human navigation focus on the retrieval of previously learned environments, and the neural foundations of integrating sequential views into a coherent representation are not yet fully understood. We therefore used our recently introduced virtual-reality paradigm, which provides accuracy and reaction-time measurements precisely indicating the emergence of survey knowledge, and functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants repeatedly encoded a complex environment from a first-person ground-level perspective. Before the experiment, we gave specific instructions to induce survey learning, which, based on the clear evidence for emerging survey knowledge in the behavioral data from 11 participants, proved successful. Neuroimaging data revealed increasing activation across sessions only in bilateral retrosplenial cortices, thus paralleling behavioral measures of map expertise. In contrast, hippocampal activation did not follow absolute performance but rather reflected the amount of knowledge acquired in a given session. In other words, hippocampal activation was most prominent during the initial learning phase and decayed after performance had approached ceiling level. We therefore conclude that, during navigational learning, retrosplenial areas mainly serve to integrate egocentric spatial information with cues about self-motion, whereas the hippocampus is needed to incorporate new information into an emerging memory representation. ",
pmid_20533561,Dissociable brain states linked to common and creative object use.,,"Studies of conceptual processing have revealed that the prefrontal cortex is implicated in close-ended, deliberate memory retrieval, especially the left ventrolateral prefrontal regions. However, much of human thought-particularly that which is characterized as creative-requires more open-ended, spontaneous memory retrieval. To explore the neural systems that support conceptual processing under these two distinct circumstances, we obtained functional magnetic resonance images from 24 participants either while retrieving the common use of an everyday object (e.g., ""blowing your nose,"" in response to a picture of a tissue) or while generating a creative (i.e., uncommon but plausible) use for it (e.g., ""protective padding in a package""). The patterns of activation during open- and closed-ended tasks were reliably different, with regard to the magnitude of anterior versus posterior activation. Specifically, the close-ended task (i.e., Common Use task) reliably activated regions of lateral prefrontal cortex, whereas the open-ended task (i.e., Uncommon Use task) reliably activated regions of occipito-temporal cortex. Furthermore, there was variability across subjects in the types of responses produced on the open-ended task that was associated with the magnitude of activation in the middle occipital gyrus on this task. The present experiment is the first to demonstrate a dynamic tradeoff between anterior frontal and posterior occipitotemporal regions brought about by the close- or open-ended task demands. ",

Prosocial
fMRI","Across species, including non-human primates, rodents, and humans, prosocial behavior, the act of helping others, is preferentially provided to members of one's own group. Whereas a particularly ubiquitous example of this is kinship, whereby humans and animals expend greater resources and take more risks for their own kin, in-group prosocial behavior has been demonstrated among diverse shared social groups, including race and culture. In the current study, we made group membership salient by recruiting Chinese and American participants to engage in a prosocial decision-making task during fMRI with an American and Chinese confederate. We found across all participants that donations to the in-group relative to out-group was associated with increased activation in the ventral striatum. Moreover, participants with a greater sense of group identity and Chinese participants relative to American participants, showed heightened activation in self-control (VLPFC, ACC) and mentalizing (TPJ, DMPFC) regions when contributing to the out-group relative to in-group. Our findings provide novel evidence about the neural mechanisms involved in intergroup prosocial behavior. ",
pmid_20603219,Neural correlates of real-world route learning.,,"Classical theories of spatial microgenesis (Siegel and White, 1975) posit that information about landmarks and the paths between them is acquired prior to the establishment of more holistic survey-level representations. To test this idea, we examined the neural and behavioral correlates of landmark and path encoding during a real-world route learning episode. Subjects were taught a novel 3 km route around the University of Pennsylvania campus and then brought to the laboratory where they performed a recognition task that required them to discriminate between on-route and off-route buildings. Each building was preceded by a masked prime, which could either be the building that immediately preceded the target building along the route or immediately succeeded it. Consistent with previous reports using a similar paradigm in a virtual environment (Janzen and Weststeijn, 2007), buildings at navigational decision points (DPs) were more easily recognized than non-DP buildings and recognition was facilitated by in-route vs. against-route primes. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected during the recognition task revealed two effects of interest: first, greater response to DP vs. non-DP buildings in a wide network of brain regions previously implicated in spatial processing; second, a significant interaction between building location (DP vs. non-DP) and route direction (in-route vs. against-route) in a retrosplenial/parietal-occipital sulcus region previously labeled the retrosplenial complex (RSC). These results indicate that newly learned real-world routes are coded in terms of paths between decision points and suggest that the RSC may be a critical locus for integrating landmark and path information. ",
pmid_19500604,Impaired recognition of emotions from body movements is associated with elevated motion coherence thresholds in autism spectrum disorders.,,"Recent research has confirmed that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have difficulties in recognizing emotions from body movements. Difficulties in perceiving coherent motion are also common in ASD. Yet it is unknown whether these two impairments are related. Thirteen adults with ASD and 16 age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) adults classified basic emotions from point-light and full-light displays of body movements and discriminated the direction of coherent motion in random-dot kinematograms. The ASD group was reliably less accurate in classifying emotions regardless of stimulus display type, and in perceiving coherent motion. As predicted, ASD individuals with higher motion coherence thresholds were less accurate in classifying emotions from body movements, especially in the point-light displays; this relationship was not evident for the TD group. The results are discussed in relation to recent models of biological motion processing and known abnormalities in the neural substrates of motion and social perception in ASD. ",

fMRI
fear conditioning
skin conductance","The extinction of a previously conditioned response can be modulated through cognitive processes, including feature-based information, and explicit instruction. Here, we introduce a selective extinction through cognitive evaluation (SECE) task in which information is cognitively evaluated on a trial-by-trial basis to ascertain the extinction contingencies. Participants were conditioned to expect an electric shock during the presentation of one of two letters (CS+/CS-). During the SECE task, the letters were presented within words belonging to two categories, one of which indicated safety (COG-_CS+ trials), while risk of shock was maintained for the other category (COG+_CS+ trials). Skin conductance responses indicated that participants reduced their response to COG-_CS+ trials compared to COG+_CS+ trials. Clusters in bilateral insula and anterior cingulate cortex showed activation for COG+_CS+ trials that was reduced for COG-_CS+ trials. A network of brain regions, including left inferior frontal gyrus, and bilateral temporal and parietal cortices showed greater activation for COG-_CS+ versus COG+_CS+ trials. This is consistent with the semantic processing and decision-making necessary to evaluate the trial contingencies. We compared activation in the SECE task to activation in a cognitive reappraisal task in which participants were asked to attend to, or regulate their emotional reactions to affective IAPS images. This task replicated prefrontal activation seen in previous reappraisal studies. A voxelwise conjunction analysis found no overlap between the cognitive reappraisal and the SECE task, but we did find evidence for common activation in follow-up ROI analyses, supporting the idea of common lateral prefrontal mechanisms involved in both processes. ",
pmid_17218478,Cognitive coping style modulates neural responses to emotional faces in healthy humans: a 3-T FMRI study.,,"Repression designates coping strategies that aim to shield the organism from distressing stimuli by disregarding their aversive characteristics. In contrast, sensitization comprises coping strategies that are employed to reduce situational uncertainty such as analyzing the environment. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to study neural correlates of coping styles during the perception of threatening and nonthreatening socially relevant information. Pictures of human faces bearing fearful (ambiguously threatening), angry (unambiguously threatening), happy (nonthreatening), and neutral expressions were presented masked and unmasked. Two groups of subjects were examined who were defined as consistent repressors versus consistent sensitizers with the Mainz Coping Inventory. Sensitizers tended to exhibit stronger neural responses in the amygdala to unmasked fearful faces compared with repressors. Overall, repressors were cortically more responsive to fearful (ambiguously threatening) and happy (nonthreatening) facial expressions than sensitizers, whereas sensitizers presented an enhanced responsivity to angry faces in several prefrontal areas, that is, unambiguously threatening expressions. Results from time series analyses suggest that sensitizers could exhibit less top-down cortical regulation of the amygdala than repressors in the processing of fearful faces. An increased responsivity of the amygdala to ambiguously threatening stimuli may represent a biological determinant of sensitizers' feelings of uncertainty. ",

fMRI","The ability to interpret agents' intent from their actions is a vital skill in successful social interaction. However, individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been found to have difficulty in attributing intentions to others. The present study investigated the neural mechanisms of inferring intentions from actions in individuals with ASD. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired from 21 high-functioning young adults with ASD and 22 typically developing (TD) control participants, while making judgments about the means (how an action is performed) and intention (why an action is performed) of a model's actions. Across both groups of participants, the middle and superior temporal cortex, extending to temporoparietal junction, and posterior cingulate cortex, responded significantly to inferring the intent of an action, while inferior parietal lobule and occipital cortices were active for judgments about the means of an action. Participants with ASD had significantly reduced activation in calcarine sulcus and significantly increased activation in left inferior frontal gyrus, compared to TD peers, while attending to the intentions of actions. Also, ASD participants had weaker functional connectivity between frontal and posterior temporal regions while processing intentions. These results suggest that processing actions and intentions may not be mutually exclusive, with reliance on mirroring and mentalizing mechanisms mediating action understanding. Overall, inferring information about others' actions involves activation of the mirror neuron system and theory-of-mind regions, and this activation (and the synchrony between activated brain regions) appears altered in young adults with ASD.

pmid_22669034,Flexible rule use: common neural substrates in children and adults.,,"Flexible rule-guided behavior develops gradually, and requires the ability to remember the rules, switch between them as needed, and implement them in the face of competing information. Our goals for this study were twofold: first, to assess whether these components of rule-guided behavior are separable at the neural level, and second, to identify age-related differences in one or more component that could support the emergence of increasingly accurate and flexible rule use over development. We collected event-related fMRI data while 36 children aged 8-13 and adults aged 20-27 performed a task that manipulated rule representation, rule switching, and stimulus incongruency. Several regions - left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), left posterior parietal cortex, and pre-supplementary motor area - were engaged by both the rule representation and the rule-switching manipulations. These regions were engaged similarly across age groups, though contrasting timecourses of activation in left DLPFC suggest that children updated task rules more slowly than did adults. These findings support the idea that common networks can contribute to a variety of executive functions, and that some developmental changes take the form of changes in temporal dynamics rather than qualitative changes in the network of brain regions engaged. ",
pmid_16624961,Amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex are inversely coupled during regulation of negative affect and predict the diurnal pattern of cortisol secretion among older adults.,,"Among younger adults, the ability to willfully regulate negative affect, enabling effective responses to stressful experiences, engages regions of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the amygdala. Because regions of PFC and the amygdala are known to influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, here we test whether PFC and amygdala responses during emotion regulation predict the diurnal pattern of salivary cortisol secretion. We also test whether PFC and amygdala regions are engaged during emotion regulation in older (62- to 64-year-old) rather than younger individuals. We measured brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging as participants regulated (increased or decreased) their affective responses or attended to negative picture stimuli. We also collected saliva samples for 1 week at home for cortisol assay. Consistent with previous work in younger samples, increasing negative affect resulted in ventral lateral, dorsolateral, and dorsomedial regions of PFC and amygdala activation. In contrast to previous work, decreasing negative affect did not produce the predicted robust pattern of higher PFC and lower amygdala activation. Individuals demonstrating the predicted effect (decrease < attend in the amygdala), however, exhibited higher signal in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) for the same contrast. Furthermore, participants displaying higher VMPFC and lower amygdala signal when decreasing compared with the attention control condition evidenced steeper, more normative declines in cortisol over the course of the day. Individual differences yielded the predicted link between brain function while reducing negative affect in the laboratory and diurnal regulation of endocrine activity in the home environment. ",
pmid_18195362,Marketing actions can modulate neural representations of experienced pleasantness.,,"Despite the importance and pervasiveness of marketing, almost nothing is known about the neural mechanisms through which it affects decisions made by individuals. We propose that marketing actions, such as changes in the price of a product, can affect neural representations of experienced pleasantness. We tested this hypothesis by scanning human subjects using functional MRI while they tasted wines that, contrary to reality, they believed to be different and sold at different prices. Our results show that increasing the price of a wine increases subjective reports of flavor pleasantness as well as blood-oxygen-level-dependent activity in medial orbitofrontal cortex, an area that is widely thought to encode for experienced pleasantness during experiential tasks. The paper provides evidence for the ability of marketing actions to modulate neural correlates of experienced pleasantness and for the mechanisms through which the effect operates. ",
pmid_21676130,A functional MRI study of working memory in adolescents and young adults at genetic risk for bipolar disorder: preliminary findings.,,"In this report, we seek to (i) identify a potential neuroimaging endophenotype for bipolar disorder (BD) in emotion regulatory and autonomic circuitry in young first-degree relatives of persons with BD; and (ii) replicate our previous work identifying the functional neuroanatomy of working memory (WM) in an older sample of relatives of persons with BD. Ten adolescent and young adult (age 13-24) unmedicated, non-ill, first-degree relatives of persons with BD (RELS) and 10 demographically comparable healthy controls performed a 2-back WM task and a 0-back control task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). fMRI data were collected on a 1.5 Tesla scanner and analyzed using SPM-2. Mood was assessed on the day of scanning. The groups did not differ on any demographic, neuropsychological, or in-scanner task performance variables. In contrast to controls, RELS showed (i) weak task-dependent modulation activity in the cerebellar vermis (CV), insula, and amygdala/parahippocampal region, and (ii) exaggerated modulation of activity in the frontopolar cortex and brainstem, even after controlling for potential confounders. Many of the group differences were driven by differences in activity in the low-level (0-back) baseline task. Young, unmedicated RELS exhibited altered task-dependent modulation of frontopolar, CV, and insula activity during WM, especially during the low-level (0-back) baseline task. Results are largely consistent with our initial study of older adult RELS, suggesting these alterations may represent biomarkers of genetic risk for BD. ",
pmid_24469099,Altered brain activation during response inhibition and error processing in subjects with Internet gaming disorder: a functional magnetic imaging study.,,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impulsivity and brain correlates of response inhibition and error processing among subjects with Internet gaming disorder (IGD). We evaluated the response inhibition and error processing by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in subjects with IGD and controls. Twenty-six men with IGD for at least 2 years and 23 controls with no history of IGD were recruited as the IGD and control groups, respectively. All subjects performed the event-related designed Go/No-go task under fMRI and completed questionnaires related to Internet addiction and impulsivity. The IGD group exhibited a higher score for impulsivity than the control group. The IGD group also exhibited higher brain activation when processing response inhibition over the left orbital frontal lobe and bilateral caudate nucleus than controls. Both the IGD and control groups exhibited activation of the insula and anterior cingulate cortex during error processing. The activation over the right insula was lower in the subjects with IGD than the control group. Our results support the fact that the fronto-striatal network involved in response inhibition, and the salience network, anchored by the anterior cingulate and insula, contributes to error processing. Further, adults with IGD have impaired insular function in error processing and greater activation of the fronto-striatal network in order to maintain their response inhibition performance. ",

Our study aims at filling this gap by exploring empathy abilities in a group of 28 patients with high-functioning ASD and 28 gender-, age- and education-matched non-autistic subjects, for the first time by means of functional neuroimaging (fMRI). In an event-related fMRI paradigm, emotional (""E"") and neutral (""N"") video clips presented actors telling self-related short stories. After each clip, participants were asked to indicate their own emotion and its intensity as well as the emotion and intensity perceived for the actor. Behaviorally, we found significantly less empathic responses in the overall ASD group compared with non-autistic subjects, and inadequate emotion recognition for the neutral clips in the female ASD group compared with healthy women. Neurally, increased activation of the bilateral medial frontal gyrus was found in male patients compared with female patients, a pattern which was not present in the non-autistic group. Additionally, autistic women exhibited decreased activation of midbrain and limbic regions compared with non-autistic women, whereas there was no significant difference within the male group. While we did not find a fundamental empathic deficit in autistic patients, our data propose different ways of processing empathy in autistic men and women, suggesting stronger impairments in cognitive aspects of empathy/theory of mind for men, and alterations of social reciprocity for women.

Noun deficits are associated with lesions in anterior temporal regions while verb deficits arise from left inferior frontal lesions. However, neuroimaging studies do not unequivocally support this account, with only some studies supporting claims for regional specialization. We carried out two PET studies to determine whether there is any regional specialization for the processing of nouns and verbs. One study used the lexical decision task and the other used a more semantically demanding task, i.e. semantic categorization. We found robust activation of a semantic network extending from left inferior frontal cortex into the inferior temporal lobe, but no differences as a function of word class. We interpret these data within the framework of cognitive accounts in which conceptual knowledge is represented within a non-differentiated distributed system. ",

Five healthy controls and 6 Rome II diagnosed IBS patients underwent psychological testing followed by rectal balloon distention while brain neural activity was measured with O-15 water positron emission tomography (PET) before and after a brief regimen of CT. Pre-treatment resting state scans, without distention, were compared to post-treatment scans using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Neural activity in the parahippocampal gyrus and inferior portion of the right cortex cingulate were reduced in the post-treatment scan, compared to pre-treatment (x, y, z coordinates in MNI standard space were -30, -12, -30, P=0.017; 6, 34, -8, P=0.023, respectively). Blood flow values at these two sites in the controls were intermediate between those in the pre- and post-treatment IBS patients. Limbic activity changes were accompanied by significant improvements in GI symptoms (e.g., pain, bowel dysfunction) and psychological functioning (e.g., anxiety, worry). The left pons (-2, -26, -28, P=0.04) showed decreased neural activity which was correlated with post-treatment anxiety scores. Changes in neural activity of cortical-limbic regions that subserve hypervigilance and emotion regulation may represent biologically oriented change mechanisms that mediate symptom improvement of CT for IBS.

This study aimed to determine the neural basis of the predictive and experiential components of anticipatory pleasure in schizophrenia. A hedonic rating task was performed by 15 patients with schizophrenia and 17 controls while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants evaluated the level of pleasantness for the preview/predictive phase, comprising a narration and adjunctive audiovisual stimuli for pleasurable experience, and the subsequent viewing/experiential phase, comprising a video clip for a pleasant event. A significant group-by-phase interaction was seen in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and caudate, resulting from reduced activations in patients during the preview phase. Patients showed significantly reduced activation in the frontopolar cortex and rostral ACC during the preview phase. The signal changes in the caudate and frontopolar cortex were associated with increase in hedonic response during the sequential pleasure experiences. Augmentation of hedonic enjoyment between the predictive and experiential stages of anticipatory pleasure is reduced in schizophrenia because of diminished activity in the reward-related regions during the prediction of pleasure. During cued-emotional experiences of anticipatory pleasure, patients seem to have difficulties in the integration of emotional information. ",
pmid_21440645,"Differences in ""bottom-up"" and ""top-down"" neural activity in current and former cigarette smokers: Evidence for neural substrates which may promote nicotine abstinence through increased cognitive control.",,"Drug-related stimuli, through conditioning, are thought to acquire incentive motivational properties that code possible reward availability and elicit an attentional bias, possibly through increased ""bottom-up"" neural processing. The processes underlying this attentional bias are considered important in the maintenance of addiction, and crucially, in relapse among substance users attempting to remain abstinent. Equally, impaired ""top-down"" cognitive control may impair the ability to restrain ""bottom-up"" pre-potent behaviours, such as drug use, following exposure to drug-related stimuli. Two experiments sought to identify the neural loci of bottom-up/top-down processing during fMRI. Experiment 1 utilised an attentional bias paradigm to examine the behavioural and neural responses to neutral, emotionally evocative and smoking-related cues in control (n=13), ex-smoking (n=10 - abstinent >12months) and smoking (n=13 - mean >6.5years of use) groups. Experiment 2 used a go/no-go paradigm to examine the neural correlates of motor response inhibition and error monitoring in the same sample. The results of Experiment 1 demonstrated that, across conditions, current smokers had significantly less neural activity in cortical but significantly more activity in subcortical areas compared to both controls and ex-smokers. Ex-smokers exhibited more neural activity than both control and smoker groups in prefrontal cortical regions. Similarly, Experiment 2 revealed that smokers had reduced neural activity in prefrontal cortical regions during motor response inhibition compared to controls while ex-smokers demonstrated greater neural activity in prefrontal cortical regions compared to both controls and smokers during error monitoring. The results reveal cortical and subcortical differences between current smokers and controls and a general pattern of increased prefrontal cortical activity in ex-smokers. These findings may suggest that elevated topdown control might be an important characteristic of successful abstinence in individuals formerly dependent on nicotine. ",

Few studies, however, have examined the extent to which unaffected youth at familial risk for BD exhibit such alterations. Using an fMRI emotional working memory paradigm, we investigated the functioning of fronto-limbic systems in fifteen healthy bipolar offspring (8-17 years old) with at least one parent diagnosed with BD (HBO), and 16 age-matched healthy control (HC) participants. Neural activity and functional connectivity analyses focused on a priori neural regions supporting emotion processing (amygdala and ventral striatum) and voluntary emotion regulation (ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)). Relative to HC, HBO exhibited greater right VLPFC (BA47) activation in response to positive emotional distracters and reduced VLPFC modulation of the amygdala to both the positive and negative emotional distracters; there were no group differences in connectivity for the neutral distracters. These findings suggest that alterations in the functioning of fronto-limbic systems implicated in voluntary emotion regulation are present in unaffected bipolar offspring. Future longitudinal studies are needed to determine the extent to which such alterations represent neurodevelopmental markers of risk for future onset of BD. ",

There has not, however, been a comprehensive study, including several inhibition tasks and several working memory tasks, performed by the same subjects. In the present study, 11 healthy adult subjects completed separate blocks of 3 inhibition tasks (a stop task, a go/no-go task and a flanker task), and 2 working memory tasks (one spatial and one verbal). Activation common to all 5 tasks was identified in the right inferior frontal gyrus, and, at a lower threshold, also the right middle frontal gyrus and right parietal regions (BA 40 and BA 7). Left inferior frontal regions of interest (ROIs) showed a significant conjunction between all tasks except the flanker task. The present study could not pinpoint the specific function of each common region, but the parietal region identified here has previously been consistently related to working memory storage and the right inferior frontal gyrus has been associated with inhibition in both lesion and imaging studies. These results support the notion that inhibitory and working memory tasks involve common neural components, which may provide a neural basis for the interrelationship between the two systems. ",

resting-state fMRI","Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have demonstrated the disruptions of multiple brain networks in tinnitus patients. Nonetheless, several studies found no differences in network processing between tinnitus patients and healthy controls (HCs). Its neural bases are poorly understood. To identify aberrant brain network architecture involved in chronic tinnitus, we compared the resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) patterns of tinnitus patients and HCs. Chronic tinnitus patients (n = 24) with normal hearing thresholds and age-, sex-, education- and hearing threshold-matched HCs (n = 22) participated in the current study and underwent the rs-fMRI scanning. We used degree centrality (DC) to investigate functional connectivity (FC) strength of the whole-brain network and Granger causality to analyze effective connectivity in order to explore directional aspects involved in tinnitus. Compared to HCs, we found significantly increased network centrality in bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG). Unidirectionally, the left SFG revealed increased effective connectivity to the left middle orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), left posterior lobe of cerebellum (PLC), left postcentral gyrus, and right middle occipital gyrus (MOG) while the right SFG exhibited enhanced effective connectivity to the right supplementary motor area (SMA). In addition, the effective connectivity from the bilateral SFG to the OFC and SMA showed positive correlations with tinnitus distress. Rs-fMRI provides a new and novel method for identifying aberrant brain network architecture. Chronic tinnitus patients have disrupted FC strength and causal connectivity mostly in non-auditory regions, especially the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The current findings will provide a new perspective for understanding the neuropathophysiological mechanisms in chronic tinnitus. ",

While these studies have examined the effect of short-term, interpersonal or cognitive-behavioural psychotherapy, the effect of long-term, psychodynamic intervention has never been assessed. Here, we investigated recurrently depressed (DSM-IV) unmedicated outpatients (N = 16) and control participants matched for sex, age, and education (N = 17) before and after 15 months of psychodynamic psychotherapy. Participants were scanned at two time points, during which presentations of attachment-related scenes with neutral descriptions alternated with descriptions containing personal core sentences previously extracted from an attachment interview. Outcome measure was the interaction of the signal difference between personal and neutral presentations with group and time, and its association with symptom improvement during therapy. Signal associated with processing personalized attachment material varied in patients from baseline to endpoint, but not in healthy controls. Patients showed a higher activation in the left anterior hippocampus/amygdala, subgenual cingulate, and medial prefrontal cortex before treatment and a reduction in these areas after 15 months. This reduction was associated with improvement in depressiveness specifically, and in the medial prefrontal cortex with symptom improvement more generally. This is the first study documenting neurobiological changes in circuits implicated in emotional reactivity and control after long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy. ",
pmid_15229057,Medial prefrontal cortex activity associated with symptom provocation in eating disorders.,,"The authors sought to identify neural correlates of eating disorders in order to contribute to the debate on the genesis and classification of eating disorders and provide endophenotypes for genetic research. Twenty-six female patients with eating disorders (10 with bulimia nervosa, 16 with anorexia nervosa) and 19 healthy female comparison subjects matched for age and education were presented with food and aversive emotional images while brain activity was recorded with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Women with eating disorders identified the food stimuli as threatening and disgusting. In response to these stimuli, the women with eating disorders had greater activation in the left medial orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices and less activation in the lateral prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal lobule, and cerebellum, relative to the comparison group. In addition, women with bulimia nervosa had less activation in the lateral and apical prefrontal cortex, relative to the comparison group. Between-group differences in response to nonspecific emotional stimuli were found in the occipital cortex, parietal cortex, and cerebellum. A medial prefrontal response to symptom-provoking stimuli was identified as a common feature of anorexia and bulimia nervosa. This finding supports a conceptualization of eating disorders as being transdiagnostic at the neural level. The abnormal prefrontal reaction is associated with symptom-related material, whereas the occipital and cerebellar differences are nonspecific. An abnormal propensity to activate medial prefrontal circuits in response to inappropriate stimuli is common to eating, obsessive-compulsive, and addictive disorders and may account for the compulsive features of behavior in these conditions.

self-disorder
sensory and perceptual system
temporal variability","Schizophrenia is thought as a self-disorder with dysfunctional brain connectivity. This self-disorder is often attributed to high-order cognitive impairment. Yet due to the frequent report of sensorial and perceptual deficits, it has been hypothesized that self-disorder in schizophrenia is dysfunctional communication between sensory and cognitive processes. To further verify this assumption, the present study comprehensively examined dynamic reconfigurations of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in schizophrenia at voxel level, region level, and network levels (102 patients vs. 124 controls). We found patients who show consistently increased rsFC variability in sensory and perceptual system, including visual network, sensorimotor network, attention network, and thalamus at all the three levels. However, decreased variability in high-order networks, such as default mode network and frontal-parietal network were only consistently observed at region and network levels. Taken together, these findings highlighted the rudimentary role of elevated instability of information communication in sensory and perceptual system and attenuated whole-brain integration of high-order network in schizophrenia, which provided novel neural evidence to support the hypothesis of disrupted perceptual and cognitive function in schizophrenia. The foci of effects also highlighted that targeting perceptual deficits can be regarded as the key to enhance our understanding of pathophysiology in schizophrenia and promote new treatment intervention.

pmid_25533997,Inverse fluoxetine effects on inhibitory brain activation in non-comorbid boys with ADHD and with ASD.,,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are often comorbid and have both performance and brain dysfunctions during motor response inhibition. Serotonin agonists modulate motor response inhibition and have shown positive behavioural effects in both disorders. We therefore used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the so far unknown shared and disorder-specific inhibitory brain dysfunctions in these two disorders, as well as the effects of a single dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. Age-matched boys with ADHD (18), ASD (19) and healthy controls (25) were compared with fMRI during a stop task measuring motor inhibition. Patients were scanned twice, under either an acute dose of fluoxetine or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised design. Repeated measures analyses within patients assessed drug effects. To test for potential normalisation effects of brain dysfunctions, patients under each drug condition were compared to controls. Under placebo, relative to controls, ASD boys showed overactivation in left and right inferior frontal cortex (IFC), while ADHD boys showed disorder-specific underactivation in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and basal ganglia. Under fluoxetine, the prefrontal dysfunctions were no longer observed, due to inverse effects of fluoxetine on these activations: fluoxetine downregulated IFC and OFC activation in ASD but upregulated them in ADHD. The findings show that fluoxetine normalises frontal lobe dysfunctions in both disorders via inverse effects, downregulating abnormally increased frontal activation in ASD and upregulating abnormally decreased frontal activation in ADHD, potentially reflecting inverse baseline serotonin levels in both disorders.

pmid_20561955,Neural substrates of phasic alertness: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study.,,"The ""warning effect"" refers to the decrease in motor response reaction times to a target when its presentation is preceded by a stimulus indicating that the target will appear shortly. We hypothesized that cue presentation phasically enhances alertness, which in turn facilitates the preparation of a motor response. To test this hypothesis, we conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging during a Go/NoGo task with a warning stimulus. Fifteen subjects completed a visual Go/NoGo task, and 12 completed an analogous task in the auditory modality. After a warning stimulus was presented, a Go or NoGo stimulus was presented with equal probability. Both auditory and visual warning stimuli activated the midbrain, thalamus, and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) extending to the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA). The warning-related activation in the pre-SMA and thalamus was greater when warnings were followed by Go events with faster reaction times than when followed by events with slower reaction times. The midbrain, thalamus, and ACC are known to be associated with vigilance or intrinsic alertness, and the pre-SMA is involved in movement selection and preparation. Thus, the warning effect may be partly mediated by the potentiation of the pre-SMA through the midbrain-thalamus-ACC alerting network. ",

trust game","Trust in reciprocity (TR) is defined as the risky decision to invest valued resources in another party with the hope of mutual benefit. Several fMRI studies have investigated the neural correlates of TR in one-shot and multiround versions of the investment game (IG). However, an overall characterization of the underlying neural networks remains elusive. Here, a coordinate-based meta-analysis was employed (activation likelihood estimation method, 30 articles) to investigate consistent brain activations in each of the IG stages (i.e., the trust, reciprocity and feedback stage). Results showed consistent activations in the anterior insula (AI) during trust decisions in the one-shot IG and decisions to reciprocate in the multiround IG, likely related to representations of aversive feelings. Moreover, decisions to reciprocate also consistently engaged the intraparietal sulcus, probably involved in evaluations of the reciprocity options. On the contrary, trust decisions in the multiround IG consistently activated the ventral striatum, likely associated with reward prediction error signals. Finally, the dorsal striatum was found consistently recruited during the feedback stage of the multiround IG, likely related to reinforcement learning. In conclusion, our results indicate different neural networks underlying trust, reciprocity, and feedback learning. These findings suggest that although decisions to trust and reciprocate may elicit aversive feelings likely evoked by the uncertainty about the decision outcomes and the pressing requirements of social standards, multiple interactions allow people to build interpersonal trust for cooperation via a learning mechanism by which they arguably learn to distinguish trustworthy from untrustworthy partners.

Healthy aging
Proactive response inhibition
Reactive response inhibition","Two distinct forms of response inhibition may underlie observed deficits in response inhibition in aging. We assessed whether age-related neurocognitive impairments in response inhibition reflect deficient reactive inhibition (outright stopping) or also deficient proactive inhibition (anticipatory response slowing), which might be particularly evident with high information load. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in young (n = 25, age range 18-32) and older adults (n = 23, 61-74) with a stop-signal task. Relative to young adults, older adults exhibited impaired reactive inhibition (i.e., longer stop-signal reaction time) and increased blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal for successful versus unsuccessful inhibition in the left frontal cortex and cerebellum. Furthermore, older adults also exhibited impaired proactive slowing, but only as a function of information load. This load-dependent behavioral deficit was accompanied by a failure to increase blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal under high information load in lateral frontal cortex, presupplementary motor area and striatum. Our findings suggest that inhibitory deficits in older adults are caused both by reduced stopping abilities and by diminished preparation capacity during information overload. ",
pmid_16169136,Neural correlates of temporal-order judgments versus those of spatial-location: deactivation of hippocampus may facilitate spatial performance.,,"The retrieval of temporal-order versus spatial-location information was investigated using fMRI. The primary finding in the hippocampus proper, seen in region of interest analyses, was an increase in BOLD signal intensity for temporal retrieval, and a decrease in signal intensity for spatial retrieval, relative to baseline. The negative BOLD signal change with spatial memory processing, while unexpected, is consistent with the recent fMRI literature indicating decreased BOLD can be associated with neuronal activation, and it is argued that the deactivation observed here may facilitate spatial performance. Spatial-location judgments also yielded a stronger (positive) response in the right midfrontal gyrus, while temporal-order judgments (autobiographic condition only) showed greater activity in the left superior temporal gyrus, suggesting greater working memory demands and greater semantization for each judgment type, respectively. Finally, all conditions activated the left midfrontal gyrus, although autobiographic memories showed additional activity in the medial frontal gyrus. ",

White matter hyperintensities","Amnestic mild cognitive impairment can be further classified as single-domain aMCI (SD-aMCI) with isolated memory deficit, or multi-domain aMCI (MD-aMCI) if memory deficit is combined with impairment in other cognitive domains. Prior studies reported these clinical subtypes presumably differ in etiology. Thus, we aimed to explore the possible mechanisms between different aMCI subtypes by assessing alteration in brain activity and brain vasculature, and their relations with CSF AD biomarkers. 49 healthy controls, 32 SD-aMCI, and 32 MD-aMCI, who had undergone structural scans, resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) scans and neuropsychological evaluations, were identified. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) was employed to analyze regional synchronization. Periventricular white matter hyperintensities (PWMH) and deep WMH (DWMH) volume of each participant was quantitatively assessed. AD biomarkers from CSF were also measured. SD-aMCI showed decreased ReHo in medial temporal gyrus (MTG), and increased ReHo in lingual gyrus (LG) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) relative to controls. MD-aMCI showed decreased ReHo, mostly located in precuneus (PCu), LG and postcentral gyrus (PCG), relative to SD-aMCI and controls. As for microvascular disease, MD-aMCI patients had more PWMH burden than SD-aMCI and controls. Correlation analyses indicated mean ReHo in differenced regions were related with memory, language, and executive function in aMCI patients. However, no significant associations between PWMH and behavioral data were found. The Aβ level was related with the ReHo value of STG in SD-aMCI. MD-aMCI displayed different patterns of abnormal regional synchronization and more severe PWMH burden compared with SD-aMCI. Therefore aMCI is not a uniform disease entity, and MD-aMCI group may show more complicated pathologies than SD-aMCI group. ",
pmid_21350872,Converging evidence for the advantage of dynamic facial expressions.,,"Neuroimaging evidence suggests that dynamic facial expressions elicit greater activity than static face stimuli in brain structures associated with social cognition, interpreted as greater ecological validity. However, a quantitative meta-analysis of brain activity associated with dynamic facial expressions is lacking. The current study investigated, using three fMRI experiments, activity elicited by (a) dynamic and static happy faces, (b) dynamic and static happy and angry faces, and (c) dynamic faces and dynamic flowers. In addition, using activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analysis, we determined areas concordant across published studies that (a) used dynamic faces and (b) specifically compared dynamic and static emotional faces. The middle temporal gyri (Experiment 1) and superior temporal sulci (STS; Experiment 1 and 2) were more active for dynamic than static faces. In contrasts with the baseline the amygdalae were more active for dynamic faces (Experiment 1 and 2) and the fusiform gyri were active for all conditions (all Experiments). The ALE meta-analyses revealed concordant activation in all of these regions as well as in areas associated with cognitive manipulations (inferior frontal gyri). Converging data from the experiments and the meta-analyses suggest that dynamic facial stimuli elicit increased activity in regions associated with interpretation of social signals and emotional processing.

Transdiagnostic
fMRI","The neural mechanisms associated with anhedonia treatment response are poorly understood. Additionally, no study has investigated changes in resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) accompanying psychosocial treatment for anhedonia. We evaluated a novel psychotherapy, Behavioral Activation Therapy for Anhedonia (BATA, n = 38) relative to Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT, n = 35) in a medication-free, transdiagnostic, anhedonic sample in a parallel randomized controlled trial. Participants completed up to 15 sessions of therapy and up to four 7T MRI scans before, during, and after treatment (n = 185 scans). Growth curve models estimated change over time in anhedonia and in rsFC using average region-of-interest (ROI)-to-ROI connectivity within the default mode network (DMN), frontoparietal network (FPN), salience network, and reward network. Changes in rsFC from pre- to post-treatment were further evaluated using whole-network seed-to-voxel and ROI-to-ROI edgewise analyses. Growth curve models showed significant reductions in anhedonia symptoms and in average rsFC within the DMN and FPN over time, across BATA and MBCT. There were no differences in anhedonia reductions between treatments. Within-person, changes in average rsFC were unrelated to changes in anhedonia. Between-person, higher than average FPN rsFC was related to less anhedonia across timepoints. Seed-to-voxel and edgewise rsFC analyses corroborated reductions within the DMN and between the DMN and FPN over time, across the sample. Reductions in rsFC within the DMN, FPN, and between these networks co-occurred with anhedonia improvement across two psychosocial treatments for anhedonia. Future anhedonia clinical trials with a waitlist control group should disambiguate treatment versus time-related effects on rsFC. ",
pmid_17492693,A navigational guidance system in the human brain.,,"Finding your way in large-scale space requires knowing where you currently are and how to get to your goal destination. While much is understood about the neural basis of one's current position during navigation, surprisingly little is known about how the human brain guides navigation to goals. Computational accounts argue that specific brain regions support navigational guidance by coding the proximity and direction to the goal, but empirical evidence for such mechanisms is lacking. Here, we scanned subjects with functional magnetic resonance imaging as they navigated to goal destinations in a highly accurate virtual simulation of a real city. Brain activity was then analyzed in combination with metric measures of proximity and direction to goal destinations that were derived from each individual subject's coordinates at every second of navigation. We found that activity in the medial prefrontal cortex was positively correlated, and activity in a right subicular/entorhinal region was negatively correlated with goal proximity. By contrast, activity in bilateral posterior parietal cortex was correlated with egocentric direction to goals. Our results provide empirical evidence for a navigational guidance system in the human brain, and define more precisely the contribution of these three brain regions to human navigation. In addition, these findings may also have wider implications for how the brain monitors and integrates different types of information in the service of goal-directed behavior in general. ",
pmid_25880206,Cerebral response to subject's own name showed high prognostic value in traumatic vegetative state.,,"Previous studies have shown the prognostic value of stimulation elicited blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal in traumatic patients in vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS). However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have focused on the relevance of etiology and level of consciousness in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) when explaining the relationship between BOLD signal and both outcome and signal variability. We herein propose a study in a large sample of traumatic and non-traumatic DOC patients in order to ascertain the relevance of etiology and level of consciousness in the variability and prognostic value of a stimulation-elicited BOLD signal. 66 patients were included, and the response of each subject to his/her own name said by a familiar voice (SON-FV) was recorded using fMRI; 13 patients were scanned twice in the same day, respecting the exact same conditions in both cases. A behavioral follow-up program was carried out at 3, 6, and 12 months after scanning. Of the 39 VS/UWS patients, 12 (75%) out of 16 patients with higher level activation patterns recovered to minimally conscious state (MCS) or emergence from MCS (EMCS) and 17 (74%) out of 23 patients with lower level activation patterns or no activation had a negative outcome. Taking etiology into account for VS/UWS patients, a higher positive predictive value was assigned to traumatic patients, i.e., up to 92% (12/13) patients with higher level activation pattern achieved good recovery whereas 11 out of 13 (85%) non-traumatic patients with lower level activation or without activation had a negative clinical outcome. The reported data from visual analysis of fMRI activation patterns were corroborated using ROC curve analysis, which supported the correlation between auditory cortex activation volume and VS/UWS patients' recovery. The average brain activity overlap in primary and secondary auditory cortices in patients scanned twice was 52%. The activation type and volume in auditory cortex elicited by SON-FV significantly correlated with VS/UWS patients' prognosis, particularly in patients with traumatic etiology, however, this could not be established in MCS patients. Repeated use of this simple fMRI task might help obtain more reliable prognostic information. ",

A total of 34 patients with T2DM and 30 healthy controls were recruited for this study to receive a neuropsychological assessment and undergo resting-state FC. We selected four subregions of the cerebellum (bilateral lobules IX, right and left Crus I/II, and left lobule VI) as regions of interest (ROIs) to examine the differences in cerebellar-cerebral circuits in patients with T2DM compared to healthy controls. Correlation analysis was performed to examine the relationship between FC and clinical/cognitive variables in the patients. Compared to healthy controls, patients with T2DM showed significantly decreased cerebellar-cerebral FC in the default-mode network (DMN), executive control network (ECN), and visuospatial network (VSN).

Test foods were served from a Universal Eating Monitor (UEM) that measured eating rate and fMRI BOLD signals to the sight of food and non-food images were recorded. mCPP decreased rated appetite and intake of a palatable snack eaten in the absence of hunger but had no significant effect on the consumption of a pasta lunch (although pasta eating rate was reduced). mCPP also decreased BOLD fMRI responses to the sight of food pictures in areas of reward-associated circuitry. A post hoc analysis identified individual variability in the response to mCPP (exploratory responder-non-responder analysis). Some participants did not reduce their cookie intake after treatment with mCPP and this lack of response was associated with enhanced ratings of cookie pleasantness and enhanced baseline BOLD responses to food images in key reward and appetite circuitry.

pmid_22088655,Atypical frontal lobe activity during verbal working memory in youth with a family history of alcoholism.,,"Abnormal brain functioning during verbal working memory (VWM) tasks has been shown in individuals with alcohol use disorders (AUDs). Since adolescents with a familial history of alcoholism (FHP) are at high risk for developing an AUD, it is important to consider whether atypical brain activity during VWM may help to explain FHP vulnerability toward developing alcoholism. To that end, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined brain response during a VWM 2-back task in 19 FHP adolescents and 16 age and gender-matched family history negative (FHN) controls. Despite no group differences in task accuracy, FHP youth had significantly slower average reaction time when making correct responses during the 2-back condition than FHN youth. In contrast to a vigilance control condition, while covarying for reaction time, FHP adolescents showed less activation during VWM than FHN youth in multiple areas of the prefrontal cortex (PFC)--a brain region crucial to intact working memory skills. These results suggest that even prior to heavy alcohol use, FHP adolescents show atypical executive brain functioning during VWM, and that these differences are independent of slower working memory reaction time in FHP youth. Given the importance of working memory in numerous areas of day-to-day functioning, such as adaptive decision-making, these abnormalities may contribute to FHP youth vulnerability toward developing AUDs.

pmid_21209196,Choice from non-choice: predicting consumer preferences from blood oxygenation level-dependent signals obtained during passive viewing.,,"Decision-making is often viewed as a two-stage process, where subjective values are first assigned to each option and then the option of the highest value is selected. Converging evidence suggests that these subjective values are represented in the striatum and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). A separate line of evidence suggests that activation in the same areas represents the values of rewards even when choice is not required, as in classical conditioning tasks. However, it is unclear whether the same neural mechanism is engaged in both cases. To address this question we measured brain activation with functional magnetic resonance imaging while human subjects passively viewed individual consumer goods. We then sampled activation from predefined regions of interest and used it to predict subsequent choices between the same items made outside of the scanner. Our results show that activation in the striatum and MPFC in the absence of choice predicts subsequent choices, suggesting that these brain areas represent value in a similar manner whether or not choice is required.

pmid_24851846,Different cerebral responses to puncturing at ST36 among patients with functional dyspepsia and healthy subjects.,,"Little research has been done on the connection between functional status and acupuncture efficacy; however, functional status is a key factor in the study of acupuncture efficacy. Therefore, we have tried to compare functional dyspepsia (FD) patients with healthy subjects (HS) to determine the different cerebral responses elicited by acupuncture stimulation at Zusanli (ST36). IN this study, 24 FD patients and 24 HS were given acupuncture stimulation at ST36 while being monitored by an fMRI scan. Compared with HS, FD patients showed an fMRI signal decrease in the right anterior cingulate cortex, right medial prefrontal cortex, right orbitofrontal cortex, left superior occipital gyrus, and right cuneus; but on the other hand, there was an fMRI signal increase in the right insula, right postcentral gyrus, and right supramarginal gyrus. Acupuncture stimulation at ST36 evoked pronounced changes, especially in the homeostatic afferent processing network of FD patients, compared to HS. We hypothesize that the cerebral responses elicited by acupuncture stimulation in certain diseases, such as FD are correlated to specific regions. The action of stimulating acupoints might be dynamic; the functional status is therefore an essential impact factor for cerebral responses to acupuncture stimulation. ",

Behavioral and imaging data were collected from 19 IGD subjects (22.2 ± 3.08 years) and 21 healthy controls (HC, 22.8 ± 3.5 years). Behavior results showed that IGD subjects prefer the probabilistic options to fixed ones and were associated with shorter reaction time, when comparing to HC. The fMRI results revealed that IGD subjects show decreased activation in the inferior frontal gyrus and the precentral gyrus when choosing the probabilistic options than HC. Correlations were also calculated between behavioral performances and brain activities in relevant brain regions. Both of the behavioral performance and fMRI results indicate that people with IGD show impaired risk evaluation, which might be the reason why IGD subjects continue playing online games despite the risks of widely known negative consequence.

Alterations in functional connectivity during rest have been frequently reported in patients with schizophrenia. Though the default mode network (DN) appears to be abnormal in schizophrenia patients, little is known about its role in resistant AVH. We collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) data with a 3T scanner from 19 schizophrenia patients with chronic AVH resistant to pharmacological treatment, 14 schizophrenia patients without AVH and 20 healthy controls. Using seed-based correlation analysis, we created spherical seed regions of interest (ROI) to examine functional connectivity of the two DN hub regions (posterior cingulate cortex and anteromedial prefrontal cortex) and the two DN subsystems: dorsomedial prefrontal cortex subsystem and medial temporal lobe subsystem (p<0.0045 corrected). Patients with hallucinations exhibited higher FC between dMPFC ROI and bilateral central opercular cortex, bilateral insular cortex and bilateral precentral gyrus compared to non hallucinating patients and healthy controls. Additionally, patients with hallucinations also exhibited lower FC between vMPFC ROI and bilateral paracingulate and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. As the anterior cingulate cortex and the insula are two hubs of the salience network, our results suggest cross-network abnormalities between DN and salience system in patients with persistent hallucinations.

Recently, we developed Gazefinder, an all-in-one eye-tracking system for early detection of ASD in toddlers. Because abnormal gaze patterns have been documented in various ASD age groups, we predicted that Gazefinder might also detect gaze abnormality in adolescents and adults. In this study, we tested whether Gazefinder could identify unique gaze patterns in adolescents and adults with ASD. We measured the percentage of eye fixation time allocated to particular objects depicted in movies (i.e., eyes and mouth in human face movies, upright and inverted biological motion in movies that presented these stimuli simultaneously, and people and geometry in movies that presented these stimuli simultaneously) by male adolescents and adults with ASD (N = 26) and age-matched males with typical development (TD; N = 35). We compared these percentages between the two groups (ASD and TD) and with scores on the social responsiveness scale (SRS). Further, we conducted discriminant analyses to determine if fixation times allocated to particular objects could be used to discriminate between individuals with and without ASD. Compared with the TD group, the ASD group showed significantly less fixation time at locations of salient social information (i.e., eyes in the movie of human faces without lip movement and people in the movie of people and geometry), while there were no significant groupwise differences in the responses to movies of human faces with lip movement or biological motion. In a within-group correlation analysis, a few of the fixation-time items correlated with SRS, although most of them did not. No items significantly correlated with SRS in both ASD and TD groups. The percentage fixation times to eyes and people, which exhibited large effect sizes for the group difference, could differentiate ASD and TD with a sensitivity of 81.0% and a specificity of 80.0%. These findings suggest that Gazefinder is potentially a valuable and easy-to-use tool for objectively measuring unique gaze patterns and discriminating between ASD and TD in male adolescents and adults.

In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to explore the brain regions associated with judgements of relative recency in healthy humans. Bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's area [BA] 9) was more active during a verbal recency judgment task than during a non-mnemonic control task. Activation related to temporal context recognition was also observed in midline supplementary motor area (BA 6) and left precuneus (BA 7). This study provides further evidence that memory for temporal context requires the prefrontal cortex and is the first to demonstrate this association in healthy humans. The current findings also suggest the possibility that recognition of context and recognition of episodic content may involve similar brain systems. ",

Late effects of chemotherapy on brain function in this patient group are still unknown. In this study, we investigated differences between patients with and without chemotherapy in functional brain networks at rest and during an affective processing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task on average >14 years post-treatment. In addition, we report on changes in cognitive functioning during survivorship by comparing present and previous performance on a neuropsychological test battery on average 11 years earlier (3 years post-treatment). Twenty-eight chemotherapy (43.1 ± 7.5 years) and 23 surgery-only (48.2 ± 9.5 years) TC survivors were examined using neurocognitive tests and 3T-fMRI >10 years after treatment end. Brain functional networks were identified using dual regression independent component analysis. Task fMRI was analyzed using a block design. Standardized domain change scores were calculated for each individual to assess cognitive change. TC patients in the chemotherapy group showed functional hyperconnectivity at rest in the precuneus network, sensory and motor function network, executive control network, and the ventral stream network when compared with surgery-only patients. Furthermore, hypoactivation was found when performing the affective processing task. Cognitive data revealed that both groups showed comparable patterns of change from 3 to 14 years after initial treatment. This study provides novel insights on the possible underlying neurobiological mechanisms of late neurotoxic effects of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Present findings reveal that functional hyperconnectivity is widespread, possibly to compensate for the pathophysiological disturbances. This concurs with our previous findings of structural hyperconnectivity in white matter. Longitudinal multimodal imaging studies are warranted to further investigate the association between long-term structural and functional network connectivity data, as well as its relationship with cognitive changes.

The functional response of neural pathways to this stimulation in patients with VM was compared with age- and sex-matched patients with migraine without aura and healthy controls. Secondary analyses explored associations between BOLD signal change and clinical features of migraine in patients. We observed a robust cortical and subcortical pattern of BOLD signal change in response to ear irrigation across all participants. Patients with VM showed a significantly increased thalamic activation in comparison with both patients with migraine without aura and healthy controls. The magnitude of thalamic activation was positively correlated with the frequency of migraine attacks in patients with VM. We provide novel evidence for abnormal thalamic functional response to vestibular stimulation in patients with VM. These functional abnormalities in central vestibular processing may contribute to VM pathophysiology. ,

However, the extent to which these subsystems make differential contributions to disorder symptoms and to what degree such abnormalities occur in unaffected siblings have yet to be clarified. We used resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) to examine group differences in intra- and inter-connectivity of subsystems within the two neural networks, across a sample of patients with schizophrenia (n=24), their unaffected siblings (n=25), and healthy controls (n=22). We used group independent component analysis (gICA) to identify four network subsystems, including anterior and posterior portions of the DMN (aDMN, pDMN) as well as left- and right-lateralized portions of the FPN (lFPN, rFPN). Intra-connectivity is defined as neural coherence within a subsystem whereas inter-connectivity refers to functional connectivity between subsystems. In terms of intra-connectivity, patients and siblings shared dysconnection within the aDMN and two FPN subsystems, while both groups preserved connectivity within the pDMN. In terms of inter-connectivity, all groups exhibited positive connections between FPN and DMN subsystems, with patients having even stronger interaction between rFPN and aDMN than the controls, a feature that may underlie their psychotic symptoms. Our results implicate that DMN subsystems exhibit different liabilities to the disease risk while FPN subsystems demonstrate distinct inter-connectivity alterations. These dissociating manners between network subsystems explicitly suggest their differentiating roles to the disease susceptibility and manifestation. ",

Empathy

Social dilemma
fMRI","Decision-making in social dilemmas is suggested to rely on three factors: the valuation of a choice option, the relative judgment of two or more choice alternatives, and individual factors affecting the ease at which judgments and decisions are made. Here, we test whether empathy-an individual's relative ability to understand others' thoughts, emotions, and intentions-acts as an individual factor that alleviates conflict resolution in social decision-making. We test this by using a framed, iterated prisoners' dilemma (PD) game in two settings. In a behavioral experiment, we find that individual differences in empathic ability (the Empathy Quotient, EQ) were related to lower response times in the PD game, suggesting that empathy is related to faster social choices, independent of whether they choose to cooperate or defect. In a subsequent neuroimaging experiment, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we find that EQ is positively related to individual differences in the engagement of brain structures implemented in mentalizing, including the precuneus, superior temporal sulcus, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that empathy is related to the individual difference in the engagement of mentalizing in social dilemmas and that this is related to the efficiency of decision-making in social dilemmas.

pmid_17392317,The Enigmatic temporal pole: a review of findings on social and emotional processing.,,"The function of the anterior-most portion of the temporal lobes, the temporal pole, is not well understood. Anatomists have long considered it part of an extended limbic system based on its location posterior to the orbital frontal cortex and lateral to the amygdala, along with its tight connectivity to limbic and paralimbic regions. Here we review the literature in both non-human primates and humans to assess the temporal pole's putative role in social and emotional processing. Reviewed findings indicate that it has some role in both social and emotional processes, including face recognition and theory of mind, that goes beyond semantic memory. We propose that the temporal pole binds complex, highly processed perceptual inputs to visceral emotional responses. Because perceptual inputs remain segregated into dorsal (auditory), medial (olfactory) and ventral (visual) streams, the integration of emotion with perception is channel specific. ",
pmid_31137069,Altered Brain Regional Homogeneity in First-Degree Relatives of Type 2 Diabetics: A functional MRI Study.,,"This study aimed to investigate regional homogeneity in the first-: degree relatives of type 2 diabetes patients. Seventy-eight subjects, including 26 type 2 diabetes patients, 26 first-: degree relatives, and 26 healthy controls, were assessed. All participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning. The estimated regional homogeneity value was used to evaluate differences in brain activities. In first-: degree relatives, we observed significantly decreased regional homogeneity in the left anterior cingulate cortex, left insula, and bilateral temporal lobes, and increased regional homogeneity in the left superior frontal gyrus, right anterior cingulate cortex, and bilateral posterior cingulate cortex compared to healthy controls. In type 2 diabetes patients, we detected altered regional homogeneity in the left anterior cingulate cortex, left insula, bilateral posterior cingulate cortex, and several other brain regions compared to healthy controls. Both first-: degree relatives and type 2 diabetes patients showed decreased regional homogeneity in the left superior temporal gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, left anterior cingulate cortex, left insula, and increased regional homogeneity in the left superior frontal gyrus and bilateral posterior cingulate cortex. These findings suggest that altered regional homogeneity in the left anterior cingulate cortex, left insula, left superior frontal gyrus, bilateral posterior cingulate cortex, and bilateral temporal lobes might be a neuroimaging biomarker of type 2 diabetes -: related brain dysfunction.

fMRI","Compromised cognitive control in cannabis use-tempting situations is thought to play a key role in the development of cannabis use disorders. However, little is known about how exposure to cannabis cues and contexts may influence cognitive control and the underlying neural mechanisms in cannabis users. Working memory (WM) is an attention reliant executive function central to cognitive control. In this study, we investigated how distracting cannabis words affected WM load-dependent performance and related brain activity in near-daily cannabis users (N = 36) relative to controls (N = 33). Brain activity was recorded during a novel N-back flanker WM task with neutral and cannabis flankers added as task-irrelevant distractors. On a behavioural level, WM performance did not differ between groups, and the presence of cannabis flankers did not affect performance. However, in cannabis users compared to controls, the presence of cannabis flankers reduced WM load-related activity in multiple regions, including the insula, thalamus, superior parietal lobe and supramarginal gyrus. The group specificity of these effects suggest that cannabis users might differ from controls in the way they process cannabis-related cues and that cannabis cue exposure could interfere with other cognitive processes under cognitively demanding circumstances. Future studies should focus on the role of context in cognitive control-related processes like WM and attention to further elucidate potential cognitive impairments in heavy cannabis users and how these relate to loss of control over drug seeking itself.

Social cognition
Theory of Mind","Theory of Mind (ToM) is thought to play a key role in social information processing as it refers to the ability of individuals to represent the mental states of others (e.g., intentions, desires, beliefs). A provocative hypothesis has been put forward which espouses the existence of two ToM systems: one that is implicit and involves the automatic analysis of the belief states of others and another that is not automatic and is involved in explicitly reasoning about others' mental states. Recently, Phillips et al. (2015) have suggested that there is limited evidence for automatic ToM processing, after identifying a confound in a previous high-profile paper supporting the existence of this cognitive operation in infants and adults (Kovács, Téglás, & Endress, 2010). Here, we take a broader view of the literature and find, contrary to the conclusions of Phillips et al., that there is a substantial body of literature which demonstrates that adult humans are able to engage in unconscious and unintentional, and thus automatic, analyses of others' mental states. However, whether this ability is best described under a one, two or multiple systems ToM account remains to be determined. ",
pmid_18501969,An improved approach to detection of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) for resting-state fMRI: fractional ALFF.,,"Most of the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies demonstrated the correlations between spatially distinct brain areas from the perspective of functional connectivity or functional integration. The functional connectivity approaches do not directly provide information of the amplitude of brain activity of each brain region within a network. Alternatively, an index named amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of the resting-state fMRI signal has been suggested to reflect the intensity of regional spontaneous brain activity. However, it has been indicated that the ALFF is also sensitive to the physiological noise. The current study proposed a fractional ALFF (fALFF) approach, i.e., the ratio of power spectrum of low-frequency (0.01-0.08 Hz) to that of the entire frequency range and this approach was tested in two groups of resting-state fMRI data. The results showed that the brain areas within the default mode network including posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, medial prefrontal cortex and bilateral inferior parietal lobule had significantly higher fALFF than the other brain areas. This pattern was consistent with previous neuroimaging results. The non-specific signal components in the cistern areas in resting-state fMRI were significantly suppressed, indicating that the fALFF approach improved the sensitivity and specificity in detecting spontaneous brain activities. Its mechanism and sensitivity to abnormal brain activity should be evaluated in the future studies. ",

This study aims at developing an unsupervised machine learning approach for the accurate identification of major depression based on single resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans in the absence of clinical information. Twenty-four medication-naive patients with major depression and 29 demographically similar healthy individuals underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We first clustered the voxels within the perigenual cingulate cortex into two subregions, a subgenual region and a pregenual region, according to their distinct resting-state functional connectivity patterns and showed that a maximum margin clustering-based unsupervised machine learning approach extracted sufficient information from the subgenual cingulate functional connectivity map to differentiate depressed patients from healthy controls with a group-level clustering consistency of 92.5% and an individual-level classification consistency of 92.5%. It was also revealed that the subgenual cingulate functional connectivity network with the highest discriminative power primarily included the ventrolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, superior temporal gyri and limbic areas, indicating that these connections may play critical roles in the pathophysiology of major depression. The current study suggests that subgenual cingulate functional connectivity network signatures may provide promising objective biomarkers for the diagnosis of major depression and that maximum margin clustering-based unsupervised machine learning approaches may have the potential to inform clinical practice and aid in research on psychiatric disorders.

pmid_29660044,Multimodal Neuroimaging Differences in Nicotine Abstinent Smokers Versus Satiated Smokers.,,"Research on cigarette smokers suggests cognitive and behavioral impairments. However, much remains unclear how the functional neurobiology of smokers is influenced by nicotine state. Therefore, we sought to determine which state, be it acute nicotine abstinence or satiety, would yield the most robust differences compared with nonsmokers when assessing neurobiological markers of nicotine dependence. Smokers (N = 15) and sociodemographically matched nonsmokers (N = 15) were scanned twice using a repeated-measures design. Smokers were scanned after a 24-hour nicotine abstinence and immediately after smoking their usual brand cigarette. The neuroimaging battery included a stop-signal task of response inhibition and pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF). Whole-brain voxel-wise analyses of covariance were carried out on stop success and stop fail Stop-Signal Task contrasts and CBF maps to assess differences among nonsmokers, abstinent smokers, and satiated smokers. Cluster correction was performed using AFNI's 3dClustSim to achieve a significance of p < .05. Smokers exhibited higher brain activation in bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, a brain region known to be involved in inhibitory control, during successful response inhibitions relative to nonsmokers. This effect was significantly higher during nicotine abstinence relative to satiety. Smokers also exhibited lower CBF in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus than nonsmokers. These hypoperfusions were not different between abstinence and satiety. These findings converge on alterations in smokers in prefrontal circuits known to be critical for inhibitory control. These effects are present, even when smokers are satiated, but the neural activity required to achieve performance equal to controls is increased when smokers are in acute abstinence. Our multimodal neuroimaging study gives neurobiological insights into the cognitive demands of maintaining abstinence and suggests targets for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. ",

task set","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons, resulting in progressive weakness and muscle atrophy. Recent studies suggest that nondemented ALS patients can show selective cognitive impairments, predominantly executive dysfunction, but little is known about the neural basis of these impairments. Oculomotor studies in ALS have described deficits in antisaccade execution, which requires the implementation of a task set that includes inhibition of automatic responses followed by generation of a voluntary action. It has been suggested that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) contributes in this process. Thus, we investigated whether deterioration of executive functions in ALS patients, such as the ability to implement flexible behavior during the antisaccade task, is related to DLPFC dysfunction. While undergoing an fMRI scan, 12 ALS patients and 12 age-matched controls performed an antisaccade task with concurrent eye tracking. We hypothesized that DLPFC deficits would appear during the antisaccade preparation stage, when the task set is being established. ALS patients made more antisaccade direction errors and showed significant reductions in DLPFC activation. In contrast, regions, such as supplementary eye fields and frontal eye fields, showed increased activation that was anticorrelated with the number of errors. The ALS group also showed reduced saccadic latencies that correlated with increased activation across the oculomotor saccade system. These findings suggest that ALS results in deficits in the inhibition of automatic responses that are related to impaired DLPFC activation. However, they also suggest that ALS patients undergo functional changes that partially compensate the neurological impairment. ",
pmid_15866151,The cognitive control of emotion.,,"The capacity to control emotion is important for human adaptation. Questions about the neural bases of emotion regulation have recently taken on new importance, as functional imaging studies in humans have permitted direct investigation of control strategies that draw upon higher cognitive processes difficult to study in nonhumans. Such studies have examined (1) controlling attention to, and (2) cognitively changing the meaning of, emotionally evocative stimuli. These two forms of emotion regulation depend upon interactions between prefrontal and cingulate control systems and cortical and subcortical emotion-generative systems. Taken together, the results suggest a functional architecture for the cognitive control of emotion that dovetails with findings from other human and nonhuman research on emotion. ",
pmid_23732942,Anatomical and functional brain abnormalities in drug-naive first-episode schizophrenia.,,"The authors sought to explore whether anatomical and functional brain deficits are present in similar or different brain regions early in the course of schizophrenia, before antipsychotic treatment, and whether these deficits are more severe or otherwise different in patients with prominent negative symptoms. A total of 100 drug-naive first-episode schizophrenia patients and 100 matched healthy comparison subjects underwent structural and resting-state functional MRI scanning. Gray matter volume and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations during resting-state functional studies were measured. Group comparisons of gray matter volume showed significant differences mainly in thalamo-cortical networks, while alterations in the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations were observed in fronto-parietal and default mode networks. Thus, different brain regions had alterations in gray matter volume and resting state physiology. These changes did not correlate with the duration of untreated illness, nor with acute clinical symptom severity. Patients with prominent negative symptoms had greater regional alterations in brain anatomy, particularly in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, while the pattern of functional alterations was unrelated to severity of negative symptoms. Anatomical and resting-state functional deficits were observed in different brain regions, indicating that anatomical and functional brain abnormalities are significantly dissociated in the early course of schizophrenia. The lack of association of these abnormalities with illness duration and episode severity suggests that these anatomical and functional changes may be early-evolving features of the illness that are relatively stable early in the course of illness. The different structural deficits of regional gray matter observed in patients with prominent negative symptoms may provide unique insight into the early regional neuropathology of this symptom dimension in schizophrenia.

After a mean follow-up of 2.8 ± 1.9 years, 7 MCI patients converted to AD, while 14 patients remained cognitively stable. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA), followed by a ""dual-regression"" technique to create and compare subject-specific maps of each independent spatiotemporal component, correcting for age, sex, and gray matter atrophy. AD patients displayed lower FC within the default-mode network (DMN) in the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex compared with controls, independent of cortical atrophy. Regional FC values of MCI patients were numerically in between AD patients and controls, but only the difference between AD and stable MCI patients was statistically significant. Correlation with cognitive dysfunction demonstrated the clinical relevance of FC changes within the DMN. In conclusion, clinically relevant decreased FC within the DMN was observed in AD. ",

Our explicit hope in writing our book in 1995 was to provide a theoretical framework that would stimulate research in the field. Conversely, well-designed empirical contributions conceived within the framework of the model are the only way for us to progress along the route towards a fully fleshed-out specification of its workings.

fMRI","Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure results in a range of deficits, including both volumetric and functional changes in brain regions involved in response inhibition such as the prefrontal cortex and striatum. The current study examined blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response during a stop signal task in adolescents (ages 13-16 y) with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (AE, n=21) and controls (CON, n=21). Task performance was measured using percent correct inhibits during three difficulty conditions: easy, medium, and hard. Group differences in BOLD response relative to baseline motor responding were examined across all inhibition trials and for each difficulty condition separately. The contrast between hard and easy trials was analyzed to determine whether increasing task difficulty affected BOLD response. Groups had similar task performance and demographic characteristics, except for full scale IQ scores (AE<CON). The AE group demonstrated greater BOLD response in frontal, sensorimotor, striatal, and cingulate regions relative to controls, especially as task difficulty increased. When contrasting hard vs. easy inhibition trials, the AE group showed greater medial/superior frontal and cuneus BOLD response than controls. Results were unchanged after demographics and FAS diagnosis were statistically controlled. This was the first fMRI study to utilize a stop signal task, isolating fronto-striatal functioning, to assess response inhibition and the effects task difficulty in adolescents with prenatal alcohol exposure. Results suggest that heavy prenatal alcohol exposure disrupts neural function of this circuitry, resulting in immature cognitive processing and motor-association learning and neural compensation during response inhibition.

However, few works have attempted to reveal the relationships between tai chi, executive control, and emotion regulation in the same study. The current resting-state study investigated whether the impact of tai chi on elders' emotion regulation was mediated by the resting-state functional connectivity within the executive control network. A total of 26 elders with long-term tai chi experience and 26 demographically matched healthy elders were recruited. After the resting-state scan, both groups were required to complete a series of questionnaires, including the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), and a sequential decision task, which offered an index of the subjects' emotion-regulation ability by calculating how their emotional response could be affected by the objective outcomes of their decisions. Compared to the control group, the tai chi group showed higher levels of non-judgment of inner experiences (a component of the FFMQ), stronger emotion-regulation ability, and a weaker resting-state functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the middle frontal gyrus (MFG). Moreover, the functional connectivity between the DLPFC and the MFG in the tai chi group fully mediated the impact of non-judgment of inner experience on their emotion-regulation ability. These findings highlighted that the modulation of non-judgment of inner experience on long-term tai chi practitioners' emotion regulation was achieved through decreased functional connectivity within the executive control network.

pmid_16047521,Examining personality and alcohol expectancies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with adolescents.,,"Personality and alcohol expectancies have been examined as risk factors for the initiation and maintenance of alcohol use in adolescents and young adults. Differences in processing appetitive stimuli are seen as a mechanism for personality's influence on behavior, and that mechanism predisposes individuals to form more positive expectancies for alcohol. The go/no-go task has been used to show how personality differences influence responding to appetitive stimuli in adolescents and adults, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to examine the relation of go/no-go responding to personality in adult males. However, no study to date has examined the relation between fMRI responding, personality and alcohol expectancies in adolescents. Forty-six adolescents (ages 12-14 years; 61% male) with minimal substance use histories completed measures of neuroticism, extraversion, and alcohol expectancies, and performed a go/no-go task during fMRI acquisition. Greater blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response to inhibition predicted fewer expectancies of cognitive and motor improvements but more expectancies of cognitive and motor impairment from alcohol. In addition, extraverted youths reported more positive alcohol expectancies. However, BOLD response did not predict neuroticism or extraversion. These preliminary results suggest that decreased inhibitory neural processing may contribute to more positive and less negative expectancies, which can eventually lead to problem drinking. Further, extraversion may also yield more positive expectancies and could underlie a vulnerability to disordered alcohol use. ",
pmid_19058792,Coping with emotions past: the neural bases of regulating affect associated with negative autobiographical memories.,,"Although the ability to adaptively reflect on negative autobiographical experiences without ruminating is critical to mental health, to our knowledge no research has directly examined the neural systems underlying this process. Sixteen participants were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as they focused on negative autobiographical memories using cognitive strategies designed to facilitate (feel strategy) versus undermine (analyze and accept strategies) rumination. Two key findings were obtained. First, consistent with prior emotion regulation research using image-based stimuli, left prefrontal activity was observed during the implementation of all three strategies. Second, activity in a network of regions involved in self-referential processing and emotion, including subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex, was highest in response to the feel strategy and lowest for the accept strategy. This pattern of activation mirrored participants' self-reports of negative affect when engaging in each strategy. These findings shed light on the brain regions that distinguish adaptive versus maladaptive forms of reflecting on negative autobiographical memories and offer a novel, ecologically valid route to exploring the neural bases of emotion regulation using fMRI.

pmid_17595018,A functional MRI study of amygdala responses to angry schematic faces in social anxiety disorder.,,"Neuroimaging studies using angry or contemptuous human facial photographic stimuli have suggested amygdala hyper-responsivity in social anxiety disorder (SAD). We sought to determine if an angry ""schematic face"" (simple line drawing) would evoke exaggerated amygdalar responses in SAD patients compared with healthy control (HC) subjects. Angry, happy, and neutral schematic faces were overtly presented to matched cohorts of 11 SAD and 11 HC subjects for passive viewing, whereas brain functional magnetic resonance imaging signal was measured at 1.5 Tesla. Voxel-wise analyses were performed using a random effects model in SPM99. Compared with HC subjects, SAD patients exhibited exaggerated responses in the right amygdala for the Angry versus Neutral contrast. The findings of exaggerated amygdala responses to angry schematic faces in SAD converge with results from earlier neuroimaging studies and illustrate the potential utility of schematic faces for probing amygdala function in psychiatric disorders. One prospective advantage of schematic faces is that they may minimize confounds related to gender, age, or race effects. However, extending earlier findings in healthy subjects, schematic faces appear more effective for probing amygdala responses to arousal-based (Angry versus Neutral) as opposed to valence-based (Angry versus Happy) contrasts.

pmid_26058049,Selective Functional Disconnection of the Dorsal Subregion of the Temporal Pole in Schizophrenia.,,"Although extensive resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) changes have been reported in schizophrenia, rsFC changes in the temporal pole (TP) remain unknown. The TP contains several subregions with different connection patterns; however, it is not known whether TP subregions are differentially affected in schizophrenia. Sixty-six schizophrenia patients and 76 healthy comparison subjects underwent resting-state fMRI using a sensitivity-encoded spiral-in (SENSE-SPIRAL) imaging sequence to reduce susceptibility-induced signal loss and distortion. The TP was subdivided into the dorsal (TPd) and ventral (TPv) subregions. Mean fMRI time series were extracted for each TP subregion and entered into a seed-based rsFC analysis. Direct between-group comparisons revealed reduced rsFC between the right TPd and brain regions involved in language processing and multisensory integration in schizophrenia, including the left superior temporal gyrus, left mid-cingulate cortex, and right insular cortex. The rsFC changes of the right TPd in schizophrenia were independent of the grey matter reduction of this subregion. Moreover, these rsFC changes were unrelated to illness severity, duration of illness and antipsychotic medication dosage. No significant group differences were observed in the rsFC of the left TPd and bilateral TPv subregions. These findings suggest a selective (the right TPd) functional disconnection of TP subregions in schizophrenia. ",

fMRI","The efficacy of cognitive training is controversial, and research progress in the field requires an understanding of factors that promote transfer of training gains and their relationship to changes in brain activity. One such factor may be adaptive task difficulty, as adaptivity is predicted to facilitate more efficient processing by creating a prolonged mismatch between the supply of, and the demand upon, neural resources. To test this hypothesis, we measured behavioral and neural plasticity in fMRI sessions before and after 10 sessions of working memory updating (WMU) training, in which the difficulty of practiced tasks either adaptively increased in response to performance or was fixed. Adaptive training resulted in transfer to an untrained episodic memory task and activation decreases in striatum and hippocampus on a trained WMU task, and the amount of training task improvement was associated with near transfer to other WMU tasks and with hippocampal activation changes on both near and far transfer tasks. These findings suggest that cognitive training programs should incorporate adaptive task difficulty to broaden transfer of training gains and maximize efficiency of task-related brain activity. ",

We recruited 20 patients with ESRD on regular hemodialysis and 17 healthy controls (HCs). All of the participants underwent resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), neuropsychological tests, and blood biochemical examination. The individual ALFF values between the two groups were tested by an independent sample  The ALFF values of the right precuneus and angular gyrus (RAG) in the ESRD group were lower than those in the HC subjects, but the right precentral gyrus showed higher ALFF values in patients. Hemoglobin (Hb) was negatively correlated with the ALFF values of the right precentral gyrus, and the ALFF values of the right precuneus were negatively correlated with line-tracing test (LTT) scores in patients with ESRD. Patients with ESRD show decreased connectivity between the RAG and the left precuneus, right superior frontal gyrus (RSFG), and the connectivity within the RAG was weak. In addition, FC in the RAG-right cuneus, right precuneus-left supramarginal gyrus was enhanced in the patient group. Our research suggested that, in hemodialysis patients with ESRD, the brain areas with abnormal spontaneous brain activity and FC are mainly located in the default mode network (DMN) regions. Hb and the LTT results were correlated with abnormal spontaneous brain activity. These findings provide additional evidence to understand the possible underlying neuropathological mechanisms in patients with ESRD. ",

Ten participants were shown lyrics of familiar verbal tunes; they either heard the tune along with the lyrics, or they had to imagine it. In a subsequent surprise recognition test, they had to identify the titles of tunes that they had heard or imagined earlier. The functional data showed substantial overlap during melody perception and imagery, including secondary auditory areas. During imagery compared with perception, an extended network including pFC, SMA, intraparietal sulcus, and cerebellum showed increased activity, in line with the increased processing demands of imagery. Functional connectivity of anterior right temporal cortex with frontal areas was increased during imagery compared with perception, indicating that these areas form an imagery-related network. Activity in right superior temporal gyrus and pFC was correlated with the subjective rating of imagery vividness. Similar to the encoding phase, the recognition task recruited overlapping areas, including inferior frontal cortex associated with memory retrieval, as well as left middle temporal gyrus. The results present new evidence for the cortical network underlying goal-directed auditory imagery, with a prominent role of the right pFC both for the subjective impression of imagery vividness and for on-line mental monitoring of imagery-related activity in auditory areas.

Despite this progress, a considerable heterogeneity of structural findings persists that may reflect the phenomenological diversity of schizophrenia. It is unclear whether the range of possible clinical disease manifestations relates to a core structural brain deficit or to distinct structural correlates. Therefore, gray matter density (GMD) differences between 175 schizophrenic patients (SZ) and 177 matched healthy control subjects (HC) were examined in a three-step approach using cross-sectional and conjunctional voxel-based morphometry (VBM): (1) analysis of structural alterations irrespective of symptomatology; (2) subdivision of the patient sample according to a three-dimensional factor model of the PANSS and investigation of structural differences between these subsamples and healthy controls; (3) analysis of a common pattern of structural alterations present in all patient subsamples compared to healthy controls. Significant GMD reductions in patients compared to controls were identified within the prefrontal, limbic, paralimbic, temporal and thalamic regions. The disorganized symptom dimension was associated with bilateral alterations in temporal, insular and medial prefrontal cortices. Positive symptoms were associated with left-pronounced alterations in perisylvian regions and extended thalamic GMD losses. Negative symptoms were linked to the most extended alterations within orbitofrontal, medial prefrontal, lateral prefrontal and temporal cortices as well as limbic and subcortical structures. Thus, structural heterogeneity in schizophrenia may relate to specific patterns of GMD reductions that possibly share a common prefrontal-perisylvian pattern of structural brain alterations. ",

The aim of this study was to investigate patients exhibiting severely disturbed consciousness using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Five cases of posttraumatic vegetative state and one with minimal consciousness close to the vegetative state were studied clinically, electrophysiologically, and by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging. Visual, sensory, and acoustic paradigms were used for stimulation. In three patients examined less than 2 months after trauma, a consistent decrease in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal ('negative activation') was observed for visual stimulation; one case even showed a decrease in BOLD activation for all three activation paradigms. In the remaining three cases examined more than 6 months after trauma, visual stimulation yielded positive BOLD contrast or no activation. In all cases, sensory stimulation was followed by a decrease in BOLD signal or no activation, whereas auditory stimulation failed to elicit any activation with the exception of one case. Functional magnetic resonance imaging in the vegetative state indicates retained yet abnormal brain function; this abnormality can be attributed to the impairment of cerebral vascular autoregulation or an increase in the energy consumption of activated neocortex in severe traumatic brain injury.

pmid_16027012,Anterior prefrontal involvement in episodic retrieval reflects contextual interference.,,"Different patterns of prefrontal activation are commonly found in studies of episodic and source memory (typically anterior and lateral) compared to those found in studies of autobiographical memory (typically ventromedial). We investigated a proposal that the former pattern reflects contextual interference when retrieving events that occurred in similar contexts. We used virtual reality to simulate contextually varied life-like events, in which subjects received distinct objects from a number of people in a number of locations. We compared fMRI data from two experiments in which the number of events per context varied. The first experiment (Burgess, N., Maguire, E.A., Spiers, H.J., and O'Keefe, J. 2001. A temporoparietal and prefrontal network for retrieving the spatial context of lifelike events. Neuroimage 14, 439-453) involved 16 objects received from one of two people in one of two locations. The second experiment involved 20 objects, each received from a different person in a different location. The first experiment showed extensive bilateral activation of anterior and lateral prefrontal cortex, as well as a medial temporal and parietal network characteristic of both autobiographical and episodic memory. In the second study, the prefrontal activations were largely absent, while the medial parietal and temporal activations remained, and a ventromedial prefrontal area was additionally activated. Direct comparisons revealed large areas of significantly reduced activation in BA10, with lesser reductions in lateral prefrontal regions. We suggest that involvement of these prefrontal regains in episodic and source memory reflects the use of paradigms involving many events and few sources rather than any fundamental processing requirement of contextual retrieval in the absence of interference.

schizophrenia","In schizophrenia, consistent structural and functional changes have been demonstrated for the insula including aberrant salience processing, which is critical for psychosis. Interactions within and across default mode and central executive network (DMN, CEN) are impaired in schizophrenia. The question arises whether these 2 types of changes are related. Recently, the anterior insula has been demonstrated to control DMN/CEN interactions. We hypothesized that aberrant insula and DMN/CEN activity in schizophrenia is associated with an impaired dependence of DMN/CEN interactions on anterior insular salience network (SN) activity. Eighteen patients with schizophrenia during psychosis and 20 healthy controls were studied by resting-state-fMRI and psychometric examination. High-model-order independent component analysis of fMRI data revealed spatiotemporal patterns of synchronized ongoing blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) activity including SN, DMN, and CEN. Scores of functional and time-lagged connectivity across networks' time courses were calculated. Connectivity scores and spatial network maps were compared between groups and related with patients' hallucination and delusion severity. Spatial BOLD-synchronicity was altered in patients' SN, DMN, and CEN, including decreased activity in the right anterior insula (rAI). Patients' functional connectivity between DMN and CEN was increased and related with hallucinations severity. Importantly, patients' time-lagged connectivity between SN and DMN/CEN was reduced, and decreased rAI activity of the SN was associated with both hallucinations and increased functional connectivity between DMN and CEN. Data provide evidence for an aberrant dependence of DMN/CEN interactions on anterior insular SN activity, linking impaired insula, DMN, CEN activity, and psychosis in schizophrenia. ",
pmid_17497646,Cross-cultural music phrase processing: an fMRI study.,,"The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural basis of musical phrase boundary processing during the perception of music from native and non-native cultures. German musicians performed a cultural categorization task while listening to phrased Western (native) and Chinese (non-native) musical excerpts as well as modified versions of these, where the impression of phrasing has been reduced by removing the phrase boundary marking pause (henceforth called ""unphrased""). Bilateral planum temporale was found to be associated with an increased difficulty of identifying phrase boundaries in unphrased Western melodies. A network involving frontal and parietal regions showed increased activation for the phrased condition with the orbital part of left inferior frontal gyrus presumably reflecting working memory aspects of the temporal integration between phrases, and the middle frontal gyrus and intraparietal sulcus probably reflecting attention processes. Areas more active in the culturally familiar, native (Western) condition included, in addition to the left planum temporale and right ventro-medial prefrontal cortex, mainly the bilateral motor regions. These latter results are interpreted in light of sensorimotor integration. Regions with increased signal for the unfamiliar, non-native music style (Chinese) included a right lateralized network of angular gyrus and the middle frontal gyrus, possibly reflecting higher demands on attention systems, and the right posterior insula suggesting higher loads on basic auditory processing.

Schizophrenia","In the present study, we used Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analysis to quantitatively examine brain grey matter reduction in schizophrenia patients with persistent negative symptoms (PNS). A total of 12 voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies were included in ALE meta-analysis using more stringent criterion of PNS. Significant grey matter reduction in the PNS group relative to controls was observed in the left caudate nucleus, the left precentral region, the left middle frontal region, the bilateral parahippocampal region, the left anterior cingulate region, the bilateral medial frontal gyrus, the thalamus and the insula. Our results suggest that brain regions in the reward network may be specifically related to PNS, especially the left caudate nucleus. It is possible that abnormality in reward processing may constitute the neural basis of PNS. ",
pmid_23562770,Increased neural responses to unfairness in a loss context.,,"Unfairness plays an important role in economic decision making. This fMRI study sought to investigate how the loss and the gain contexts could modulate behavioral and brain responses to unfairness by focusing on participants' rejection behaviors during an Ultimatum Game paradigm. Participants were scanned while they were playing the Ultimatum Game as responders in both loss and gain contexts, i.e. receiving ¥50 as gains and paying for ¥50 as losses. At the behavioral level, lower fairness ratings and higher rejection rates were revealed for unfair losses than unfair gains. At the neural level, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex/anterior middle cingulate cortex and bilateral dorsal striatum were associated with rejection (vs. acceptance) in the loss context, but not in the gain context. Together, our data indicated that participants may experience more unfairness in UG and stronger desire to sanction social norm violations in the loss context than in the gain context, inducing more fairness-related neutral activities when rejecting (vs. accepting) unfair losses than unfair gains. These findings shed light on the significance of context (i.e. loss or gain) in fairness-related social decision-making processes. ",

reappraisal","Cognitive reappraisal is a form of emotion regulation that alters emotional responding by changing the meaning of emotional stimuli. Reappraisal engages regions of the prefrontal cortex that support multiple functions, including visceral control functions implicated in regulating the immune system. Immune activity plays a role in the preclinical pathophysiology of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), an inflammatory condition that is highly comorbid with affective disorders characterized by problems with emotion regulation. Here, we tested whether prefrontal engagement by reappraisal would be associated with atherosclerotic CVD risk and whether this association would be mediated by inflammatory activity. Community volunteers (n = 157; 30-54 years of age; 80 women) without DSM-IV Axis-1 psychiatric diagnoses or cardiovascular or immune disorders performed a functional neuroimaging task involving the reappraisal of negative emotional stimuli. Carotid artery intima-media thickness and inter-adventitial diameter were measured by ultrasonography and used as markers of preclinical atherosclerosis. Also measured were circulating levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), an inflammatory cytokine linked to CVD risk and prefrontal neural activity. Greater reappraisal-related engagement of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex was associated with greater preclinical atherosclerosis and IL-6. Moreover, IL-6 mediated the association of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex engagement with preclinical atherosclerosis. These results were independent of age, sex, race, smoking status, and other known CVD risk factors. The cognitive regulation of emotion might relate to CVD risk through a pathway involving the functional interplay between the anterior cingulate region of the prefrontal cortex and inflammatory activity.

pmid_32066671,ADHD and ASD: distinct brain patterns of inhibition-related activation?,,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD) and autism spectrum (ASD) disorders often co-occur. In both cases, response inhibition deficits and inhibition-related atypical brain activation have been reported, although less consistently in ASD. Research exploring the overlap/distinctiveness between ADHD and ASD has significantly increased in recent years, but direct comparison of the inhibition-related neuronal correlates between these disorders are scarce in the literature. This study aimed at disentangling the shared and specific inhibitory brain dysfunctions in ASD and ADHD. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), brain activity was compared between children with ADHD, ASD and typically developing (TD) children aged 8-12 years during an inhibition stop-signal task, using stringent inclusion criteria. At the behavioural level, only children with ADHD exhibited inhibition deficits when compared with the TD group. Distinct patterns of brain activity were observed during successful inhibition. In children with ADHD, motor inhibition was associated with right inferior parietal activation, whereas right frontal regions were activated in children with ASD. Between-group comparisons disclosed higher middle frontal activation in the ASD group compared with the ADHD and the TD groups. Our results evidence different patterns of activation during inhibition in these two disorders, recruiting different regions of the fronto-parietal network associated to inhibition. Besides brain activity differences, behavioural inhibition deficits found only in children with ADHD further suggest that reactive inhibition is one of the core deficits in ADHD, but not in ASD. Our findings provide further evidence contributing to disentangle the shared and specific inhibitory dysfunctions in ASD and ADHD. ",

ventral striatum","The relationship between transdiagnostic, dimensional, and categorical approaches to psychiatric nosology is under intense debate. To inform this discussion, we studied neural systems linked to reward anticipation across a range of disorders and behavioral dimensions. We assessed brain responses to reward expectancy in a large sample of 221 participants, including patients with schizophrenia (SZ; n = 27), bipolar disorder (BP; n = 28), major depressive disorder (MD; n = 31), autism spectrum disorder (ASD; n = 25), and healthy controls (n = 110). We also characterized all subjects with an extensive test battery from which a cognitive, affective, and social functioning factor was constructed. These factors were subsequently related to functional responses in the ventral striatum (vST) and neural networks linked to it. We found that blunted vST responses were present in SZ, BP, and ASD but not in MD. Activation within the vST predicted individual differences in affective, cognitive, and social functioning across diagnostic boundaries. Network alterations extended beyond the reward network to include regions implicated in executive control. We further confirmed the robustness of our results in various control analyses. Our findings suggest that altered brain responses during reward anticipation show transdiagnostic alterations that can be mapped onto dimensional measures of functioning. They also highlight the role of executive control of reward and salience signaling in the disorders we study and show the power of systems-level neuroscience to account for clinically relevant behaviors.

resting-state","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of motor neurons that leads to paralysis and eventually death. There is evidence that atrophy occurs in the primary motor cortex (M1), but it is unclear how the disease affects the intrinsic connectivity of this structure. Thus, the goal of this study was to examine interhemispheric coupling of low frequency blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations in M1 using functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging during rest. Because disease progression is rapid, high-functioning patients were recruited to assess neural changes in the relatively early stages of ALS. Twenty patients with limb-onset ALS participated in this study. A parceling technique was employed to segment both precentral gyri into multiple regions of interest (ROI), thus increasing sensitivity to detect changes that exist along discretely localized regions of the motor cortex. We report an overall systemic decrease in functional connectivity between right and left motor cortices in patients with limb-onset ALS. Additionally, we observed a pronounced disconnection between dorsal ROI pairs in the ALS group compared to the healthy control group. Furthermore, measures of limb functioning correlated with the connectivity data from dorsal ROI pairs in the ALS group, suggesting a symptomatic relationship with interhemispheric M1 connectivity.

pmid_19387979,No gender differences in brain activation during the N-back task: an fMRI study in healthy individuals.,,"Gender differences have been well established in verbal and spatial abilities but few studies have examined if these differences also extend into the domain of working memory in terms of behavioural differences and brain activation. The conclusions that can be drawn from these studies are not clear cut but suggest that even though gender differences might not be apparent from behavioural measures, the underlying neural substrate associated with working memory might be different in men and women. Previous research suggests activation in a network of frontal and parietal regions during working memory tasks. This study aimed to investigate gender differences in patterns of brain activation during a verbal version of the N-back working memory task, which incorporates the effects of increased demands on working memory. A total of 50 healthy subjects, aged 18 to 58 years, that were equally split by gender were recruited matched for age, levels of education and ethnicity. All subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found that men and women performed equally well in terms of accuracy and response times, while using similar brain regions to the same degree. Our observations indicate that verbal working memory is not affected by gender at the behavioural or neural level, and support the findings of a recent meta-analysis by Hyde ([ 2005]: Sex Roles 53:717-725) that gender differences are generally smaller than intra-gender differences in many cognitive domains.

The major subregions of the human amygdala have been anatomically delineated, but the individual contribution of these subregions to facial emotion perception is unclear. Here we combined functional MRI (fMRI) with cytoarchitectonically defined maximum probabilistic maps to investigate the response characteristics of amygdala subregions in 14 subjects presented with dynamic animations of angry and happy relative to neutral facial expressions. We localized facial emotion-related signal changes in the basolateral and superficial (cortical) subregions of the left amygdala, with most robust responses observed to happy faces. Moreover, we demonstrate a differential neural response to happy faces in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which is consistent with a hypothesized role of this brain region in positive valence processing. Furthermore, angry and happy faces both evoked temporopolar responses. Our findings extend current models of facial emotion perception in humans by suggesting an intrinsic functional differentiation within the amygdala related to the extraction of value from facial expressions. ",
pmid_17596416,Frontoparietal activation with preparation for antisaccades.,,"Several current models hold that frontoparietal areas exert cognitive control by biasing task-relevant processing in other brain areas. Previous event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have compared prosaccades and antisaccades, which require subjects to look toward or away from a flashed peripheral stimulus, respectively. These studies found greater activation for antisaccades in frontal and parietal regions at the ends of long (>or=6 s) preparatory periods preceding peripheral stimulus presentation. Event-related fMRI studies using short preparatory periods (<or=4 s) have not found such activation differences except in the frontal eye field. Here, we identified activation differences associated with short (1-s) preparatory periods by interleaving half trials among regular whole trials in a rapid fMRI design. On whole trials, a colored fixation dot instructed human subjects to make either a prosaccade toward or an antisaccade away from a peripheral visual stimulus. Half trials included only the instruction and not peripheral stimulus presentation or saccade generation. Nonetheless, half trials evoked stronger activation on antisaccades than on prosaccades in the frontal eye field (FEF), supplementary eye field (SEF), left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and precuneus. Greater antisaccade response-related activation was found in FEF, SEF, IPS, and precuneus but not in DLPFC or ACC. These results demonstrate greater preparatory activation for antisaccades versus prosaccades in frontoparietal areas and suggest that prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex are more involved in presetting the saccade network for the antisaccade task than generating the actual antisaccade response.

pmid_18266217,The creative brain: investigation of brain activity during creative problem solving by means of EEG and FMRI.,,"Cortical activity in the EEG alpha band has proven to be particularly sensitive to creativity-related demands, but its functional meaning in the context of creative cognition has not been clarified yet. Specifically, increases in alpha activity (i.e., alpha synchronisation) in response to creative thinking can be interpreted in different ways: As a functional correlate of cortical idling, as a sign of internal top-down activity or, more specifically, as selective inhibition of brain regions. We measured brain activity during creative thinking in two studies employing different neurophysiological measurement methods (EEG and fMRI). In both studies, participants worked on four verbal tasks differentially drawing on creative idea generation. The EEG study revealed that the generation of original ideas was associated with alpha synchronisation in frontal brain regions and with a diffuse and widespread pattern of alpha synchronisation over parietal cortical regions. The fMRI study revealed that task performance was associated with strong activation in frontal regions of the left hemisphere. In addition, we found task-specific effects in parietotemporal brain areas. The findings suggest that EEG alpha band synchronisation during creative thinking can be interpreted as a sign of active cognitive processes rather than cortical idling. ",
pmid_18954473,Frontal contributions to face processing differences in autism: evidence from fMRI of inverted face processing.,,"Functional neuroimaging studies of face processing deficits in autism have typically focused on visual processing regions, such as the fusiform face area (FFA), which have shown reduced activity in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), though inconsistently. We recently reported reduced activity in the inferior frontal region in ASD, implicating impaired mirror-neuron systems during face processing. In the present study, we used fMRI during a face processing task in which subjects had to match faces presented in the upright versus inverted position. Typically developing (TD) children showed a classic behavioral inversion effect, increased reaction time for inverted faces, while this effect was significantly reduced in ASD subjects. The fMRI data showed similar responses in the fusiform face area for ASD and TD children, with both groups demonstrating increased activation for inverted faces. However, the groups did differ in several brain regions implicated in social cognition, particularly prefrontal cortex and amygdala. These data suggest that the behavioral differences in processing upright versus inverted faces for TD children are related not to visual information processing but to the social significance of the stimuli. Our results are consistent with other recent studies implicating frontal and limbic dysfunction during face processing in autism. ",
pmid_20573575,The hybrid GLM-ICA investigation on the neural mechanism of acupoint ST36: an fMRI study.,,"Ample clinical reports and neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that the acupuncture has sustained effects after manipulation. However, most previous fMRI studies of acupuncture have paid little attention to this issue, only investigating on the manipulation effects. In the current study, we attempted to explore both acupuncture effects, which have positive influence to therapeutic efficiency, to reveal the neural mechanism of acupuncture. This paper combined the conventional general linear model (GLM) and independent component analysis (ICA) to study the topography and the temporal feature of brain activity to detect the brain responses to stimulation at ST36 (Zusanli) and a sham acupoint. The results showed that the manipulation-related effects and the sustained acupuncture effects separately induced statistically significant increases/decreases in the cortical-subcortical areas, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), supplementary motor area (SMA) primary/secondary somatosensory cortex (SI/SII), occipital cortices and midbrain. Our findings suggested that the analgesia effects of ST36 integrated sophisticated physiological and psychological procedures. In addition, our results have shed light on methodology in acupuncture research. ",
pmid_20816040,Enhanced prefrontal function with pharmacotherapy on a response inhibition task in adolescent bipolar disorder.,,"The aim of the current study is to determine whether pharmacotherapy normalizes cognitive circuitry function supporting voluntary behavioral inhibition in adolescent bipolar disorder. Healthy controls and unmedicated patients with DSM-IV adolescent bipolar disorder in manic, mixed, or hypomanic episodes were matched on demographics and IQ (n = 13 per group; mean age = 14.4 ± 2.4 years). Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies were performed at baseline and after 14 weeks, during which time patients with adolescent bipolar disorder were treated initially with second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) followed by lamotrigine monotherapy. The primary outcome measure was a Response Inhibition Task, which involved a planned motor response, already ""on the way"" to execution, that had to be voluntarily inhibited by the subjects in the trials in which a stop signal was presented. There were 6 blocks, each with a predominant rate of either ""go"" or ""stop"" trials. The study was conducted from June 2006 through July 2009. All patients showed significant improvement (P < .001) in both the manic and depressive symptoms from baseline. Behavioral data showed that accuracy improved over 14 weeks in patients and healthy controls. Significant time by group interaction effects for the difference between stop versus go blocks showed greater increases of activation in prefrontal (left inferior and middle frontal gyri and medial frontal gyrus bilaterally) and temporal (left superior temporal gyrus and right middle temporal gyrus) regions and greater decreases in activation in right putamen and bilateral thalamus at follow-up in the adolescent bipolar disorder group than in healthy controls. Increased ventrolateral prefrontal cortex function was related to clinical treatment response. Treatment with SGAs followed by lamotrigine monotherapy enhanced prefrontal and temporal lobe activity during a Response Inhibition Task demonstrating the reversal of disorder-relevant neural circuitry dysfunction in patients with adolescent bipolar disorder. Patient performance was not slowed down with this treatment regimen. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00176228. ",
pmid_19913101,The development of performance-monitoring function in the posterior medial frontal cortex.,,"Despite its critical role in performance-monitoring, the development of posterior medial prefrontal cortex (pMFC) in goal-directed behaviors remains poorly understood. Performance monitoring depends on distinct, but related functions that may differentially activate the pMFC, such as monitoring response conflict and detecting errors. Developmental differences in conflict- and error-related activations, coupled with age-related changes in behavioral performance, may confound attempts to map the maturation of pMFC functions. To characterize the development of pMFC-based performance monitoring functions, we segregated interference and error-processing, while statistically controlling for performance. Twenty-one adults and 23 youth performed an event-related version of the Multi-Source Interference Task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Linear modeling of interference and error contrast estimates derived from the pMFC were regressed on age, while covarying for performance. Interference- and error-processing were associated with robust activation of the pMFC in both youth and adults. Among youth, interference- and error-related activation of the pMFC increased with age, independent of performance. Greater accuracy associated with greater pMFC activity during error commission in both groups. Increasing pMFC response to interference and errors occurs with age, likely contributing to the improvement of performance monitoring capacity during development. ",

In healthy individuals, affective perspective taking has proven to be an effective means to elicit empathy and concern for others. To examine neural responses in individuals who vary in psychopathy during affective perspective taking, 121 incarcerated males, classified as high (n = 37; Hare psychopathy checklist-revised, PCL-R ≥ 30), intermediate (n = 44; PCL-R between 21 and 29), and low (n = 40; PCL-R ≤ 20) psychopaths, were scanned while viewing stimuli depicting bodily injuries and adopting an imagine-self and an imagine-other perspective. During the imagine-self perspective, participants with high psychopathy showed a typical response within the network involved in empathy for pain, including the anterior insula (aINS), anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC), supplementary motor area (SMA), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), somatosensory cortex, and right amygdala. Conversely, during the imagine-other perspective, psychopaths exhibited an atypical pattern of brain activation and effective connectivity seeded in the anterior insula and amygdala with the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). The response in the amygdala and insula was inversely correlated with PCL-R Factor 1 (interpersonal/affective) during the imagine-other perspective. In high psychopaths, scores on PCL-R Factor 1 predicted the neural response in ventral striatum when imagining others in pain. These patterns of brain activation and effective connectivity associated with differential perspective-taking provide a better understanding of empathy dysfunction in psychopathy, and have the potential to inform intervention programs for this complex clinical problem.

pmid_16337921,Two cortical systems for reaching in central and peripheral vision.,,"Parietal lesions in humans can produce a specific disruption of visually guided hand movement, termed optic ataxia. The fact that the deficit mainly occurs in peripheral vision suggests that reaching in foveal and extrafoveal vision rely on two different neural substrates. In the present study, we have directly tested this hypothesis by event-related fMRI in healthy subjects. Brain activity was measured when participants reached toward central or peripheral visual targets. Our results confirm the existence of two systems, differently modulated by the two conditions. Reaching in central vision involved a restricted network including the medial intraparietal sulcus (mIPS) and the caudal part of the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd). Reaching in peripheral vision activated in addition the parieto-occipital junction (POJ) and a more rostral part of PMd. These results show that reaching to the peripheral visual field engages a more extensive cortical network than reaching to the central visual field. ",
pmid_11305901,Distinct neural systems for the encoding and recognition of topography and faces.,,"In a series of three positron emission tomography experiments the functional neuroanatomy of four different types of visual stimuli was investigated within the same experimental context. The stimuli were unknown buildings, landscapes, human faces, and animal faces. The purpose of the present study was to compare the stimulus types, both within the same category and across category, by examining if, at encoding (with several seconds exposure to each stimulus) or recognition (over time scales of minutes compared to the seconds of usual perception/one-back studies), common or different neural circuits were activated for all types/categories of stimuli. Within category and although visually very different, the encoding of both buildings and landscapes activated a similar set of brain regions, including bilateral parahippocampal gyrus. This was in contrast to the encoding of both human and animal faces, both of which resulted in activation of the fusiform gyrus bilaterally. Despite the perceptual inputs being identical to those during encoding, the recognition of both buildings and landscapes activated only unilateral right parahippocampal gyrus, while recognition of both human and animal faces activated unilateral right fusiform gyrus. In addition, right superior frontal gyrus and right inferior and medial parietal areas were more active during recognition compared with encoding for all stimulus types. Overall the data identify differential patterns of activation for encoding compared with retrieval of visual stimuli. Furthermore, medial temporal structures specifically are involved in the explicit learning and long-term recognition of topographically relevant stimuli, be they buildings or landscapes, while lateral temporal structures support nontopographical learning and recognition, in this case either human or animal faces.

pmid_22270353,Impaired executive function signals in motor brain regions in Parkinson's disease.,,"Recent evidence has shown that patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) often display deficits in executive functions, such as planning for future behavior, and these deficits may stem from pathologies in prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia circuits that are critical to executive control. Using the antisaccade task (look away from a visual stimulus), we show that when the preparatory 'readiness' to perform a given action is dissociated from the actual execution of that action, PD patients off and on dopamine medication display behavioral impairments and reduced cortical brain activation that cannot be explained by a pathology related to dysfunction in movement execution. Rather, they show that the appropriate task set signals were not in place in motor regions prior to execution, resulting in impairments in the control of subsequent voluntary movement. This is the first fMRI study of antisaccade deficits in Parkinson's disease, and importantly, the findings point to a critical role of the basal ganglia in translating signals related to rule representation (executive) into those governing voluntary motor behavior.

Conventional MRI, 3D structure images and resting state functional MRI were performed in 30 migraine patients without aura (MwoA) and 22 healthy controls (HC). The lateral geniculate nucleus volumes and the functional connectivity (FC) of bilateral lateral geniculate nucleus were computed and compared between groups. The lateral geniculate nucleus volumes in patient groups did not differ from the controls. The brain regions with increased FC of the left LGN mainly located in the left cerebellum and right lingual gyrus in MwoA compared with HC. The increased FC of right LGN located in left inferior frontal gyrus in MwoA compared with HC. The correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between VLSQ-8 score and the increased FC of left cerebellum and right lingual gyrus. Photophobia in MwoA could be mediated by abnormal resting state functional connectivity in visual processing regions, the pain perception regulatory network and emotion regulation network. This result is valuable to further understanding about the clinical manifestation and pathogenesis of migraine. ",

Schizophrenia","Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) are one of the cardinal symptoms of schizophrenia (SZ). Cerebral dysfunction may represent pathophysiological underpinnings behind AVHs in SZ. However, regional and network functional deficits for AVHs in SZ remain to be identified. Seventeen medication-naïve first-episode SZ patients with AVHs, 15 without AVHs, and 19 healthy controls (HCs) were studied using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We compared the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) among these subjects. Areas with both ALFF and ReHo alterations were used as seeds in functional connectivity (FC) analysis. Then we performed correlation analysis between image measures and symptoms and receiver operating characteristic analysis. One-way analysis of variance showed significant differences of ALFF and ReHo in the bilateral putamen, thereby being used as seeds. SZ patients with AVHs showed decreased ALFF in the left putamen, increased ReHo in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and increased right putamen-seeded FC with the left DLPFC and Broca's area relative to those without AVHs. Furthermore, the increased strength of the connectivity between the right putamen and left Broca's area correlated with the severity of SZ symptoms. Both patient groups demonstrated hypoconnectivity within frontal/parietal/temporal cortico-striatal-cerebellar networks compared with HCs. AVHs in SZ may be caused by abnormal regional function in the putamen and prefrontal cortex, as well as hyperconnectivity between them. The putamen-related regional and network functional deficits may reflect imbalance in neuromodulation of AVHs in SZ. Furthermore, dysconnectivity within cortico-striatal-cerebellar networks might subserve the pathogenesis of SZ. ",

subgenual cingulate cortex","Aberrant activity of the subcallosal cingulate (SCC) is a common theme across pharmacologic treatment efficacy prediction studies. The functioning of the SCC in psychotherapeutic interventions is relatively understudied, as are functional differences among SCC subdivisions. We conducted functional connectivity analyses (rsFC) on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, collected before and after a course of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), using seeds from three SCC subdivisions. Resting-state data were collected from unmedicated patients with current MDD (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 > 16) before and after 14-sessions of CBT monotherapy. Treatment outcome was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Rostral anterior cingulate (rACC), anterior subcallosal cingulate (aSCC), and Brodmann's area 25 (BA25) masks were used as seeds in connectivity analyses that assessed baseline rsFC and symptom severity, changes in connectivity related to symptom improvement after CBT, and prediction of treatment outcomes using whole-brain baseline connectivity. Pretreatment BDI negatively correlated with pretreatment rACC ~ dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and aSCC ~ lateral prefrontal cortex rsFC. In a region-of-interest longitudinal analysis, rsFC between these regions increased post-treatment (p < 0.05FDR). In whole-brain analyses, BA25 ~ paracentral lobule and rACC ~ paracentral lobule connectivities decreased post-treatment. Whole-brain baseline rsFC with SCC did not predict clinical improvement. rsFC features of rACC and aSCC, but not BA25, correlated inversely with baseline depression severity, and increased following CBT. Subdivisions of SCC involved in top-down emotion regulation may be more involved in cognitive interventions, while BA25 may be more informative for interventions targeting bottom-up processing. Results emphasize the importance of subdividing the SCC in connectivity analyses. ",
pmid_20368513,Neural processing of reward and loss in girls at risk for major depression.,,"Deficits in reward processing and their neural correlates have been associated with major depression. However, it is unclear if these deficits precede the onset of depression or are a consequence of this disorder. To determine whether anomalous neural processing of reward characterizes children at familial risk for depression in the absence of a personal history of diagnosable disorder. Comparison of neural activity among children at low and high risk for depression as they process reward and loss. University functional magnetic resonance imaging facility. Thirteen 10- to 14-year-old never-disordered daughters of mothers with recurrent depression (""high risk"") and 13 age-matched never-disordered daughters with no family history of depression (""low risk""). Main Outcome Measure Neural activity, as measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging, in key reward and attention neural circuitry during anticipation and receipt of reward and loss. While anticipating gains, high-risk participants showed less activation than did their low-risk counterparts in the putamen and left insula but showed greater activation in the right insula. When receiving punishment, high-risk participants showed greater activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus than did low-risk participants, who showed greater activation in the caudate and putamen. Familial risk for depression affects neural mechanisms underlying the processing of reward and loss; young girls at risk for depression exhibit anomalies in the processing of reward and loss before the onset of depressive symptoms. Longitudinal studies are needed to examine whether these characteristics predict the subsequent onset of depression. ",
pmid_15473974,Neural correlates of behavioral preference for culturally familiar drinks.,,"Coca-Cola (Coke) and Pepsi are nearly identical in chemical composition, yet humans routinely display strong subjective preferences for one or the other. This simple observation raises the important question of how cultural messages combine with content to shape our perceptions; even to the point of modifying behavioral preferences for a primary reward like a sugared drink. We delivered Coke and Pepsi to human subjects in behavioral taste tests and also in passive experiments carried out during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Two conditions were examined: (1) anonymous delivery of Coke and Pepsi and (2) brand-cued delivery of Coke and Pepsi. For the anonymous task, we report a consistent neural response in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex that correlated with subjects' behavioral preferences for these beverages. In the brand-cued experiment, brand knowledge for one of the drinks had a dramatic influence on expressed behavioral preferences and on the measured brain responses. ",

resting-state fMRI
schizophrenia","Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder associated with disrupted connectivity within the thalamic-cortico-cerebellar network. Resting-state functional connectivity studies have reported thalamic hypoconnectivity with the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex as well as thalamic hyperconnectivity with sensory cortical regions in SZ patients compared with healthy comparison participants (HCs). However, fundamental questions remain regarding the clinical significance of these connectivity abnormalities. Resting state seed-based functional connectivity was used to investigate thalamus to whole brain connectivity using multi-site data including 183 SZ patients and 178 matched HCs. Statistical significance was based on a voxel-level FWE-corrected height threshold of p < 0.001. The relationships between positive and negative symptoms of SZ and regions of the brain demonstrating group differences in thalamic connectivity were examined. HC and SZ participants both demonstrated widespread positive connectivity between the thalamus and cortical regions. Compared with HCs, SZ patients had reduced thalamic connectivity with bilateral cerebellum and anterior cingulate cortex. In contrast, SZ patients had greater thalamic connectivity with multiple sensory-motor regions, including bilateral pre- and post-central gyrus, middle/inferior occipital gyrus, and middle/superior temporal gyrus. Thalamus to middle temporal gyrus connectivity was positively correlated with hallucinations and delusions, while thalamus to cerebellar connectivity was negatively correlated with delusions and bizarre behavior. Thalamic hyperconnectivity with sensory regions and hypoconnectivity with cerebellar regions in combination with their relationship to clinical features of SZ suggest that thalamic dysconnectivity may be a core neurobiological feature of SZ that underpins positive symptoms.

pmid_20350171,Beyond the memory mechanism: person-selective and nonselective processes in recognition of personally familiar faces.,,"Special processes recruited during the recognition of personally familiar people have been assumed to reflect the rich episodic and semantic information that selectively represents each person. However, the processes may also include person nonselective ones, which may require interpretation in terms beyond the memory mechanism. To examine this possibility, we assessed decrease in differential activation during the second presentation of an identical face (repetition suppression) as an index of person selectivity. During fMRI, pictures of personally familiar, famous, and unfamiliar faces were presented to healthy subjects who performed a familiarity judgment. Each face was presented once in the first half of the experiment and again in the second half. The right inferior temporal and left inferior frontal gyri were activated during the recognition of both types of familiar faces initially, and this activation was suppressed with repetition. Among preferentially activated regions for personally familiar over famous faces, robust suppression in differential activation was exhibited in the bilateral medial and anterior temporal structures, left amygdala, and right posterior STS, all of which are known to process episodic and semantic information. On the other hand, suppression was minimal in the posterior cingulate, medial prefrontal, right inferior frontal, and intraparietal regions, some of which were implicated in social cognition and cognitive control. Thus, the recognition of personally familiar people is characterized not only by person-selective representation but also by nonselective processes requiring a research framework beyond the memory mechanism, such as a social adaptive response.

pmid_9354332,Brain regions differentially involved in remembering what and when: a PET study.,,"Recollecting a past episode involves remembering not only what happened but also when it happened. We used positron emission tomography (PET) to directly contrast the neural correlates of item and temporalorder memory. Subjects studied a list of words and were then scanned while retrieving information about what words were in the list or when they occurred within the list. Item retrieval was related to increased neural activity in medial temporal and basal forebrain regions, whereas temporal-order retrieval was associated with activations in dorsal prefrontal, cuneus/precuneus, and right posterior parietal regions. The dissociation between temporal and frontal lobe regions confirms and extends previous lesion data. The results show that temporal-order retrieval involves a network of frontal and posterior brain regions. ",
pmid_22306865,Alterations of the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in treatment-resistant and treatment-response depression: a resting-state fMRI study.,,"Patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and those with treatment-response depression (TSD) respond to antidepressants differently and previous studies have commonly reported different brain networks in resistant and nonresistant patients. Using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) approach, we explored ALFF values of the brain regions in TRD and TSD patients at resting state to test the hypothesis of the different brain networks in TRD and TSD patients. Eighteen TRD patients, 17 TSD patients and 17 gender-, age-, and education-matched healthy subjects participated in the resting-state fMRI scans. There are widespread differences in ALFF values among TRD patients, TSD patients and healthy subjects throughout the cerebellum, the visual recognition circuit (middle temporal gyrus, middle/inferior occipital gyrus and fusiform), the hate circuit (putamen), the default circuit (ACC and medial frontal gyrus) and the risk/action circuit (inferior frontal gyrus). The differences in brain circuits between the TRD and TSD patients are mainly in the cerebellum, the visual recognition circuit and the default circuit. The affected brain circuits of TRD patients might be partly different from those of TSD patients. ",
pmid_25692068,Functional activation and effective connectivity differences in adolescent marijuana users performing a simulated gambling task.,,"Background. Adolescent marijuana use is associated with structural and functional differences in forebrain regions while performing memory and attention tasks. In the present study, we investigated neural processing in adolescent marijuana users experiencing rewards and losses. Fourteen adolescents with frequent marijuana use (>5 uses per week) and 14 nonuser controls performed a computer task where they were required to guess the outcome of a simulated coin flip while undergoing magnetic resonance imaging. Results. Across all participants, ""Wins"" and ""Losses"" were associated with activations including cingulate, middle frontal, superior frontal, and inferior frontal gyri and declive activations. Relative to controls, users had greater activity in the middle and inferior frontal gyri, caudate, and claustrum during ""Wins"" and greater activity in the anterior and posterior cingulate, middle frontal gyrus, insula, claustrum, and declive during ""Losses."" Effective connectivity analyses revealed similar overall network interactions among these regions for users and controls during both ""Wins"" and ""Losses."" However, users and controls had significantly different causal interactions for 10 out of 28 individual paths during the ""Losses"" condition. Conclusions. Collectively, these results indicate adolescent marijuana users have enhanced neural responses to simulated monetary rewards and losses and relatively subtle differences in effective connectivity.

pmid_23115195,Cognitive-affective neural plasticity following active-controlled mindfulness intervention.,,"Mindfulness meditation is a set of attention-based, regulatory, and self-inquiry training regimes. Although the impact of mindfulness training (MT) on self-regulation is well established, the neural mechanisms supporting such plasticity are poorly understood. MT is thought to act through interoceptive salience and attentional control mechanisms, but until now conflicting evidence from behavioral and neural measures renders difficult distinguishing their respective roles. To resolve this question we conducted a fully randomized 6 week longitudinal trial of MT, explicitly controlling for cognitive and treatment effects with an active-control group. We measured behavioral metacognition and whole-brain blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals using functional MRI during an affective Stroop task before and after intervention in healthy human subjects. Although both groups improved significantly on a response-inhibition task, only the MT group showed reduced affective Stroop conflict. Moreover, the MT group displayed greater dorsolateral prefrontal cortex responses during executive processing, consistent with increased recruitment of top-down mechanisms to resolve conflict. In contrast, we did not observe overall group-by-time interactions on negative affect-related reaction times or BOLD responses. However, only participants with the greatest amount of MT practice showed improvements in response inhibition and increased recruitment of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and right anterior insula during negative valence processing. Our findings highlight the importance of active control in MT research, indicate unique neural mechanisms for progressive stages of mindfulness training, and suggest that optimal application of MT may differ depending on context, contrary to a one-size-fits-all approach.

pmid_19236528,Shared and disorder-specific prefrontal abnormalities in boys with pure attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder compared to boys with pure CD during interference inhibition and attention allocation.,,"Inhibitory and attention deficits have been suggested to be shared problems of disruptive behaviour disorders. Patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and patients with conduct disorder (CD) show deficits in tasks of attention allocation and interference inhibition. However, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of inhibitory and attention control has only been investigated in patients with ADHD, including comorbidity with CD, finding fronto-striatal and temporo-parietal dysfunction. This study investigates differences and commonalities in functional neural networks mediating interference inhibition and attention allocation between medication-naïve children and adolescents with pure CD and those with pure ADHD. Event-related fMRI was used to compare brain activation of 13 boys with non-comorbid CD, 20 boys with non-comorbid ADHD and 20 healthy comparison boys during a Simon task that measures interference inhibition and controls for attention allocation, thus tapping into interference inhibition and selective attention networks. During interference inhibition, both patient groups shared reduced activation compared to controls in right superior temporal lobe and in predominantly right precuneus. During the oddball condition, both patient groups showed reduced activation compared to healthy control children in right medial prefrontal lobe. However, only ADHD patients showed a disorder-specific under-activation compared to the other two groups in an extensive activation cluster in left inferior prefrontal cortex. This study shows shared dysfunction in both patients groups in right hemispheric temporal and parietal brain regions during interference inhibition and in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during attention allocation. Ventrolateral prefrontal dysfunction, however, was specific to ADHD and not observed in patients with CD in the context of attention allocation. The findings suggest that the typically reduced functional activation in patients with ADHD in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex may be specific to the disorder, at least when compared to patients with CD.

pmid_24535464,Neuromodulatory treatments for chronic pain: efficacy and mechanisms.,,"Chronic pain is common, and the available treatments do not provide adequate relief for most patients. Neuromodulatory interventions that modify brain processes underlying the experience of pain have the potential to provide substantial relief for some of these patients. The purpose of this Review is to summarize the state of knowledge regarding the efficacy and mechanisms of noninvasive neuromodulatory treatments for chronic pain. The findings provide support for the efficacy and positive side-effect profile of hypnosis, and limited evidence for the potential efficacy of meditation training, noninvasive electrical stimulation procedures, and neurofeedback procedures. Mechanisms research indicates that hypnosis influences multiple neurophysiological processes involved in the experience of pain. Evidence also indicates that mindfulness meditation has both immediate and long-term effects on cortical structures and activity involved in attention, emotional responding and pain. Less is known about the mechanisms of other neuromodulatory treatments. On the basis of the data discussed in this Review, training in the use of self-hypnosis might be considered a viable 'first-line' approach to treat chronic pain. More-definitive research regarding the benefits and costs of meditation training, noninvasive brain stimulation and neurofeedback is needed before these treatments can be recommended for the treatment of chronic pain.

pmid_15543553,Magnetic resonance study of the influence of tissue damage and cortical reorganization on PASAT performance at the earliest stage of multiple sclerosis.,,"We sought to determine the influence of tissue damage and the potential impact of cortical reorganization on the performance to the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) in patients at the earliest stage of multiple sclerosis (MS). Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments using PASAT as paradigm were carried out in 18 patients with clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of MS (CISSMS) compared to 18 controls. MTR histogram analyses showed structural abnormalities in patients involving the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) but also the gray matter (GM). Mean PASAT scores were significantly lower in the group of patients taken as a whole, and were correlated with the mean NAWM MTR value. No correlation was observed between PASAT scores and GM MTR. However, in the subgroup of patients with normal PASAT performance (n = 9), fMRI showed larger activations in bilateral Brodmann area 45 (BA45) and right BA44 compared to that in controls (n = 18). In these areas with potentially compensatory reorganization, the whole group of patients (n = 18) showed significantly greater activation than controls (n = 18). Activation in the right BA45 was inversely correlated with the mean NAWM MTR and the peak position of GM MTR histograms of patients. This study indicates that even at the earliest stage of MS, cortical reorganization is present inside the executive system of working memory and could tend to limit the determinant functional impact of NAWM injury on the execution of the PASAT.

pmid_17151834,Effects of treatment with the atypical neuroleptic quetiapine on working memory function: a functional MRI follow-up investigation.,,"Working memory as a part of higher-order executive functions is defined by the parallel storage and processing of information. Recent functional fMRI studies have revealed a functional, interregional disintegration of a neuronal network connecting cortical, subcortical and cerebellar regions in schizophrenic patients (SZ). Cognitive impairment in working memory is a core psychopathological correlate of schizophrenic symptoms. Atypical neuroleptics such as quetiapine have shown good efficacy in treating positive and negative symptoms. The presented study evaluated the impact of a neuroleptic steady state treatment with quetiapine on the altered working memory activation patterns in schizophrenia. Patients were examined by fMRI at baseline and after 12 weeks of steady state treatment with quetiapine. Matched healthy controls (HC) underwent baseline examination. In the scanner, stimuli were presented in a 2-back and 0-back condition of a working memory (wm) paradigm, whereby a degraded and a non-degraded version were used each time. Additionally, behavioural responses (reaction time to target stimuli and error ratio) were measured. At baseline, healthy controls revealed increased activity in the frontal lobe, especially in regions of the prefrontal cortex. Compared to HC, SZ showed hypoactivation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) bilaterally for the 2-back condition. In the 2-back degraded condition there was a hypoactivation in both, the right DLPFC and the VLPFC. Additionally, patients showed bilaterally decreased activation in the basalganglia in the 2-back and in the right caudatus in the 2-back degraded condition compared to healthy controls. After treatment with quetiapine, patients activations patterns were increased. The pre-post comparison of the 2-back condition revealed a significant increase of activation in the left VLPFC at a significance level of 0.001 (uncorrected). The 2-back degraded condition led to a significant activation pattern in the lingual gyrus and the right precuneus. In both wm conditions, at baseline there were no differences in reaction time but only a worse performance in SZ. After treatment, behavioural measurement of responses, including reaction time and performance, showed slight improvements in SZ, although these did not reach statistical significance. The neuronal networks underlying working memory are clearly altered in schizophrenia. After 12 weeks of treatment with quetiapine monotherapy, patients showed significant clinical improvement and revealed increased BOLD activity in the VLPFC during a working memory task, although there was no improvement of cognitive performance.

pmid_23825583,A functional magnetic resonance imaging study of pathophysiological changes responsible for mirror movements in Parkinson's disease.,,"Mirror movements correspond to involuntary movements observed in the limb contralateral to the one performing voluntary movement. They can be observed in Parkinson's disease (PD) but their pathophysiology remains unclear. The present study aims at identifying their neural correlates in PD using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Ten control subjects and 14-off drug patients with asymmetrical right-sided PD were included (8 with left-sided mirror movements during right-hand movements, and 6 without mirror movements). Between-group comparisons of BOLD signal were performed during right-hand movements and at rest (p<0.005 uncorrected). The comparison between PD patients with and without mirror movements showed that mirror movements were associated with an overactivation of the insula, precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex bilaterally and of the left inferior frontal cortex and with a deactivation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and pre-supplementary motor area and occipital cortex. These data suggest that mirror movements in Parkinson's disease are promoted by: 1- a deactivation of the non-mirroring inhibitory network (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, pre-supplementary motor area); 2- an overactivation of prokinetic areas (notably the insula). The concomitant overactivation of a proactive inhibitory network (including the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus) could reflect a compensatory inhibition of mirror movements. ",
pmid_18097655,Reward system activation in schizophrenic patients switched from typical neuroleptics to olanzapine.,,"High blockade of dopamine D2 receptors in the ventral striatum including the nucleus accumbens may interfere with reward anticipation and cause secondary negative symptoms such as apathy or anhedonia. This may not be the case with newer neuroleptics such as olanzapine, which show less dopamine D2 receptor blockade and a faster off-rate from the receptor. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the blood oxygenation level dependent response in the ventral striatum of schizophrenics medicated with typical neuroleptics (T1) and after switching them to olanzapine (T2) and of healthy control subjects at corresponding time points during reward anticipation. Ten schizophrenics, while medicated with typical neuroleptics (T1) and after having been switched to olanzapine (T2), and ten matched healthy volunteers participated in a monetary incentive delay task, in which visual cues predicted that a rapid response to a subsequent target stimulus would either result in monetary gain or have no consequence. During reward anticipation, healthy volunteers showed significantly higher ventral striatal activation compared to schizophrenic patients treated with typical neuroleptics but not olanzapine, which was reflected in a significant interaction between group and session. In patients treated with typical neuroleptics, but not with olanzapine, decreased left ventral striatal activation was correlated with negative symptoms. Failure to activate the ventral striatum during reward anticipation was pharmacologically state-dependent and observed only in patients treated with typical neuroleptics but not with olanzapine, which may indicate that this drug did not induce secondary negative symptoms via interference with reward anticipation.

pmid_28384269,"Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in first-episode, drug-naïve depressive patients: A 5-year retrospective study.",,"Despite different treatments and courses of illness, depressive symptoms appear similar in bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), causing BD with an onset of depressive episode being frequently misdiagnosed as MDD, and leading to inappropriate treatment and poor clinical outcomes. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore underlying neural basis to distinguish BD from MDD. The medical records of 80 first-episode, drug-naïve depressive patients with an initial diagnosis of MDD and illness duration of at least 5 years were reviewed retrospectively for this study. Fourteen bipolar depressed patients with a diagnosis conversion from MDD to BD, 14 patients with diagnosis of MDD, and 14 healthy subjects demographically matched with the BD group, were selected to participate in the study. Firstly, we examined whether there were differences among the three groups in whole brain fALFF during resting state. Secondly, clusters showing group differences in fALFF in any two groups were chosen as regions of interest (ROI) and then correlation between clinical features and fALFF values of ROIs were calculated. The BD group showed increased fALFF in bilateral putamen relative to both the MDD group and controls, while the MDD group exhibited decreased fALFF in left superior frontal gyrus (SFG) relative to both the BD group and controls (p < 0.05, corrected). Positive correlations between abnormality in the putamen and symptom severity were observed (significant for the MDD group, p = 0.043; marginally significant for the BD group, p = 0.060/0.076). These results implicate that abnormalities of key regions in the striatum and prefrontal areas may be trait markers for BD and MDD. ",
pmid_15336514,Abnormal activity patterns in premotor cortex during sequence learning in autistic patients.,,"Evidence for frontal abnormality in autism has accumulated in recent years. Our own studies have shown abnormal activation in prefrontal cortex during finger tapping and visuomotor coordination. Studies in healthy adults suggest reduced premotor and increased prefrontal activity during advanced learning stages. We examined hemodynamic changes during visuomotor learning in autistic patients. We studied eight high-functioning autistic patients and eight control subjects during learning of an 8-digit sequence over a period of 8 min, using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Autistic patients showed overall less prefrontal activation during late visuomotor learning; however, the main finding was a complementary one of enhanced activation in right pericentral and premotor cortex. In the autism group, Brodmann areas 3, 4, and 6 of the right hemisphere became more involved during late learning stages (trials 25-48), compared with early stages (trials 1-24). This effect was not seen in the control group. Our findings suggests that in autistic patients 1) primary sensorimotor and premotor cortex, which is normally predominant in early stages of visuomotor learning, plays an atypical role in later stages, even when learning is evident; and 2) handedness and side of execution interact with asymmetry of visuomotor learning activations, contrary to what is seen in normal adults.

pmid_11907690,Pattern of cortical reorganization in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study.,,"Depending on individual lesion location and extent, reorganization of the human motor system has been observed with a high interindividual variability. In addition, variability of forces exerted, of motor effort, and of movement strategies complicates the interpretation of functional imaging studies. We hypothesize that a general pattern of reorganization can be identified if a homogeneous patient population is chosen and experimental conditions are controlled. Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and healthy volunteers were trained to perform a simple finger flexion task with 10% of each individual's maximum grip force with constant movement amplitude and frequency. The activation pattern in ALS patients was distinctly different to that in healthy controls: In ALS patients, motor cortex activation was located more anteriorly, encompassing the premotor gyrus. The cluster volume within the supplementary motor area (SMA) was higher and shifted toward the pre-SMA. Contralateral inferior area 6 and bilateral parietal area 40 revealed higher cluster volumes. Our results demonstrate a general pattern of functional changes after motor neuron degeneration. They support the concept of a structurally parallel and functionally specialized organization of voluntary motor control. Degeneration of the first and second motor neurons leads to enhanced recruitment of motor areas usually involved in initiation and planning of movement. Partial compensation between functionally related motor areas seems to be a strategy to optimize performance if the most efficient pathway is unavailable. ",
pmid_12499108,Explaining modulation of reasoning by belief.,,"Although deductive reasoning is a closed system, one's beliefs about the world can influence validity judgements. To understand the associated functional neuroanatomy of this belief-bias we studied 14 volunteers using event-related fMRI, as they performed reasoning tasks under neutral, facilitatory and inhibitory belief conditions. We found evidence for the engagement of a left temporal lobe system during belief-based reasoning and a bilateral parietal lobe system during belief-neutral reasoning. Activation of right lateral prefrontal cortex was evident when subjects inhibited a prepotent response associated with belief-bias and correctly completed a logical task, a finding consistent with its putative role in cognitive monitoring. By contrast, when logical reasoning was overcome by belief-bias, there was engagement of ventral medial prefrontal cortex, a region implicated in affective processing. This latter involvement suggests that belief-bias effects in reasoning may be mediated through an influence of emotional processes on reasoning. ",

For this national cross-sectional study, 46 011 adults aged 60 years or older were recruited between March 10, 2015, and Dec 26, 2018, using a multistage, stratified, cluster-sampling method, which considered geographical region, degree of urbanisation, economic development status, and sex and age distribution. 96 sites were randomly selected in 12 provinces and municipalities representative of all socioeconomic and geographical regions in China. Participants were interviewed to obtain data on sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle, medical history, current medications, and family history, and then completed a neuropsychological testing battery administered by a psychological evaluator. The prevalence of dementia (Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and other dementias) and MCI were calculated and the risk factors for different groups were examined using multivariable-adjusted analyses. Overall age-adjusted and sex-adjusted prevalence was estimated to be 6·0% (95% CI 5·8-6·3) for dementia, 3·9% (3·8-4·1) for Alzheimer's disease, 1·6% (1·5-1·7) for vascular dementia, and 0·5% (0·5-0·6) for other dementias. We estimated that 15·07 million (95% CI 14·53-15·62) people aged 60 years or older in China have dementia: 9·83 million (9·39-10·29) with Alzheimer's disease, 3·92 million (3·64-4·22) with vascular dementia, and 1·32 million (1·16-1·50) with other dementias. Overall MCI prevalence was estimated to be 15·5% (15·2-15·9), representing 38·77 million (37·95-39·62) people in China. Dementia and MCI shared similar risk factors including old age (dementia: odds ratios ranging from 2·69 [95% CI 2·43-2·98] to 6·60 [5·24-8·32]; MCI: from 1·89 [1·77-2·00] to 4·70 [3·77-5·87]); female sex (dementia: 1·43 [1·31-1·56]; MCI: 1·51 [1·43-1·59]); parental history of dementia (dementia: 7·20 [5·68-9·12]; MCI: 1·91 [1·48-2·46]); rural residence (dementia: 1·16 [1·06-1·27]; MCI: 1·45 [1·38-1·54]); fewer years of education (dementia: from 1·17 [1·06-1·29] to 1·55 [1·38-1·73]; MCI: from 1·48 [1·39-1·58] to 3·48 [3·25-3·73]); being widowed, divorced, or living alone (dementia: from 2·59 [2·30-2·90] to 2·66 [2·29-3·10]; MCI: from 1·58 [1·44-1·73] to 1·74 [1·56-1·95]); smoking (dementia: 1·85 [1·67-2·04]; MCI: 1·27 [1·19-1·36]), hypertension (dementia: 1·86 [1·70-2·03]; MCI: 1·62 [1·54-1·71] for MCI), hyperlipidaemia (dementia: 1·87 [1·71-2·05]; MCI: 1·29 [1·21-1·37]), diabetes (dementia: 2·14 [1·96-2·34]; MCI: 1·44 [1·35-1·53]), heart disease (dementia: 1·98 [1·73-2·26]; MCI: 1·17 [1·06-1·30]), and cerebrovascular disease (dementia: 5·44 [4·95-5·97]; MCI: 1·49 [1·36-1·62]). Nine of these risk factors are modifiable. Dementia and MCI are highly prevalent in China and share similar risk factors. A prevention strategy should be developed to target the identified risk factors in the MCI population to thwart or slow down disease progression. It is also crucial to optimise the management of dementia and MCI as an important part of China's public health system.

“what-where-when” tripartite pattern","We investigated the neural correlates supporting three kinds of memory judgments after very short delays using naturalistic material. In two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments, subjects watched short movie clips, and after a short retention (1.5-2.5 s), made mnemonic judgments about specific aspects of the clips. In Experiment 1, subjects were presented with two scenes and required to either choose the scene that happened earlier in the clip (""scene-chronology""), or with a correct spatial arrangement (""scene-layout""), or that had been shown (""scene-recognition""). To segregate activity specific to seen versus unseen stimuli, in Experiment 2 only one probe image was presented (either target or foil). Across the two experiments, we replicated three patterns underlying the three specific forms of memory judgment. The precuneus was activated during temporal-order retrieval, the superior parietal cortex was activated bilaterally for spatial-related configuration judgments, whereas the medial frontal cortex during scene recognition. Conjunction analyses with a previous study that used analogous retrieval tasks, but a much longer delay (>1 day), demonstrated that this dissociation pattern is independent of retention delay. We conclude that analogous brain regions mediate task-specific retrieval across vastly different delays, consistent with the proposal of scale-invariance in episodic memory retrieval. ",
pmid_17488204,Neural correlates of positive and negative emotion regulation.,,"The ability to cope adaptively with emotional events by volitionally altering one's emotional reactions is important for psychological and physical health as well as social interaction. Cognitive regulation of emotional responses to aversive events engages prefrontal regions that modulate activity in emotion-processing regions such as the amygdala. However, the neural correlates of the regulation of positive emotions remain largely unexplored. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the neural correlates of cognitively increasing and decreasing emotional reactions to positive and negative stimuli. Participants viewed negative, positive, and neutral pictures while attempting to increase, decrease, or not alter their emotional reactions. Subjective reactions were assessed via on-line ratings. Consistent with previous studies, increasing negative and positive emotion engaged primarily left-lateralized prefrontal regions, whereas decreasing emotion activated bilateral prefrontal regions. Different activations unique to increasing versus decreasing emotion were observed for positive and negative stimuli: Unique increase-related activations were observed only for positive stimuli, whereas unique decrease-related activations were observed only for negative stimuli. Regulation also modulated activity in the amygdala, a key emotion-processing region. Regulation effects on amygdala activity were larger for positive than for negative stimuli, potentially reflecting a greater malleability of positive emotional reactions. Increasing and decreasing positive and negative emotion can thus increase and decrease subjective reactions and associated amygdala activity in line with regulatory goals, and is associated with different patterns of prefrontal activation as a function of emotional valence and regulatory goal.

pmid_16859416,Cortical mechanisms involved in the processing of verbs: an fMRI study.,,"In this study, we investigated two aspects of verb processing: first, whether verbs are processed differently from nouns; and second, how verbal morphology is processed. For this purpose, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare three types of lexical processing in Japanese: the processing of nouns, unmarked active verbs, and inflected passive verbs. Twenty-eight healthy subjects were shown a lexical item and asked to judge whether the presented item was a legal word. Although all three conditions activated the bilateral inferior frontal, occipital, the left middle, and inferior temporal cortices, we found differences in the degree of activation for each condition. Verbs elicited greater activation in the left middle temporal gyrus than nouns, and inflected verbs showed greater activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus than unmarked verbs. This study demonstrates that although verbs are basically processed in the same cortical network as nouns, nouns and verbs elicit different degrees of activation due to the cognitive demands involved in lexical semantic processing. Furthermore, this study also shows that the left inferior frontal cortex is related to the processing of verbal inflectional morphology. ",

This study examined the neurocognitive underpinnings of these neural activations and functional connectivity of the identified brain regions using a within-subject design. Thirty-one native Mandarin speakers performed orthographic, phonological, and semantic judgment tasks during functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results indicated that the three processes shared a core network consisting of a large region in the left prefrontal cortex, fusiform gyrus, and medial superior frontal gyrus but not the superior temporal gyrus. Orthographic processing more strongly recruited the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left superior parietal lobule and bilateral fusiform gyri; semantic processing more strongly recruited the left inferior frontal gyrus and left middle temporal gyrus, whereas phonological processing more strongly activated the dorsal part of the precentral gyrus. Functional connectivity analysis identified a posterior visuospatial network and a frontal phonosemantic network interfaced by the left middle frontal gyrus. We conclude that reading Chinese recruits cognitive resources that correspond to basic task demands with unique features best explained in connection with the individual reading subprocesses. ",

Low back-related leg pain
Regional homogeneity
Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging","Increasing evidence has suggested that central plasticity plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of (chronic) nonspecific low back pain. However, it is unclear how local or short-distance functional interactions contribute to persisting low back-related leg pain (LBLP) due to a specific condition (i.e., lumbar disc herniation). In particular, the multiscale nature of local connectivity properties in various brain regions is still unclear. Here, we used voxelwise Kendall's coefficient of concordance (KCC) and coherence (Cohe) regional homogeneity (ReHo) in the typical (0.01-0.1 Hz) and five specific frequency (slow-6 to slow-2) bands to analyze individual whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans in 25 persistent LBLP patients (duration: 36.7 ± 9.6 months) and 26 healthy control subjects. Between-group differences demonstrated significant alterations in the KCC- and Cohe- ReHo of the right cerebellum posterior lobe, brainstem, left medial prefrontal cortex and bilateral precuneus in LBLP patients in the typical and five specific frequency bands, respectively, along with interactions between disease status and the five specific frequency bands in several regions of the pain matrix and the default-mode network (P < .01, Gaussian random field theory correction). The altered ReHo in the five specific frequency bands was correlated with the duration of pain and two-point discrimination, which were assessed using partial correlational analysis. These results linked the course of disease to the local connectivity properties in specific frequency bands in persisting LBLP. In future studies exploring local connectome association in pain conditions, integrated frequency bands and analytical methods should be considered. ",
pmid_20493670,Decreased regional homogeneity in insula and cerebellum: a resting-state fMRI study in patients with major depression and subjects at high risk for major depression.,,"Functional disconnectivity during the resting state has been observed in subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD), and in subjects at high genetic risk for major depression during task performance. It is hypothesized that functional impairments in certain brain areas are present in patients with MDD and in their first-degree relatives. To test this hypothesis, an analysis of regional homogeneity (ReHo) of the whole brain was performed on 45 subjects. Compared with the control group, subjects with MDD and those at high risk for MDD exhibited significantly decreased ReHo in the right insula and in the left cerebellum. These abnormalities may play an important role in the pathophysiology of depression. ",
pmid_18294618,Ventro-lateral prefrontal activity during working memory is modulated by MAO A genetic variation.,,"Several lines of evidence have highlighted the role of the serotonergic system in working memory (WM) processes. The X-linked Mono-Amine Oxidase A (MAO A) gene, coding for an enzyme especially involved in the serotonin (5-HT) catabolism, presents a well-characterized functional polymorphism consisting in a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) in the promoter region with high activity and low activity variants. The high activity allele carriers have been associated with higher enzyme expression, lower amine concentration and altered prefrontal cortex (PFC) function during motor inhibition, but a direct effect of MAO A genotype on WM-related brain activity has not been demonstrated. We have studied the relationship of this polymorphism to brain activity elicited by a spatial working memory task (n-back) using blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging in 30 healthy male individuals matched for a series of demographic and genetic variables (COMT Val108/158Met). We show that the high activity allele was significantly (p-level<0,001) associated with increased activity of the right ventro-lateral PFC (VLPFC, BA 47) during the high load condition of the n-back task. Our data reveal pronounced genotype-related functional changes in specific prefrontal region (VLPFC) subserving spatial working memory. Moreover, given the well-known role of this area in inhibitory control, our finding also provides new evidence for the involvement of 5-HT in PFC-mediated WM function. ",
pmid_17853413,Memory for familiar environments learned in the remote past: fMRI studies of healthy people and an amnesic person with extensive bilateral hippocampal lesions.,,"Preserved remote spatial memory in amnesic people with bilateral hippocampal damage, including the well-studied case K.C., challenges spatial theories, which assume that the hippocampus is needed to support all allocentric spatial representations, old or new. It remains possible, however, that residual hippocampal tissue is functional and contributes to successful performance. Here, we examine brain activity with fMRI during the retrieval of spatial information in K.C. and in healthy controls using landmark and route stimuli from a premorbidly familiar neighborhood that K.C. can navigate normally. In all participants, activity was found in the parahippocampal cortex, but not in the hippocampus itself, during all navigational tasks on which K.C. performs well, even though part of his hippocampus remains viable. The opposite pattern was observed on a house recognition task, which is inconsequential to navigation, and on which K.C. performed poorly. On that task, K.C. recruited the right hippocampus presumably because even ""familiar"" houses were treated as novel by him, whereas controls recruited occipitotemporal cortex, including parahippocampal cortex. The distinction between recent and remote memory, therefore, may apply as much to spatial theories of hippocampal function as it does to theories emphasizing the role of the hippocampus in other types of explicit memory.

Randomized controlled trial
Transcranial alternating current stimulation","Not all adults with chronic insomnia respond to the recommended therapeutic options of cognitive behavioral therapy and approved hypnotic drugs. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) may offer a novel potential treatment modality for insomnia. This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of tACS for treating adult patients with chronic insomnia. Sixty-two participants with chronic primary insomnia received 20 daily 40-min, 77.5-Hz, 15-mA sessions of active or sham tACS targeting the forehead and both mastoid areas in the laboratory on weekdays for 4 consecutive weeks, followed by a 4-week follow-up period. The primary outcome was response rate measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at week 8. Secondary outcomes were remission rate, insomnia severity, sleep onset latency (SOL), total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency, sleep quality, daily disturbances, and adverse events at the end of the 4-week intervention and at the 4-week follow-up. Of 62 randomized patients, 60 completed the trial. During the 4-week intervention, 1 subject per group withdrew due to loss of interest and time restriction, respectively. Based on PSQI, at 4-week follow-up, the active group had a higher response rate compared to the sham group (53.4% [16/30] vs. 16.7% [5/30], p = 0.009), but remission rates were not different between groups. At the end of the 4-week intervention, the active group had higher response and remission rates than the sham group (p < 0.001 and p = 0.026, respectively). During the trial, compared with the sham group, the active group showed a statistically significant decrease in PSQI total score, a shortened SOL, an increased TST, improved sleep efficiency, and improved sleep quality (p < 0.05 or p < 0.001). Post hoc analysis revealed that, in comparison with the sham group, the active group had improved symptoms, except for daily disturbances, at the end of the 4-week intervention, and significant improvements in all symptoms at the 4-week follow-up. No adverse events or serious adverse responses occurred during the study. The findings show that the tACS applied in the present study has potential as an effective and safe intervention for chronic insomnia within 8 weeks. ",

fMRI","The operculo-insular cortex has been termed the 'homeostatic control center' or 'general magnitude estimator' of the human mind. In this study, somatosensory, nociceptive and caloric vestibular stimuli were applied to reveal, whether there are mainly common, or possibly specific regions activated by one modality alone and whether lateralization effects, time pattern differences or influences of the aversive nature of the stimuli could be observed. Activation of the dorsal posterior insula was caused by all stimuli alike thus terming this area multimodal. Early phases of the noxious heat and caloric vestibular stimulation led to responses in the anterior insula. Using conjunction analyses we found that left- and right-sided tactile stimulation, but not nociceptive stimulation, caused a joint activation of the cytoarchitectonic area OP1 and nociceptive but not tactile stimulation of the anterior insula bilaterally. Tactile activation in the parietal operculum (SII, OP1) was distinct from nociceptive activation (OP3 and frontal operculum). The joint activation by all three stimuli located in the dorsal posterior insula argues for the presence of multisensory structures. The distinct activation of the anterior insula by aversive stimuli and the posterior insula by multisensory signals supports the concept of a partitioned insular cortex recently introduced based on connectivity studies and meta-analyses.

fMRI","Altered interoception, i.e., processing of stimuli from inside the body, has been considered an important component of drug-taking behavior. However, approaches to examine interoceptive sensitivity in humans have been limited. This study examined the hypothesis that adolescents with substance use disorder show altered interoceptive processing, measured by stimulating mechano-receptive C-fibers (MR-CF) via soft touch. Adolescents with substance use disorders (SUD, n=15) and comparison youth (CON, n=17) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during anticipation or reception of a positively valenced ""Soft Touch"" consisting of MR-CF stimulation to the palm or forearm. Visual analog scales (VAS) indexed subjective interoceptive experience (e.g., pleasantness, intensity). Across all conditions, SUD displayed attenuated left posterior insula activation compared to CON. Greater left anterior insula and right lentiform nucleus activation was evident during the application of soft touch for SUD but not for CON. Whereas for CON, greater left anterior insula activation was associated with higher pleasantness ratings, pleasantness was linked to less anterior insula activation in SUD. Finally, within SUD, attenuated posterior insula activation was related to more recent cannabis use. SUD adolescents exhibit blunted somatovisceral processing of pleasant stimulation, heightened sensitivity in regions responsible for processing reward value, and altered relationships between interoceptive processing and subjective experience.

social interaction","The disposition for prosocial conduct, which contributes to cooperation as arising during social interaction, requires cortical network dynamics responsive to the development of social ties, or care about the interests of specific interaction partners. Here, we formulate a dynamic computational model that accurately predicted how tie formation, driven by the interaction history, influences decisions to contribute in a public good game. We used model-driven functional MRI to test the hypothesis that brain regions key to social interactions keep track of dynamics in tie strength. Activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex tracked the individual's public good contributions. Activation in the bilateral posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), and temporo-parietal junction was modulated parametrically by the dynamically developing social tie-as estimated by our model-supporting a role of these regions in social tie formation. Activity in these two regions further reflected inter-individual differences in tie persistence and sensitivity to behavior of the interaction partner. Functional connectivity between pSTS and mPFC activations indicated that the representation of social ties is integrated in the decision process. These data reveal the brain mechanisms underlying the integration of interaction dynamics into a social tie representation which in turn influenced the individual's prosocial decisions. ",
pmid_22397907,Influence of emotional distraction on working memory performance in borderline personality disorder.,,"Emotion dysregulation, characterized by heightened emotional arousal and increased emotional sensitivity, is a core feature of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Although current theories emphasize the disruptive potential of negative emotions on cognitive functioning in BPD, behavioral and neurobiological data on this relationship are still lacking. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), neural activity was investigated in 22 unmedicated BPD patients and 22 healthy participants (matched for age, education and intelligence) performing an adapted Sternberg working memory task, while being distracted by emotional (negatively arousing) and neutral pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Emotional distraction was associated with significantly higher activation in the amygdala and decreased activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), extending findings of previous studies in healthy individuals. Patients with BPD showed significantly longer reaction times (RTs) along with significantly higher activation in the amygdala and insula during emotional distraction compared to healthy participants, suggesting that they were more distracted by emotional pictures during the working memory task. Moreover, in the group of BPD patients, a significant negative correlation was found between activation in limbic brain regions and self-reports of current dissociative states. Our findings suggest hyper-responsiveness to emotionally distracting pictures in BPD patients that negatively affects working memory performance. This stresses the importance of emotion dysregulation in the context of cognitive functioning. Moreover, our findings suggest that dissociative states have a dampening effect on neural reactivity during emotional challenge in BPD. ",
pmid_17487272,FMRI reveals a dissociation between grasping and perceiving the size of real 3D objects.,,"Almost 15 years after its formulation, evidence for the neuro-functional dissociation between a dorsal action stream and a ventral perception stream in the human cerebral cortex is still based largely on neuropsychological case studies. To date, there is no unequivocal evidence for separate visual computations of object features for performance of goal-directed actions versus perceptual tasks in the neurologically intact human brain. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to test explicitly whether or not brain areas mediating size computation for grasping are distinct from those mediating size computation for perception. Subjects were presented with the same real graspable 3D objects and were required to perform a number of different tasks: grasping, reaching, size discrimination, pattern discrimination or passive viewing. As in prior studies, the anterior intraparietal area (AIP) in the dorsal stream was more active during grasping, when object size was relevant for planning the grasp, than during reaching, when object properties were irrelevant for movement planning (grasping>reaching). Activity in AIP showed no modulation, however, when size was computed in the context of a purely perceptual task (size = pattern discrimination). Conversely, the lateral occipital (LO) cortex in the ventral stream was modulated when size was computed for perception (size>pattern discrimination) but not for action (grasping = reaching). While areas in both the dorsal and ventral streams responded to the simple presentation of 3D objects (passive viewing), these areas were differentially activated depending on whether the task was grasping or perceptual discrimination, respectively. The demonstration of dual coding of an object for the purposes of action on the one hand and perception on the other in the same healthy brains offers a substantial contribution to the current debate about the nature of the neural coding that takes place in the dorsal and ventral streams. ",
pmid_15961049,Familiarity enhances invariance of face representations in human ventral visual cortex: fMRI evidence.,,"Face recognition across different viewing conditions is strongly improved by familiarity. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the neural basis of this effect is a less view-dependent representation of familiar faces in ventral visual cortex by assessing priming-related fMRI repetition effects. 15 healthy volunteers made male/female judgements on familiar (famous) and unfamiliar (novel) faces preceded by the same image, a different image of the same face, or another (unprimed) face. Reaction times revealed priming by same and different images independent of familiarity and more pronounced for same than different images. In the imaging data, a main effect of prime condition was found in bilateral fusiform and orbitofrontal regions. A right anterior fusiform region expressed stronger response decreases to repetition of familiar than unfamiliar faces. Bilateral mid-fusiform areas showed stronger response decreases to repetition of same than different images. A regions-of-interest analysis focussing specifically on face responsive regions suggested differences in the degree of image dependency across fusiform cortex. Collapsing across familiarity, there was greater image dependency of repetition effects in right than left anterior fusiform, replicating previous imaging findings obtained with common objects. For familiar faces alone, there was greater generalisation of repetition effects over different images in anterior than middle fusiform. This suggests a role of anterior fusiform cortex in coding image-independent representations of familiar faces. ",

An fMRI study.,,"To assess the effect of caffeine on the functional MRI signal during a 2-back verbal working memory task, we examined blood oxygenation level-dependent regional brain activity in 15 healthy right-handed males. The subjects, all moderate caffeine consumers, underwent two scanning sessions on a 1.5-T MR-Scanner separated by a 24- to 48-h interval. Each participant received either placebo or 100 mg caffeine 20 min prior to the performance of the working memory task in blinded crossover fashion. The study was implemented as a blocked-design. Analysis was performed using SPM2. In both conditions, the characteristic working memory network of frontoparietal cortical activation including the precuneus and the anterior cingulate could be shown. In comparison to placebo, caffeine caused an increased response in the bilateral medial frontopolar cortex (BA 10), extending to the right anterior cingulate cortex (BA 32). These results suggest that caffeine modulates neuronal activity as evidenced by fMRI signal changes in a network of brain areas associated with executive and attentional functions during working memory processes.

working memory","The majority of neuroimaging studies focus on brain activity during performance of cognitive tasks; however, some studies focus on brain areas that activate in the absence of a task. Despite the surge of research comparing these contrasted areas of brain function, their interrelation is not well understood. We systematically manipulated cognitive load in a working memory task to examine concurrently the relation between activity elicited by the task versus activity during control conditions. We presented adults with six levels of task demand, and compared those with three conditions without a task. Using whole-brain analysis, we found positive linear relations between cortical activity and task difficulty in areas including middle frontal gyrus and dorsal cingulate; negative linear relations were found in medial frontal gyrus and posterior cingulate. These findings demonstrated balancing of activation patterns between two mental processes, which were both modulated by task difficulty. Frontal areas followed a graded pattern more closely than other regions. These data also showed that working memory has limited capacity in adults: an upper bound of seven items and a lower bound of four items. Overall, working memory and default-mode processes, when studied concurrently, reveal mutually competing activation patterns. ",
pmid_19922112,MRI-based functional neuroimaging in ALS: an update.,,"With non-invasive functional imaging techniques, neuroscience has reached a new era of connecting anatomy and function. Although other techniques bear the advantage of either higher temporal or spatial resolution, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is the most widely used non-invasive brain imaging technique. fMRI provides an acceptable balance between low patient load and high information capacity with good spatial resolution, making it ideal for clinical research in patients with physical restrictions like those with ALS. Most fMRI studies have provided evidence of a spatial shift of function in motor and extramotor areas in ALS patients. Furthermore, MRI-based functional imaging has supported the clinical findings of frontal cortical involvement not only in patients with ALS/dementia complex but also in patients with ALS and sub-clinical cognitive impairment. Functional MRI will identify the preserved but non-executable functions in ALS patients in the end stage and will set the direction for a new way of thinking on the functional capacities of these patients which will have a major impact on our way of thinking about end-of-life decisions.

pmid_22139325,Compensatory brain activation in children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder during a simplified Go/No-go task.,,"Given that a number of recent studies have shown attenuated brain activation in prefrontal regions in children with ADHD, it has been recognized as a disorder in executive function. However, fewer studies have focused exclusively on the compensatory brain activation in ADHD. The present study objective was to investigate the compensatory brain activation patterns during response inhibition (RI) processing in ADHD children. In this study, 15 ADHD children and 15 sex-, age-, and IQ-matched control children were scanned with a 3-T MRI equipment while performing a simplified letter Go/No-go task. The results showed more brain activation in the ADHD group compared with the control group, whereas the accuracy and reaction time of behavioral performance were the same. Children with ADHD did not activate the normal RI brain circuits, which are thought to be predominantly located in the right middle/inferior frontal gyrus (BA46/44), right inferior parietal regions (BA40), and pre-SMA(BA6), but instead, activated brain regions, such as the left inferior frontal cortex, the right inferior temporal cortex, the right precentral gyrus, the left postcentral gyrus, the inferior occipital cortex, the middle occipital cortex, the right calcarine, the right hippocampus, the right midbrain, and the cerebellum. Our conclusion is that children with ADHD tend to compensatorily use more posterior and diffusive brain regions to sustain normal RI function. ",

The monetary incentive delay (MID) task can be used to study the response of the ventral striatum to incentive stimuli. We show that activation of the ventral striatum is low in patients with schizophrenia, and that this low activation is related to primary and secondary negative symptoms induced by neuroleptics, also known as antipsychotics. Switching from first-(typical) to second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics increased activation of the ventral striatum due to less blocking of dopamine D2 receptors. This and similar studies show that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks are suitable to investigate important aspects of antipsychotic mechanisms. ",
pmid_28486506,An fMRI study into emotional processing in Parkinson's disease: Does increased medial prefrontal activation compensate for striatal dysfunction?,,"Apart from a progressive decline of motor functions, Parkinson's disease (PD) is also characterized by non-motor symptoms, including disturbed processing of emotions. This study aims at assessing emotional processing and its neurobiological correlates in PD with the focus on how medicated Parkinson patients may achieve normal emotional responsiveness despite basal ganglia dysfunction. Nineteen medicated patients with mild to moderate PD (without dementia or depression) and 19 matched healthy controls passively viewed positive, negative, and neutral pictures in an event-related blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging study (BOLD-fMRI). Individual subjective ratings of valence and arousal levels for these pictures were obtained right after the scanning. Parkinson patients showed similar valence and arousal ratings as controls, denoting intact emotional processing at the behavioral level. Yet, Parkinson patients showed decreased bilateral putaminal activation and increased activation in the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC), compared to controls, both most pronounced for highly arousing emotional stimuli. Our findings revealed for the first time a possible compensatory neural mechanism in Parkinson patients during emotional processing. The increased medial PFC activity may have modulated emotional responsiveness in patients via top-down cognitive control, therewith restoring emotional processing at the behavioral level, despite striatal dysfunction. These results may impact upon current treatment strategies of affective disorders in PD as patients may benefit from this intact or even compensatory influence of prefrontal areas when therapeutic strategies are applied that rely on cognitive control to modulate disturbed processing of emotions.

Granger causality analysis","Many functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have indicated that Granger causality analysis (GCA) is a suitable method for revealing causal effects between brain regions. The purpose of the present study was to identify neuroimaging biomarkers with a high sensitivity to amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). The resting-state fMRI data of 30 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 14 patients with aMCI, and 18 healthy controls (HC) were evaluated using GCA. This study focused on the ""triple networks"" concept, a recently proposed higher-order functioning-related brain network model that includes the default-mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and executive control network (ECN). As expected, GCA techniques were able to reveal differences in connectivity in the three core networks among the three patient groups. The fMRI data were pre-processed using DPARSFA v2.3 and REST v1.8. Voxel-wise GCA was performed using the REST-GCA in the REST toolbox. The directed (excitatory and inhibitory) connectivity obtained from GCA could differentiate among the AD, aMCI and HC groups. This result suggests that analysing the directed connectivity of inter-hemisphere connections represents a sensitive method for revealing connectivity changes observed in patients with aMCI. Specifically, inhibitory within-DMN connectivity from the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) to the hippocampal formation and from the thalamus to the PCC as well as excitatory within-SN connectivity from the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) to the striatum, from the ECN to the DMN, and from the SN to the ECN demonstrated that changes in connectivity likely reflect compensatory effects in aMCI. These findings suggest that changes observed in the triple networks may be used as sensitive neuroimaging biomarkers for the early detection of aMCI. ",

VBCT findings in ADHD children/adolescents revealed reduced cortical thickness in the left superior frontal, left orbito-frontal and left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. VBM findings confirmed decreased gray matter volume in the left orbito frontal, left middle frontal/dorsolateral prefrontal, left middle temporal and left cerebellum in comparison to control group. A decrease in white matter volume was also observed in the left inferior frontal and left calcarine of ADHD children/adolescents.

Inflammation is a pivotal process in the progression of atherosclerosis, which can be noninvasively imaged by FDG positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). Carotid artery wall FDG uptake was quantified in 134 patients (age 60.2 ± 9.7 years; diabetic subjects, n = 43).

Associations between FDG uptake, the presence of risk factors for atherosclerosis, and diabetes were then assessed by multiple regression analysis with backward elimination. The study demonstrated a significant association between diabetes and FDG uptake in the arterial wall (diabetes (mean)SUV(gluc) β = 0.324, (mean)TBR(gluc) β = 0.317, and SHS(gluc) β = 0.298; for all, p < 0.0001). In addition, in diabetic patients, both body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2) ((mean)SUV(gluc) β = 0.4, (mean)TBR(gluc) β = 0.357, and SHS(gluc) β = 0.388; for all, p < 0.015) and smoking ((mean)TBR(gluc), β = 0.312; SHS(gluc), β = 0.324; for all, p < 0.04) were significantly associated with FDG uptake. Type 2 diabetes was significantly associated with carotid wall FDG uptake in patients with known or suspected cardiovascular disease. In diabetic patients, obesity and smoking add to the risk of increased FDG uptake values. ",
pmid_19320552,Processing of the incentive for social approval in the ventral striatum during charitable donation.,,"Human behaviors are motivated not only by materialistic rewards but also by abstract social rewards, such as the approval of others. When choosing an action in social situations, to evaluate each action, the brain must convert different types of reward (such as money or social approval) into a common scale. Here using fMRI, we investigated the neural correlates of such valuation computations while individuals freely decided whether to donate to real charities or to take the money for themselves in the presence or absence of observers. Behavioral evidence showed that the mere presence of observers increased donation rates, and neuroimaging results revealed that activation in the ventral striatum before the same choice (""donate"" or ""not donate"") was significantly modulated by the presence of observers. Particularly high striatal activations were observed when a high social reward was expected (donation in public) and when there was the potential for monetary gain without social cost (no donation in the absence of observers). These findings highlight the importance of this area in representing both social and monetary rewards as a ""decision utility"" and add to the understanding of how the brain makes a choice using a ""common neural currency"" in social situations.

pmid_15592463,Morphing Marilyn into Maggie dissociates physical and identity face representations in the brain.,,"How the brain represents different aspects of faces remains controversial. Here we presented subjects with stimuli drawn from morph continua between pairs of famous faces. In the paired presentations, a second face could be identical to the first, could share perceived identity but differ physically (30% along the morph continuum), or could differ physically by the same distance along the continuum (30%) but in the other direction. We show that, behaviorally, subjects are more likely to classify face pairs in the third paired presentation as different and that this effect is more pronounced for subjects who are more familiar with the faces. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), inferior occipital gyrus (IOG) shows sensitivity to physical rather than to identity changes, whereas right fusiform gyrus (FFG) shows sensitivity to identity rather than to physical changes. Bilateral anterior temporal regions show sensitivity to identity change that varies with the subjects' pre-experimental familiarity with the faces. These findings provide neurobiological support for a hierarchical model of face perception. ",
pmid_22691615,Persistent affective biases in human amygdala response following implicit priming with negative emotion concepts.,,"To what extent do past experiences shape our behaviors, perceptions, and thoughts even without explicit knowledge of these influences? Behavioral research has demonstrated that various cognitive processes can be influenced by conceptual representations implicitly primed during a preceding and unrelated task. Here we investigated whether emotion processing might also be influenced by prior incidental exposure to negative semantic material and which neural substrates would mediate these effects. During a first (priming) task, participants performed a variant of the hangman game with either negative or neutral emotion-laden words. Subsequently, they performed a second, unrelated visual task with fearful and neutral faces presented at attended or unattended locations. Participants were generally not aware of any relationships between the two tasks. We found that priming with emotional words enhanced amygdala sensitivity to faces in the subsequent visual task, while decreasing discriminative responses to threat. Furthermore, the magnitude of the induced bias in behavior and amygdala activation was predicted by the effectiveness of semantic access observed in the priming task. This demonstrates that emotional processing can be modulated by implicit influence of environmental information processed at an earlier time, independently of volitional control. ",
pmid_33667416,Alzheimer's disease.,,"In this Seminar, we highlight the main developments in the field of Alzheimer's disease. The most recent data indicate that, by 2050, the prevalence of dementia will double in Europe and triple worldwide, and that estimate is 3 times higher when based on a biological (rather than clinical) definition of Alzheimer's disease. The earliest phase of Alzheimer's disease (cellular phase) happens in parallel with accumulating amyloid β, inducing the spread of tau pathology. The risk of Alzheimer's disease is 60-80% dependent on heritable factors, with more than 40 Alzheimer's disease-associated genetic risk loci already identified, of which the APOE alleles have the strongest association with the disease. Novel biomarkers include PET scans and plasma assays for amyloid β and phosphorylated tau, which show great promise for clinical and research use. Multidomain lifestyle-based prevention trials suggest cognitive benefits in participants with increased risk of dementia. Lifestyle factors do not directly affect Alzheimer's disease pathology, but can still contribute to a positive outcome in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Promising pharmacological treatments are poised at advanced stages of clinical trials and include anti-amyloid β, anti-tau, and anti-inflammatory strategies. ",
pmid_15040547,Neuroimaging studies of working memory: a meta-analysis.,,"We performed meta-analyses on 60 neuroimaging (PET and fMRI) studies of working memory (WM), considering three types of storage material (spatial, verbal, and object), three types of executive function (continuous updating of WM, memory for temporal order, and manipulation of information in WM), and interactions between material and executive function. Analyses of material type showed the expected dorsal-ventral dissociation between spatial and nonspatial storage in the posterior cortex, but not in the frontal cortex. Some support was found for left frontal dominance in verbal WM, but only for tasks with low executive demand. Executive demand increased right lateralization in the frontal cortex for spatial WM. Tasks requiring executive processing generally produce more dorsal frontal activations than do storage-only tasks, but not all executive processes show this pattern. Brodmann's areas (BAs) 6, 8, and 9, in the superior frontal cortex, respond most when WM must be continuously updated and when memory for temporal order must be maintained. Right BAs 10 and 47, in the ventral frontal cortex, respond more frequently with demand for manipulation (including dual-task requirements or mental operations). BA 7, in the posterior parietal cortex, is involved in all types of executive function. Finally, we consider a potential fourth executive function: selective attention to features of a stimulus to be stored in WM, which leads to increased probability of activating the medial prefrontal cortex (BA 32) in storage tasks. ",
pmid_11467917,A temporoparietal and prefrontal network for retrieving the spatial context of lifelike events.,,"Virtual reality (VR) and event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging were used to study memory for the spatial context of controlled but lifelike events. Subjects received a set of objects from two different people in two different places within a VR environment. Memory for the objects, and for where and from whom they were received was tested by putting the subject back into a place in the company of a person and giving a paired forced choice of objects. In four conditions objects had to be chosen according to different criteria: which was received in that place, which was received from that person, which object was recognized, and which object was widest. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed during testing to identify areas involved in retrieval of the spatial context of an event. A network of areas was identified consisting of a temporoparietal pathway running between the precuneus and parahippocampi via retrosplenial cortex and the parieto-occipital sulcus, left hippocampus, bilateral posterior parietal, dorsolateral, ventrolateral and anterior prefrontal cortices, and the anterior cingulate. Of these areas the parahippocampal, right posterior parietal, and posteriodorsal medial parietal areas were specifically involved in retrieval of spatial context compared to retrieval of nonspatial context. The posterior activations are consistent with a model of long-term storage of allocentric representations in medial temporal regions with translation to body-centered and head-centered representations computed in right posterior parietal cortex and buffered in the temporoparietal pathway so as to provide an imageable representation in the precuneus. Prefrontal activations are consistent with strategic retrieval processes, including those required to overcome the interference between the highly similar events. ",

recreational Internet gaming user","Although Internet games have been proven to be addictive, only a few game players develop online gaming addiction. A large number of players play online games recreationally without being addicted to it. These individuals are defined as recreational Internet gaming users (RGU). So far, no research has investigated decision-making and impulse control in RGU. In the current study, we used delay discounting (DD) task and probabilistic discounting (PD) task to examine decision-making and impulse control in 20 healthy controls, 20 subjects with Internet gaming disorder (IGD) and 23 RGU during fMRI scanning. At the behavioral level, RGU showed lower DD rate and higher PD rate than subjects with IGD and there was no significant difference between RGU and healthy controls on the DD and PD rates. At the neural level, RGU showed increased neural response in the parahippocampal gyrus, the anterior cingulate cortex, the medial frontal gyrus and the inferior frontal gyrus as compared with subjects with IGD. These brain regions may play an important role in preventing RGU from developing addiction. The results suggest that the RGU are capable of inhibiting impulse due to additional cognitive endeavor and the subjects with IGD have deficit in decision-making and impulsive control, which are associated with brain dysfunction.

pmid_21601434,Fronto-striatal underactivation during interference inhibition and attention allocation in grown up children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and persistent symptoms.,,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in medication-naïve children has been associated with reduced activation in inferior/medial prefrontal, striatal and parieto-temporal cortices during inhibitory control and attention allocation. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in adult ADHD, however, have been inconsistent and confounded by medication-history and the need for a retrospective diagnosis of childhood ADHD. We used fMRI combined with a Simon task that measured interference inhibition and controlled for and co-measured attention allocation to compare brain function in 11 medication-naïve adults with persistent inattentive/hyperactive behaviours, followed up from childhood ADHD, and 15 age-matched controls. Despite comparable task performance, patients showed reduced activation compared to controls in left orbital/medial frontal cortex and striatum during interference inhibition and in left lateral inferior/dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during attention allocation. Whole-brain regression analyses within patients showed a negative correlation between symptom severity and fronto-striatal, temporo-parietal and cerebellar brain activation. The findings demonstrate that the typical fronto-striatal dysfunction observed in children with ADHD during interference inhibition and attention allocation is also observed in adults grown up from childhood ADHD with persistent symptoms. Furthermore, they show that functional deficits in adult ADHD are not related to chronic stimulant medication given that this sample was medication-naive. ",
pmid_22392009,Behavioural treatment increases activity in the cognitive neuronal networks in children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.,,"Response cost and token approach (RCT) within the scope of a summer camp training is an effective treatment program for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is likely that intensive RCT training influences networks responsible for ADHD symptoms. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was carried out in 12 children with ADHD before and after the RCT program and in 12 healthy control children twice. For fMRI, a Go/No-go paradigm was used to investigate the influence of RCT training on attention and impulsivity. The No-go condition revealed only weak activation in the dorsal part of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), parietal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) before the training in children with ADHD compared to healthy children. However, this activation in these brain regions was significantly more pronounced after the training. This increase in hemodynamic response cannot be attributed merely to repetition of the measurement since the effect was not observed in healthy children. The increase in hemodynamic response in the ACC and right DLPFC was significantly associated with a reduction in response time variability and clinical symptoms in ADHD patients. After the RCT training, the children with ADHD demonstrated more pronounced activation of cortical structures which are typically related to response monitoring and self-control. It seems likely that children with ADHD learned more cognitive control in a continuous performance task as was revealed by both neuropsychological outcome and fMRI. ",
pmid_23025352,Functional imaging studies of emotion regulation: a synthetic review and evolving model of the cognitive control of emotion.,,"This paper reviews and synthesizes functional imaging research that over the past decade has begun to offer new insights into the brain mechanisms underlying emotion regulation. Toward that end, the first section of the paper outlines a model of the processes and neural systems involved in emotion generation and regulation. The second section surveys recent research supporting and elaborating the model, focusing primarily on studies of the most commonly investigated strategy, which is known as reappraisal. At its core, the model specifies how prefrontal and cingulate control systems modulate activity in perceptual, semantic, and affect systems as a function of one's regulatory goals, tactics, and the nature of the stimuli and emotions being regulated. This section also shows how the model can be generalized to understand the brain mechanisms underlying other emotion regulation strategies as well as a range of other allied phenomena. The third and last section considers directions for future research, including how basic models of emotion regulation can be translated to understand changes in emotion across the life span and in clinical disorders.

Group cognitive–behavioral therapy
Resting-state","Amygdala is considered as the core pathogenesis of generalized social anxiety disorder (GSAD). However, it is still unclear whether effective group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) could modulate the function of amygdala-related network. We aimed to examine the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the amygdala before and after group CBT. Fifteen patients with GSAD were scanned on a 3T MR system before and after 8 weeks of group CBT. For comparison, nineteen healthy control participants also underwent baseline fMRI scanning. We used bilateral amygdala as seed regions and the rsFC maps of the right and left amygdala were created separately in a voxel-wise way. Clusters survived two-tailed Gaussian Random Field (GRF) correction at p <0.05 (voxel z value >2.3). Compared with baseline, patients with CBT showed significantly decreased connectivity of the left amygdala with the right putamen, the left dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Especially, the changes of the connectivity between the left amygdala and the dACC positively correlated with changes of the anxiety symptom in patients. Furthermore, in relative to controls, patients showed higher connectivity of left amygdala with dmPFC and dACC at baseline, while normal after CBT. Short-term group CBT could down-regulate the abnormal higher connectivity of prefrontal-amygdala network, along with clinical improvement. This may provide a potential biomarker to monitor the treatment effect of CBT in GSAD patients. ",
pmid_24390655,Differences in functional activity between boys with pure oppositional defiant disorder and controls during a response inhibition task: a preliminary study.,,"Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) of inhibitory control has only been investigated in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder (CD). The objective of this study was to investigate the differences of functional areas associated with inhibitory control between boys with pure oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and controls during a response inhibition task using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Eleven boys with pure ODD and ten control boys, aged 10 to 12, performed a GoStop response inhibition task in this study. The task has a series of ""go"" trials to establish a pre-potent response tendency and a number of ""stop"" trials to test subjects' ability to withhold their responses. During the GoStop task, greater activation in the dorsolateral parts of the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus (lMFG) and right superior frontal gyrus (rSFG) activation was seen in the ODD boys. Additionally, reduced activation in regions of the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) was seen in the ODD boys in comparison with the control group. The results may suggest that the higher activation in areas adjacent to the rIFG could be the cause of reduced activation in the rIFG; although this is speculative and requires additional supporting evidence. The findings further suggest that ODD is a less pronounced functional disorder compared to ADHD and CD. ",
pmid_21338650,Disrupted regional homogeneity in treatment-resistant depression: a resting-state fMRI study.,,"Using a newly developed regional homogeneity (ReHo) approach, we were to explore the features of brain activity in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in resting state, and further to examine the relationship between abnormal brain activity in TRD patients and specific symptom factors derived from ratings on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). 24 patients with TRD and 19 gender-, age-, and education-matched healthy subjects participated in the fMRI scans. 1. Compared with healthy controls, decreased ReHo were found in TRD patients in the left insula, superior temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, lingual gyrus and cerebellumanterior lobe (culmen) (p<0.05, corrected). 2. Compared with healthy controls, increased ReHo were found in the left superior temporal gyrus, cerebellum posterior lobe (tuber), cerebellum anterior lobe (culmen), the right cerebellar tonsil and bilateral fusiform gyrus (p<0.05, corrected). 3. There was no correlation between the ReHo values in any brain region detected in our study and the patients' age, years of education, illness duration, HRSD total score and its symptom factors. The influence of antidepressants to the brain activity in TRD patients was not fully eliminated. The pathogenesis of TRD may be attributed to abnormal neural activity in multiple brain regions. ",
pmid_17047671,Brain morphometry and cognitive performance in detoxified alcohol-dependents with preserved psychosocial functioning.,,"The extent of structural brain damage and related cognitive deficits has been little described in alcohol-dependent individuals with preserved social functioning. Thus, we investigated the relationship between regional alterations, executive performance, and drinking history. Volumes of gray and white matter were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging voxel-based morphometry in healthy men and in detoxified alcohol-dependent men with good psychosocial functioning. Their executive performance was assessed using neuropsychological tests. Regression analyses were carried out in the regions in which volume differences were detected. Decreases in gray matter were detected bilaterally in alcohol-dependents in the dorsolateral frontal cortex (up to 20% lower), and to a lesser extent in the temporal cortex, insula, thalamus, and cerebellum. Decreases in white matter volume were widespread, being up to 10% in corpus callosum. The degradation of neuropsychological performance correlated with gray matter volume decreases in the frontal lobe, insula, hippocampus, thalami and cerebellum, and with white matter decrease in the brainstem. An early age at first drinking was associated with decreased gray matter volumes in the cerebellum, brainstem (pons), and frontal regions. Regional alteration in gray and white matter volume was associated with impairment of executive function despite preserved social and somatic functioning in detoxified patients. Besides involving frontal regions, these findings are consistent with a cerebello-thalamo-cortical model of impaired executive functions in alcohol-dependent individuals. ",
pmid_19015077,Brain mechanisms of persuasion: how 'expert power' modulates memory and attitudes.,,"Human behaviour is affected by various forms of persuasion. The general persuasive effect of high expertise of the communicator, often referred to as 'expert power', is well documented. We found that a single exposure to a combination of an expert and an object leads to a long-lasting positive effect on memory for and attitude towards the object. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we probed the neural processes predicting these behavioural effects. Expert context was associated with distributed left-lateralized brain activity in prefrontal and temporal cortices related to active semantic elaboration. Furthermore, experts enhanced subsequent memory effects in the medial temporal lobe (i.e. in hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus) involved in memory formation. Experts also affected subsequent attitude effects in the caudate nucleus involved in trustful behaviour, reward processing and learning. These results may suggest that the persuasive effect of experts is mediated by modulation of caudate activity resulting in a re-evaluation of the object in terms of its perceived value. Results extend our view of the functional role of the dorsal striatum in social interaction and enable us to make the first steps toward a neuroscientific model of persuasion. ",

Vocabulary learning
Working memory","Previous research has shown a systematic relationship between phonological working memory capacity and second language proficiency for alphabetic languages. However, little is known about the impact of working memory processes on second language learning in a non-alphabetic language such as Mandarin Chinese. Due to the greater complexity of the Chinese writing system we expect that visual working memory rather than phonological working memory exerts a unique influence on learning Chinese characters. This issue was explored in the present experiment by comparing visual working memory training with an active (auditory working memory training) control condition and a passive, no training control condition. Training induced modulations in language-related brain networks were additionally examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging in a pretest-training-posttest design. As revealed by pre- to posttest comparisons and analyses of individual differences in working memory training gains, visual working memory training led to positive transfer effects on visual Chinese vocabulary learning compared to both control conditions. In addition, we found sustained activation after visual working memory training in the (predominantly visual) left infero-temporal cortex that was associated with behavioral transfer. In the control conditions, activation either increased (active control condition) or decreased (passive control condition) without reliable behavioral transfer effects. This suggests that visual working memory training leads to more efficient processing and more refined responses in brain regions involved in visual processing. Furthermore, visual working memory training boosted additional activation in the precuneus, presumably reflecting mental image generation of the learned characters. We, therefore, suggest that the conjoint activity of the mid-fusiform gyrus and the precuneus after visual working memory training reflects an interaction of working memory and imagery processes with complex visual stimuli that fosters the coherent synthesis of a percept from a complex visual input in service of enhanced Chinese character learning.

Thus, understanding the test-retest reliability of BOLD signal contrasts from these tasks is important. To evaluate test-retest reliability of responses in reward-related brain regions to food receipt paradigms (palatable tastes, anticipated palatable tastes), food picture paradigms (high-calorie food pictures), a monetary reward paradigm (winning money and anticipating winning money), and a thin female model picture paradigm (thin female model pictures). We conducted secondary univariate contrast-based analyses in data drawn from 4 repeated-measures fMRI studies. Participants (Study 1: N = 60, mean [M] age = 15.2 ± 1.1 y; Study 2: N = 109, M age = 15.1 ± 0.9 y; Study 3: N = 39, M age = 21.2 ± 3.7 y; Study 4: N = 62, M age = 29.7 ± 6.2 y) completed the same tasks over 3-wk to 3-y test-retest intervals. Studies 3 and 4 included participants with eating disorders and obesity, respectively. Test-retest reliability of the food receipt and food picture paradigms was poor, with average ICC values ranging from 0.07 to 0.20. The monetary reward paradigm and the thin female model picture paradigm also showed poor test-retest reliability: average ICC values 0.21 and 0.12, respectively. Although several regions demonstrated moderate to good test-retest reliability, these results did not replicate across studies using similar paradigms. In Studies 3 and 4, but not Study 1, test-retest reliability in visual processing regions was moderate to good when contrasting single conditions with a low-level baseline. Results underscore the importance of examining the temporal reliability of fMRI tasks and call for the development and use of well-validated standardized fMRI tasks in eating- and obesity-related studies that can provide more reliable measures of neural activation. The trials were registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02084836, NCT01949636, NCT03261050, and NCT03375853. ",

Clinical, demographical, and methodological heterogeneity may contribute to the inconsistency. Forty-four patients with first-episode, drug-naive schizophrenia, 42 unaffected siblings of schizophrenia patients and 44 healthy controls took part in this study. Global-brain FC (GFC) was employed to analyze the imaging data. Compared with healthy controls, patients with schizophrenia and unaffected siblings shared enhanced GFC in the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG). In addition, patients had increased GFC mainly in the thalamo-cortical network, including the bilateral thalamus, bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus, left superior medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), right angular gyrus, and right SFG/middle frontal gyrus and decreased GFC in the left ITG/cerebellum Crus I. No other altered GFC values were observed in the siblings group relative to the control group. Further ROC analysis showed that increased GFC in the left SFG could separate the patients or the siblings from the controls with acceptable sensitivities. Our findings suggest that increased GFC in the left SFG may serve as a potential endophenotype for schizophrenia. ",

In healthy participants, episodic future thinking has been shown to reduce impulsivity during intertemporal choice. Here, we examine for the first time a modulation of temporal discounting via episodic future thinking in a group of pathological gamblers. We investigated a sample of 24 pathological gamblers and 24 matched healthy controls with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants made intertemporal choices in two experimental conditions. In the control condition, delayed monetary rewards were offered with the respective amount and delay. In the episodic condition, rewards were additionally associated with participant-specific personal future events. We replicated previous findings of increased temporal discounting in pathological gambling. On a trend level, episodic future thinking attenuated discounting across all participants. We found that pathological gamblers could successfully recruit a prospection related network during decision-making in the presence of episodic information. The episodic condition modulated the functional connection between ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and ventral striatum, a mechanism that might support the increase in striatal value coding observed in the episodic condition in gamblers. However, in controls, but not in gamblers, valuation signal changes in the hippocampus were associated with less impulsive behavior. We provide first evidence that by episodic cues during intertemporal decision-making striatal valuation signals can be enhanced in pathological gamblers. Further research is needed to explore interventions that reliably reduce impulsive choice behavior in pathological gambling. ",

However, little is known about users' neural reactivity to emotional nondrug-related stimuli and the potential influence of gender. Test the hypotheses that cocaine-dependent individuals have an attenuated neural response to arousing stimuli relative to controls and that this difference is amplified in women. The brain response to typically arousing positive and negative images as well as neutral images from the International Affective Picture System was measured in 40 individuals (20 non-treatment seeking cocaine-dependent and 20 age- and gender-matched control participants; 50% of whom were women). Images were displayed for 4 s each in blocks of five across two 270-second runs. General linear models assessed within and between group activation differences for the emotional images. Cocaine-dependent individuals had a significantly lower response to typically arousing positive and negative images than controls, with attenuated neural activity present in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Analyses by gender revealed less mPFC/ACC activation among female users, but not males, for both positive and negative images. The dampened neural response to typically arousing stimuli among cocaine-dependent polydrug users suggests decreased salience processing for nondrug stimuli, particularly among female users. This decreased responding is consistent with data from other substance using populations and suggests that this may be a general feature of addiction. Amplifying the neural response to naturally arousing nondrug-related reinforcers may present an opportunity for unique behavioral and brain stimulation therapies. ",
pmid_30022099,Cognitive decline and dementia in diabetes mellitus: mechanisms and clinical implications.,,"Cognitive dysfunction is increasingly recognized as an important comorbidity of diabetes mellitus. Different stages of diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction exist, each with different cognitive features, affected age groups and prognoses and probably with different underlying mechanisms. Relatively subtle, slowly progressive cognitive decrements occur in all age groups. More severe stages, particularly mild cognitive impairment and dementia, with progressive deficits, occur primarily in older individuals (>65 years of age). Patients in the latter group are the most relevant for patient management and are the focus of this Review. Here, we review the evolving insights from studies on risk factors, brain imaging and neuropathology, which provide important clues on mechanisms of both the subtle cognitive decrements and the more severe stages of cognitive dysfunction. In the majority of patients, the cognitive phenotype is probably defined by multiple aetiologies. Although both the risk of clinically diagnosed Alzheimer disease and that of vascular dementia is increased in association with diabetes, the cerebral burden of the prototypical pathologies of Alzheimer disease (such as neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques) is not. A major challenge for researchers is to pinpoint from the spectrum of diabetes-related disease processes those that affect the brain and contribute to development of dementia beyond the pathologies of Alzheimer disease. Observations from experimental models can help to meet that challenge, but this requires further improving the synergy between experimental and clinical scientists. The development of targeted treatment and preventive strategies will therefore depend on these translational efforts. ",
pmid_24781521,Compromised frontocerebellar circuitry contributes to nonplanning impulsivity in recovering alcoholics.,,"Degradation of frontocerebellar circuitry is a principal neural mechanism of alcoholism-related executive dysfunctions affecting impulse control and cognitive planning. We tested the hypothesis that alcoholic patients would demonstrate compromised dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) -cerebellar functional connectivity when adjusting their strategies to accommodate uncertain conditions and would recruit compensatory brain regions to overcome ineffective response patterns. Twenty-six alcoholics and 26 healthy participants underwent functional MRI in two sequential runs while performing a decision-making task. The first run required a response regardless of level of ambiguity of the stimuli; the second run allowed a PASS option (i.e., no response choice), which was useful on ambiguous trials. Healthy controls demonstrated strong synchronous activity between the dACC and cerebellum while planning and executing a behavioral strategy. By contrast, alcoholics showed synchronous activity between the dACC and the premotor cortex, perhaps enabling successful compensation for accuracy and reaction time in certain conditions; however, a negative outcome of this strategy was rigidity in modifying response strategy to accommodate uncertain conditions. Compared with the alcoholic group, the control group had lower nonplanning impulsiveness, which correlated with using the option PASS to respond in uncertain conditions. These findings suggest that compromised dACC-cerebellar functional circuitry contributes to recruitment of an alternative network-dACC-premotor cortex- to perform well under low-risk, unambiguous conditions. This compensatory network, however, was inadequate to enable the alcoholics to avert making poor choices in planning and executing an effective behavioral strategy in high-risk, uncertain conditions.

We found: 1) increased KOOS pain subscores (pain reduction) and serum programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) levels in the three exercise groups compared to the control group; 2) decreased resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the DLPFC-supplementary motor area (SMA) and increased rsFC between the DLPFC and anterior cingulate cortex in all exercise groups compared to the control group; 3) significant associations between DLPFC-SMA rsFC with KOOS pain subscores and serum PD-1 levels at baseline; 4) significantly increased grey matter volume in the SMA in the Tai Chi and stationary cycling groups, and a trend toward significant increase in the Baduanjin group compared to the control group; 5) significant DLPFC rsFC differences among different exercise groups; and 6) that baseline DLPFC-SMA rsFC can predict the effect of mind-body exercise on pain improvement in KOA. Our results suggest that different exercises can modulate both common and unique DLPFC (cognitive control) pathways, and altered DLPFC-SMA rsFC is associated with serum biomarker levels. Our findings also highlight the potentials of neuroimaging biomarkers in predicting the therapeutic effect of mind-body exercises on KOA pain. ",

functional connectivity
trait anxiety","Trait anxiety is considered a susceptible factor for stress-related disorders, and is characterized by abnormal brain activity and connectivity in the regions related to emotional processing (e.g., the amygdala). However, only a few studies have examined the static and dynamic changes of functional connectivity in trait anxiety. We compared the resting-state static and dynamic functional connectivity (sFC/dFC) in individuals with high trait anxiety (HTA, n = 257) and low trait anxiety (LTA, n = 264) using bilateral amygdala subregions as the seeds, that is, the centromedial amygdala (CMA), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and superficial amygdala (SFA). The CMA, BLA, and SFA all showed reduced sFC with the executive control network (ECN) and anomalous dFC with the default mode network (DMN) in individuals with HTA. The CMA only showed reduced sFC with the ECN and reduced dFC with the DMN in individuals with HTA. The BLA showed reduced sFC with the salience network (mainly in the anterior and median cingulate), and increased dFC between the BLA and the DMN in individuals with HTA compared to those with LTA. Notably, HTA showed widespread anomalous functional connectivity in the SFA, including the visual network, mainly in the calcarine fissure, limbic system (olfactory cortex), and basal ganglia (putamen). The anomalous sFC and dFC in individuals with HTA may reflect altered mechanisms in prefrontal control, salient stimuli processing, and amygdaloidal responsivity to potential threats, leading to alterations in associative, attentional, interpretative, and regulating processes that sustain a threat-related processing bias in HTA individuals.

pmid_14728923,Neural processing of nouns and verbs: the role of inflectional morphology.,,"Dissociations of nouns and verbs following brain damage have been interpreted as evidence for distinct neural substrates underlying different aspects of the language system. Some neuroimaging studies have supported this claim by finding neural differentiation for nouns and verbs [Brain 122 (1999) 2337] while others have argued against neural specialisation [Brain 119 (1996) 159; Brain 124 (2001) 1619]. We suggest that one reason why these inconsistencies may have arisen is because the morphological structure of nouns and verbs has been ignored. In an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study we test the hypothesis that the neural processing of nouns and verbs differs when they are inflected. We contrasted the processing of regularly inflected nouns (dogs) with regularly inflected verbs (hitting), and found that the LIFG was more strongly activated in processing regularly inflected verbs compared to regularly inflected nouns. Moreover, regions of LIFG that were more active in the fMRI study for inflected verbs partially overlapped with the lesions in patients who have particular problems with verb morphology. Taken together with previous studies, these results suggest that noun and verb stems do not differ in terms of their representation, but when verbs are morphologically complex they differentially engage those neural systems which are involved in processes of morpho-phonology and syntax.

Treatment outcome","To explore how baseline resting-state cerebral function predicts clinical outcomes of acupuncture treatment for migraine. One hundred migraine patients and 46 healthy subjects were recruited. Patients were randomized into the acupuncture, sham acupuncture, and waiting list groups. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected at baseline and after 1 month of longitudinal acupuncture treatments. Fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) calculations were applied to explore the associations between baseline fALFF and changes in clinical variables in the acupuncture treatment group and the waiting list group. Compared with healthy subjects, migraine patients had lower fALFF in the left rostral ventromedial medulla, right thalamus, left amygdala, and right angular gyrus. Regression analyses revealed that baseline fALFF values in the left middle frontal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus were positively associated with headache intensity changes in the acupuncture treatment group, while baseline fALFF values in the bilateral lingual gyrus and cuneus were negatively associated with headache intensity changes in this group. The baseline fALFF values of brain regions associated with cognitive pain modulation, but not migraine severity, may predict future headache intensity improvement levels in migraine patients receiving acupuncture treatment.

pmid_25799236,Diagnostic classification of schizophrenia patients on the basis of regional reward-related FMRI signal patterns.,,"Functional neuroimaging has provided evidence for altered function of mesolimbic circuits implicated in reward processing, first and foremost the ventral striatum, in patients with schizophrenia. While such findings based on significant group differences in brain activations can provide important insights into the pathomechanisms of mental disorders, the use of neuroimaging results from standard univariate statistical analysis for individual diagnosis has proven difficult. In this proof of concept study, we tested whether the predictive accuracy for the diagnostic classification of schizophrenia patients vs. healthy controls could be improved using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of regional functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation patterns for the anticipation of monetary reward. With a searchlight MVPA approach using support vector machine classification, we found that the diagnostic category could be predicted from local activation patterns in frontal, temporal, occipital and midbrain regions, with a maximal cluster peak classification accuracy of 93% for the right pallidum. Region-of-interest based MVPA for the ventral striatum achieved a maximal cluster peak accuracy of 88%, whereas the classification accuracy on the basis of standard univariate analysis reached only 75%. Moreover, using support vector regression we could additionally predict the severity of negative symptoms from ventral striatal activation patterns. These results show that MVPA can be used to substantially increase the accuracy of diagnostic classification on the basis of task-related fMRI signal patterns in a regionally specific way. ",
pmid_21228154,Predicting individual differences in placebo analgesia: contributions of brain activity during anticipation and pain experience.,,"Recent studies have identified brain correlates of placebo analgesia, but none have assessed how accurately patterns of brain activity can predict individual differences in placebo responses. We reanalyzed data from two fMRI studies of placebo analgesia (N = 47), using patterns of fMRI activity during the anticipation and experience of pain to predict new subjects' scores on placebo analgesia and placebo-induced changes in pain processing. We used a cross-validated regression procedure, LASSO-PCR, which provided both unbiased estimates of predictive accuracy and interpretable maps of which regions are most important for prediction. Increased anticipatory activity in a frontoparietal network and decreases in a posterior insular/temporal network predicted placebo analgesia. Patterns of anticipatory activity across the cortex predicted a moderate amount of variance in the placebo response (∼12% overall, ∼40% for study 2 alone), which is substantial considering the multiple likely contributing factors. The most predictive regions were those associated with emotional appraisal, rather than cognitive control or pain processing. During pain, decreases in limbic and paralimbic regions most strongly predicted placebo analgesia. Responses within canonical pain-processing regions explained significant variance in placebo analgesia, but the pattern of effects was inconsistent with widespread decreases in nociceptive processing. Together, the findings suggest that engagement of emotional appraisal circuits drives individual variation in placebo analgesia, rather than early suppression of nociceptive processing. This approach provides a framework that will allow prediction accuracy to increase as new studies provide more precise information for future predictive models. ",
pmid_14741672,Modality effects in verbal working memory: differential prefrontal and parietal responses to auditory and visual stimuli.,,"The neural bases of verbal (nonspatial) working memory (VWM) have been primarily examined using visual stimuli. Few studies have investigated the neural bases of VWM using auditory stimuli, and fewer have explored modality differences in VWM. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine similarities and differences between visual VWM (vis-VWM) and auditory VWM (aud-VWM) utilizing identical stimuli and a within-subjects design. Performance levels were similar in the two modalities and there was extensive overlap of activation bilaterally in the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC and VLPFC), intraparietal sulcus, supramarginal gyrus and the basal ganglia. However, a direct statistical comparison revealed significant modality differences: the left posterior parietal cortex, primarily along the intraparietal sulcus, showed greater responses during vis-VWM whereas the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex showed greater responses during aud-VWM. No such differences were observed in the right hemisphere. Other modality differences in VWM were also observed, but they were associated with relative decreases in activation. In particular, we detected bilateral suppression of the superior and middle temporal (auditory) cortex during vis-VWM, and of the occipital (visual) cortex during aud-VWM, thus suggesting that cross-modal inhibitory processes may help to provide preferential access to high-order heteromodal association areas. Taken together, our findings suggest that although similar prefrontal and parietal regions are involved in aud-VWM and vis-VWM, there are important modality differences in the way neural signals are generated, processed and routed during VWM.

pmid_24346135,Behavioral and neuroimaging evidence for overreliance on habit learning in alcohol-dependent patients.,,"Substance dependence is characterized by compulsive drug-taking despite negative consequences. Animal research suggests an underlying imbalance between goal-directed and habitual action control with chronic drug use. However, this imbalance, and its associated neurophysiological mechanisms, has not yet been experimentally investigated in human drug abusers. The aim of the present study therefore was to assess the balance between goal-directed and habit-based learning and its neural correlates in abstinent alcohol-dependent (AD) patients. A total of 31 AD patients and 19 age, gender and education matched healthy controls (HC) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during completion of an instrumental learning task designed to study the balance between goal-directed and habit learning. Task performance and task-related blood oxygen level-dependent activations in the brain were compared between AD patients and healthy matched controls. Findings were additionally associated with duration and severity of alcohol dependence. The results of this study provide evidence for an overreliance on stimulus-response habit learning in AD compared with HC, which was accompanied by decreased engagement of brain areas implicated in goal-directed action (ventromedial prefrontal cortex and anterior putamen) and increased recruitment of brain areas implicated in habit learning (posterior putamen) in AD patients. In conclusion, this is the first human study to provide experimental evidence for a disturbed balance between goal-directed and habitual control by use of an instrumental learning task, and to directly implicate cortical dysfunction to overreliance on inflexible habits in AD patients.

pmid_21809082,Working memory capacity correlates with implicit serial reaction time task performance.,,"We recently reported that visuospatial working memory capacity predicts the rate of explicit motor sequence learning (Bo and Seidler in J Neurophysiol 101:3116-3125, 2009). In the current study, we evaluated relationships between visuospatial and verbal working memory and implicit performance change in the serial reaction time (SRT) task. Participants performed two computerized working memory tasks adapted from change detection working memory assessments, an implicit SRT task, and several neuropsychological tests. We observed significant correlations between visuospatial working memory (VSWM) and verbal working memory (VWM) performance. VSWM, VWM, and card rotation task were each significantly correlated with the rate of reaction time improvement in the SRT task. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that VSWM explained a significant portion of the variance in rate of SRT performance change (exponential fit to the performance curve) across individual participants, and the addition of VWM did not significantly improve the model. These findings suggest that VSWM plays a role in the implicit performance improvement of second-order conditional sequences. ",

However, how whole brain functional connectivity pattern homogeneity and its corresponding functional connectivity changes in patients with migraine without aura is unknown. In the current study, we employed a recently developed whole brain functional connectivity homogeneity (FcHo) method to identify the voxel-wise changes of functional connectivity patterns in 21 patients with migraine without aura and 21 gender and age matched healthy controls. Moreover, resting-state functional connectivity analysis was used to reveal the changes of corresponding functional connectivities. FcHo analyses identified significantly decreased FcHo values in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), thalamus (THA), and left anterior insula (AI) in patients with migraine without aura compared to healthy controls. Functional connectivity analyses further found decreased functional connectivities between PCC and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), between AI and anterior cingulate cortex, and between THA and left precentral gyrus (PCG). The functional connectivities between THA and PCG were negatively correlated with pain intensity. Our findings indicated that whole brain FcHo and connectivity abnormalities of these regions may be associated with functional impairments in pain processing in patients with migraine without aura.

fMRI","Alcohol and cannabis are commonly used by adolescents in the United States. Both alcohol use disorder (AUD) and cannabis use disorder (CUD) have been associated with an increased risk of aggression. One form of aggression seen during retaliation is reactive aggression to social provocation. This study investigated the association between AUD and CUD symptom severity and recruitment of neural regions implicated in retaliation. In this study, 102 youths aged 13-18 years (67 male; 84 in residential care) completed self-report measures of aggression-related constructs and participated in a retaliation task during functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the association between relative severity of AUD/CUD and atypical recruitment of regions implicated in retaliation. AUD Identification Test scores were positively associated with irritability and reactive aggression scores. CUD Identification Test scores were positively associated with callous-unemotional traits and both proactive and reactive aggression scores. In functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses, only AUD Identification Test (not CUD Identification Test) scores were associated with an exaggerated recruitment of regions implicated in retaliation (dorsomedial frontal, anterior insula cortices, caudate, and, to a lesser extent, periaqueductal gray). These data suggest that relative severity of AUD is associated with a disinhibited, exaggerated retaliation response that relates to an increased risk for reactive aggression. Similar findings were not related to severity of CUD. ",
pmid_20534464,Resting-state functional MRI in depression unmasks increased connectivity between networks via the dorsal nexus.,,"To better understand intrinsic brain connections in major depression, we used a neuroimaging technique that measures resting state functional connectivity using functional MRI (fMRI). Three different brain networks--the cognitive control network, default mode network, and affective network--were investigated. Compared with controls, in depressed subjects each of these three networks had increased connectivity to the same bilateral dorsal medial prefrontal cortex region, an area that we term the dorsal nexus. The dorsal nexus demonstrated dramatically increased depression-associated fMRI connectivity with large portions of each of the three networks. The discovery that these regions are linked together through the dorsal nexus provides a potential mechanism to explain how symptoms of major depression thought to arise in distinct networks--decreased ability to focus on cognitive tasks, rumination, excessive self-focus, increased vigilance, and emotional, visceral, and autonomic dysregulation--could occur concurrently and behave synergistically. It suggests that the newly identified dorsal nexus plays a critical role in depressive symptomatology, in effect ""hot wiring"" networks together; it further suggests that reducing increased connectivity of the dorsal nexus presents a potential therapeutic target.

pmid_18413706,Dissociated functional brain abnormalities of inhibition in boys with pure conduct disorder and in boys with pure attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.,,"Inhibitory dysfunction may be a transdiagnostic etiopathophysiology of disruptive behavior disorders. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of inhibitory control has only been investigated in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), including comorbidity with conduct disorder, showing frontal-striatal dysfunction. This study investigates differences and commonalities in functional neural networks mediating inhibitory control between medication-naive adolescents with pure conduct disorder and those with pure ADHD to identify biological markers that distinguish these clinically overlapping disorders. Event-related fMRI was used to compare brain activation of 13 boys with noncomorbid conduct disorder, 20 with noncomorbid ADHD, and 20 normal boys during an individually adjusted tracking stop task that measures the neural substrates of inhibition and stopping failure. During successful inhibition, only patients with ADHD showed reduced activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in relation to comparison subjects and patients with conduct disorder. During inhibition failures compared to go responses, both patient groups shared underactivation in the posterior cingulate gyrus in relation to comparison subjects. Patients with conduct disorder showed reduced activation in bilateral temporal-parietal regions compared to the other groups, which did not differ in this measure. Patients with pure ADHD or pure conduct disorder show qualitative differences in their brain abnormality patterns during inhibitory control. Inhibition-mediating prefrontal regions appear to be specifically reduced in ADHD, whereas posterior temporal-parietal, performance monitoring networks are specifically dysfunctional in conduct disorder. The findings provide pioneering evidence that distinct neurobiological abnormalities may be underlying the overlapping behavioral phenotype of the two disruptive disorders. ",
pmid_20428109,"Prefrontal cortical changes following cognitive training in patients with chronic schizophrenia: effects of practice, generalization, and specificity.",,"Cognitive training is increasingly used in the treatment of schizophrenia, but it remains unknown how this training affects functional neuroanatomy. Practice on specific cognitive tasks generally leads to automaticity and decreased prefrontal cortical activity, yet broad-based cognitive training programs may avoid automaticity and increase prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity. This study used quasi-randomized, placebo-control design and pre/post neuroimaging to examine functional plasticity associated with attention and working memory-focused cognitive training in patients with schizophrenia. Twenty-one participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder split into two demographically and performance matched groups (nine scanned per group) and nine control participants were tested 6-8 weeks apart. Compared with both patient controls and healthy controls, patients receiving cognitive training increased activation significantly more in attention and working memory networks, including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate and frontopolar cortex. The extent to which activity increased in a subset of these regions predicted performance improvements. Although this study was not designed to speak to the efficacy of cognitive training as a treatment, it is the first study to show that such training can increase the ability of patients to activate the PFC regions subserving attention and working memory.

pmid_21888982,Do distinct atypical cortical networks process biological motion information in adults with Autism Spectrum Disorders?,,"Whether people with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) have a specific deficit when processing biological motion has been a topic of much debate. We used psychophysical methods to determine individual behavioural thresholds in a point-light direction discrimination paradigm for a small but carefully matched groups of adults (N=10 per group) with and without ASDs. These thresholds were used to derive individual stimulus levels in an identical fMRI task, with the purpose of equalising task performance across all participants whilst inside the scanner. The results of this investigation show that despite comparable behavioural performance both inside and outside the scanner, the group with ASDs shows a different pattern of BOLD activation from the TD group in response to the same stimulus levels. Furthermore, connectivity analysis suggests that the main differences between the groups are that the TD group utilise a unitary network with information passing from temporal to parietal regions, whilst the ASD group utilise two distinct networks; one utilising motion sensitive areas and another utilising form selective areas. Furthermore, a temporal-parietal link that is present in the TD group is missing in the ASD group. We tentatively propose that these differences may occur due to early dysfunctional connectivity in the brains of people with ASDs, which to some extent is compensated for by rewiring in high functioning adults.

type 2 diabetes mellitus","Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been associated with cognitive impairment. However, its neurological mechanism remains elusive. Combining regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity (FC) analyses, the present study aimed to investigate brain functional alterations in middle-aged T2DM patients, which could provide complementary information for the neural substrates underlying T2DM-associated brain dysfunction. Twenty-five T2DM patients and 25 healthy controls were involved in neuropsychological testing and structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data acquisition. ReHo analysis was conducted to determine the peak coordinates of brain regions with abnormal local brain activity synchronization. Then, the identified brain regions were considered as seeds, and FC between these brain regions and global voxels was computed. Finally, the potential correlations between the imaging indices and neuropsychological data were also explored. Compared with healthy controls, T2DM patients exhibited higher ReHo values in the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG) and lower ReHo in the right fusiform gyrus (FFG), right precentral gyrus (PreCG) and right medial orbit of the superior frontal gyrus (SFG). Considering these areas as seed regions, T2DM patients displayed aberrant FC, mainly in the frontal and parietal lobes. The pattern of FC alterations in T2DM patients was characterized by decreased connectivity and positive to negative or negative to positive converted connectivity. Digital Span Test (DST) forward scores revealed significant correlations with the ReHo values of the right PreCG (ρ = 0.527,  ",
pmid_23265635,Reward processing in adolescents with bipolar I disorder.,,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a debilitating psychiatric condition that commonly begins in adolescence, a developmental period that has been associated with increased reward seeking. Because youth with BD are especially vulnerable to negative risk-taking behaviors, understanding the neural mechanisms by which dysregulated affect interacts with the neurobehavioral processing of reward is clearly important. One way to clarify how manic symptoms evolve in BD is to ""prime"" the affect before presenting rewarding stimuli. The objective of this study was to investigate the neural effects of an affective priming task designed to positively induce mood before reward processing in adolescents with and without BD. Neural activity and behaviors during the anticipation of and response to monetary reward and loss after an affective prime were compared using functional magnetic resonance imaging in 13- to 18-year-old adolescents with a recent onset of BD-I (n = 24) and demographically matched healthy comparison youth (n = 24). Compared with the healthy control youth, youth with BD had speeded reaction times and showed decreased activation in the thalamus and inferior temporal gyrus while anticipating gains after priming but increased activations in the middle frontal gyrus and parietal cortices while anticipating losses after priming. Youth with BD also showed less activation in the inferior parietal lobule, thalamus, and superior frontal gyrus while receiving losses after priming. Aberrant prefrontal and subcortical activations during reward processing suggest mechanisms that may underlie disordered self-awareness during goal pursuit and motivation in BD. Longitudinal studies are needed to examine whether this pattern of neural activation predicts a poorer long-term outcome. ",

The relationships of RS functional connectivity with patient clinical and cognitive status and white matter tract damage (i.e., corticospinal tracts, corpus callosum, and superior longitudinal fasciculus) were investigated. Compared with controls, PLS patients showed an increased functional connectivity within the sensorimotor, frontal, and left frontoparietal networks spanning the pre- and postcentral, medial and dorsal frontal, insular, and superior temporal regions. Patients with more severe physical disability and a more rapid rate of disease progression had increased sensorimotor connectivity values. The increased functional connectivity within the frontal network was associated with executive dysfunction. In addition, higher functional connectivity correlated with greater structural damage to network-specific white matter tracts. This study shows clinically meaningful increased resting state functional connectivity in PLS. ",
pmid_18501639,Face-specific and domain-general characteristics of cortical responses during self-recognition.,,"The ability of visual self-recognition in animals and infants is considered a hallmark of the domain-general cognitive representation of the self, which also underpins higher social ability. Cortical regions activated during self-face recognition in human adults have been accordingly expected to play the domain-general role in self-processing. However, there is no evidence of the involvement of this network in non-face domains. We compared cortical responses during face and name recognition of self, a friend, and an unfamiliar person, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Recognition of the self-face activated the right inferior frontal, precentral, supramarginal, and bilateral ventral occipitotemporal regions, consistent with previous findings, whereas these regions did not show self-specific activation during name recognition. During both face and name recognitions, increased activation for the friend and unfamiliar person than for the self was observed in the bilateral temporoparietal regions, and higher activation for the self and friend than for the unfamiliar person was observed in the medial cortical structures. These results suggest that the role of the self-specific networks during face recognition is not domain-general, but rather face-specific, and that the medial cortical structures, which are also implicated in self-referential processes, are not relevant to self-other distinction during face or name recognition. Instead, the reduced temporoparietal activation is a domain-general characteristic of the cortical response during self-recognition, which may reflect suppression of an automatic preparatory process for social interaction, possibly paralleling the disappearance of social behavior to the mirrored self-image at the emergence of self-recognition in animals and infants. ",
pmid_21482548,Expected value and prediction error abnormalities in depression and schizophrenia.,,"The dopamine system has been linked to anhedonia in depression and both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, but it remains unclear how dopamine dysfunction could mechanistically relate to observed symptoms. There is considerable evidence that phasic dopamine signals encode prediction error (differences between expected and actual outcomes), with reinforcement learning theories being based on prediction error-mediated learning of associations. It has been hypothesized that abnormal encoding of neural prediction error signals could underlie anhedonia in depression and negative symptoms in schizophrenia by disrupting learning and blunting the salience of rewarding events, and contribute to psychotic symptoms by promoting aberrant perceptions and the formation of delusions. To test this, we used model based functional magnetic resonance imaging and an instrumental reward-learning task to investigate the neural correlates of prediction errors and expected-reward values in patients with depression (n=15), patients with schizophrenia (n=14) and healthy controls (n=17). Both patient groups exhibited abnormalities in neural prediction errors, but the spatial pattern of abnormality differed, with the degree of abnormality correlating with syndrome severity. Specifically, reduced prediction errors in the striatum and midbrain were found in depression, with the extent of signal reduction in the bilateral caudate, nucleus accumbens and midbrain correlating with increased anhedonia severity. In schizophrenia, reduced prediction error signals were observed in the caudate, thalamus, insula and amygdala-hippocampal complex, with a trend for reduced prediction errors in the midbrain, and the degree of blunting in the encoding of prediction errors in the insula, amygdala-hippocampal complex and midbrain correlating with increased severity of psychotic symptoms. Schizophrenia was also associated with disruption in the encoding of expected-reward values in the bilateral amygdala-hippocampal complex and parahippocampal gyrus, with the degree of disruption correlating with psychotic symptom severity. Neural signal abnormalities did not correlate with negative symptom severity in schizophrenia. These findings support the suggestion that a disruption in the encoding of prediction error signals contributes to anhedonia symptoms in depression. In schizophrenia, the findings support the postulate of an abnormality in error-dependent updating of inferences and beliefs driving psychotic symptoms. Phasic dopamine abnormalities in depression and schizophrenia are suggested by our observation of prediction error abnormalities in dopamine-rich brain areas, given the evidence for dopamine encoding prediction errors. The findings are consistent with proposals that psychiatric syndromes reflect different disorders of neural valuation and incentive salience formation, which helps bridge the gap between biological and phenomenological levels of understanding.

pmid_21907292,Altered spontaneous activity in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment revealed by Regional Homogeneity.,,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent cause of dementia in the elderly, is characterized by progressive cognitive and intellectual deficits. Most patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are thought to be in a very early stage of AD. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging reflects spontaneous brain activities and/or the endogenous/background neurophysiological process of the human brain. Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) can provide a fast method for mapping regional activity across the whole brain. Little has been previously published about where or how spontaneous activity differs between MCI and AD, although many previous fMRI studies have shown that the activity pattern is altered in MCI/AD. In the present study, we first used the ReHo method to explore differences in regional spontaneous activities throughout the whole brain between normal controls (NC) and people with MCI and with AD. A one-way ANOVA was performed to determine the regions in which the ReHo differs between the three groups, and then a post hoc analysis was performed to evaluate differences in the pattern among the three groups. Finally a correlation analysis was done between the ReHo index of these regions and clinical variables in order to evaluate the relationship between ReHo and cognitive measures in the AD and MCI groups. An exploratory classification analysis also demonstrated that ReHo measures were able to correctly separate subjects in 71.4% of the cases. Altered brain spontaneous activations were found in the medial prefrontal cortex, the bilateral posterior cingulate gyrus/precuneus and the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in both MCI and AD. In MCI, the ReHo index in the left IPL was higher than that of the NC, which could indicate the presence of a compensatory mechanism in MCI. More obviously, the correlation analysis indicated that the lower the memory and other cognitive abilities, the lower the ReHo in patients with MCI and AD. Combining our findings with the results in earlier studies, we propose that the spontaneous activity pattern in the resting state could potentially be used as a clinical marker for MCI/AD. ",
pmid_22036801,Remitted major depression is characterized by reward network hyperactivation during reward anticipation and hypoactivation during reward outcomes.,,"Although functional brain imaging has established that individuals with unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD) are characterized by frontostriatal dysfunction during reward processing, no research to date has examined the chronometry of neural responses to rewards in euthymic individuals with a history of MDD. A monetary incentive delay task was used during fMRI scanning to assess neural responses in frontostriatal reward regions during reward anticipation and outcomes in 19 participants with remitted major depressive disorder (rMDD) and in 19 matched control participants. During the anticipation phase of the task, the rMDD group was characterized by relatively greater activation in bilateral anterior cingulate gyrus, in right midfrontal gyrus, and in the right cerebellum. During the outcome phase of the task, the rMDD group was characterized by relatively decreased activation in bilateral orbital frontal cortex, right frontal pole, left insular cortex, and left thalamus. Exploratory analyses indicated that activation within a right frontal pole cluster that differentiated groups during reward anticipation predicted the number of lifetime depressive episodes within the rMDD group. Replication with larger samples is needed. Results suggest a double dissociation between reward network reactivity and temporal phase of the reward response in rMDD, such that rMDD is generally characterized by reward network hyperactivation during reward anticipation and reward network hypoactivation during reward outcomes. More broadly, these data suggest that aberrant frontostriatal response to rewards may potentially represent a trait marker for MDD, though future research is needed to evaluate the prospective utility of this functional neural endophenotype as a marker of MDD risk.

pmid_21040288,Altered neural function in pediatric bipolar disorder during reversal learning.,,"Data documenting the functional impairment associated with the diagnosis of bipolar disorder (BD) in children and adolescents highlight the need for greater understanding of its pathophysiology. Toward that end, we demonstrated previously that BD youth have behavioral deficits on reversal learning tasks. On such tasks, participants must first acquire a stimulus/response relationship through trial-and-error learning, and then discern when the stimulus/reward relationship reverses. Here, we use event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to elucidate neural correlates of reversal learning deficits in euthymic BD youth compared to typically developing controls.   We compared euthymic pediatric BD participants (n = 16) versus age-, sex-, and IQ-matched controls (n = 16). Our main outcome measure was blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal measured with fMRI during an event-related probabilistic reversal task. Pediatric BD participants had significantly greater neural activity than controls in fronto-parietal regions during the reversal phase, particularly in response to punished reversal errors (p < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons). Our current study suggests that during reversal learning, BD youths inefficiently recruit regions associated with processing response conflict and implementing alternative responses, including subdivisions of the frontal cortex and the parietal cortex. Such deficits are present in euthymic BD youth. Further work is necessary to evaluate the specificity of such alterations. ",
pmid_24671141,Mediation of the relationship between callous-unemotional traits and proactive aggression by amygdala response to fear among children with conduct problems.,,"Among youths with conduct problems, callous-unemotional (CU) traits are known to be an important determinant of symptom severity, prognosis, and treatment responsiveness. But positive correlations between conduct problems and CU traits result in suppressor effects that may mask important neurobiological distinctions among subgroups of children with conduct problems. To assess the unique neurobiological covariates of CU traits and externalizing behaviors in youths with conduct problems and determine whether neural dysfunction linked to CU traits mediates the link between callousness and proactive aggression. This cross-sectional case-control study involved behavioral testing and neuroimaging that were conducted at a university research institution. Neuroimaging was conducted using a 3-T Siemens magnetic resonance imaging scanner. It included 46 community-recruited male and female juveniles aged 10 to 17 years, including 16 healthy control participants and 30 youths with conduct problems with both low and high levels of CU traits. Blood oxygenation level-dependent signal as measured via functional magnetic resonance imaging during an implicit face-emotion processing task and analyzed using whole-brain and region of interest-based analysis of variance and multiple-regression analyses. Analysis of variance revealed no group differences in the amygdala. By contrast, consistent with the existence of suppressor effects, multiple-regression analysis found amygdala responses to fearful expressions to be negatively associated with CU traits (x = 26, y = 0, z = -12; k = 1) and positively associated with externalizing behavior (x = 24, y = 0, z = -14; k = 8) when both variables were modeled simultaneously. Reduced amygdala responses mediated the relationship between CU traits and proactive aggression. The results linked proactive aggression in youths with CU traits to hypoactive amygdala responses to emotional distress cues, consistent with theories that externalizing behaviors, particularly proactive aggression, in youths with these traits stem from deficient empathic responses to distress. Amygdala hypoactivity may represent an intermediate phenotype, offering new insights into effective treatment strategies for conduct problems. ",

Alcohol use

Marijuana use
Stroop","Despite studies showing the relevance of different decision-making abilities, including response inhibition, to likelihood of using substances during adolescence, few have examined these neural processes among high-risk, substance-using youth. The current study explored associations between alcohol and marijuana use and functional activation differences during Stroop performance among a large sample (N=80) of ethnically-diverse, high-risk youth in an fMRI-based task. In the absence of associations between substance use and task behavioral performance, adolescents with greater alcohol use showed less activation during the more cognitively difficult portion of the task across clusters in bilateral cuneus and precuneus, and right and left superior temporal gyrus. No associations were observed with marijuana use. The current results may suggest neural patterns of deactivation in regions important for cognitive control, such that alcohol use may confer additional risk for future decreased inhibition among these high-risk adolescents. The ability to inhibit prepotent responses has been shown to predict later response to treatment, and early interventions to encourage further development of cognitive control could represent promising options for treatment.

pmid_20739053,Superior parietal lobule dysfunction in a homogeneous group of dyslexic children with a visual attention span disorder.,,"A visual attention (VA) span disorder has been reported in dyslexic children as potentially responsible for their poor reading outcome. The purpose of the current paper was to identify the cerebral correlates of this VA span disorder. For this purpose, 12 French dyslexic children with severe reading and VA span disorders and 12 age-matched control children were engaged in a categorisation task under fMRI. Two flanked and isolated conditions were designed which both involved multiple-element simultaneous visual processing but taxed visual attention differently. For skilled readers, flanked stimuli processing activated a large bilateral cortical network comprising the superior and inferior parietal cortex, the inferior temporal cortex, the striate and extrastriate visual cortex, the middle frontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex while the less attention-demanding task of isolated stimuli only activated the inferior occipito-temporal cortex bilaterally. With respect to controls, the dyslexic children showed significantly reduced activation within bilateral parietal and temporal areas during flanked processing, but no difference during the isolated condition. The neural correlates of the processes involved in attention-demanding multi-element processing tasks were more specifically addressed by contrasting the flanked and the isolated conditions. This contrast elicited activation of the left precuneus/superior parietal lobule in the controls, but not in the dyslexic children. These findings provide new insights on the role of parietal regions, in particular the left superior parietal lobule, in the visual attention span and in developmental dyslexia. ",
pmid_21325618,The effect of treatment expectation on drug efficacy: imaging the analgesic benefit of the opioid remifentanil.,,"Evidence from behavioral and self-reported data suggests that the patients' beliefs and expectations can shape both therapeutic and adverse effects of any given drug. We investigated how divergent expectancies alter the analgesic efficacy of a potent opioid in healthy volunteers by using brain imaging. The effect of a fixed concentration of the μ-opioid agonist remifentanil on constant heat pain was assessed under three experimental conditions using a within-subject design: with no expectation of analgesia, with expectancy of a positive analgesic effect, and with negative expectancy of analgesia (that is, expectation of hyperalgesia or exacerbation of pain). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to record brain activity to corroborate the effects of expectations on the analgesic efficacy of the opioid and to elucidate the underlying neural mechanisms. Positive treatment expectancy substantially enhanced (doubled) the analgesic benefit of remifentanil. In contrast, negative treatment expectancy abolished remifentanil analgesia. These subjective effects were substantiated by significant changes in the neural activity in brain regions involved with the coding of pain intensity. The positive expectancy effects were associated with activity in the endogenous pain modulatory system, and the negative expectancy effects with activity in the hippocampus. On the basis of subjective and objective evidence, we contend that an individual's expectation of a drug's effect critically influences its therapeutic efficacy and that regulatory brain mechanisms differ as a function of expectancy. We propose that it may be necessary to integrate patients' beliefs and expectations into drug treatment regimes alongside traditional considerations in order to optimize treatment outcomes. ",
pmid_20147457,Individual differences in dispositional mindfulness and brain activity involved in reappraisal of emotion.,,"The regulation of negative emotion through reappraisal has been shown to induce increased prefrontal activity and decreased amygdala activity. Individual differences in dispositional mindfulness reflect differences in typical recognition, detachment and regulation of current experience, thought to also operate as top-down control mechanism. We sought to investigate whether such individual differences would be associated with brain activity elicited during reappraisal of negative emotion. Eighteen healthy participants completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging task that involved attending to or reappraising negative stimuli, and provided emotion experience ratings after each trial. Dispositional mindfulness was assessed with a self-report questionnaire. Reappraisal induced activity in a brain network involving predominantly dorsal portions of the prefrontal cortex, replicating previous studies. A voxelwise regression analysis showed that individual differences in the tendency to be mindful predicted activity in neural regions underlying reappraisal, with dorsomedial prefrontal cortex activation increasing with more mindfulness traits. Notably, this prefrontal activation was inversely correlated with the amygdala response to negative scenes, further supporting its role in down-regulating emotion-generation regions. These findings suggest that individual differences in dispositional mindfulness, which reflect the tendency to recognize and regulate current states, may modulate activity in neural systems involved in the effective cognitive control of negative emotion.

pmid_27534834,Mismatch negativity (MMN) stands at the crossroads between explicit and implicit emotional processing.,"amygdala reactivity
explicit and implicit emotional processing
mismatch negativity","The amygdala is known as a key brain region involved in the explicit and implicit processing of emotional faces, and plays a crucial role in salience detection. Not until recently was the mismatch negativity (MMN), a component of the event-related potentials to an odd stimulus in a sequence of stimuli, utilized as an index of preattentive salience detection of emotional voice processing. However, their relationship remains to be delineated. This study combined the fMRI scanning and event-related potential recording by examining amygdala reactivity in response to explicit and implicit (backward masked) perception of fearful and angry faces, along with recording MMN in response to the fearfully and angrily spoken syllables dada in healthy subjects who varied in trait anxiety (STAI-T). Results indicated that the amplitudes of fearful MMN were positively correlated with left amygdala reactivity to explicit perception of fear, but negatively correlated with right amygdala reactivity to implicit perception of fear. The fearful MMN predicted STAI-T along with left amygdala reactivity to explicit fear, whereas the association between fearful MMN and STAI-T was mediated by right amygdala reactivity to implicit fear. These findings suggest that amygdala reactivity in response to explicit and implicit threatening faces exhibits opposite associations with emotional MMN. In terms of emotional processing, MMN not only reflects preattentive saliency detection but also stands at the crossroads of explicit and implicit perception.

pmid_20205245,Disorder-specific inferior prefrontal hypofunction in boys with pure attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder compared to boys with pure conduct disorder during cognitive flexibility.,,"Problems with cognitive flexibility have been observed in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and in patients with conduct disorder (CD), characterized by the violation of societal rules and the rights of others. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of cognitive switching, however, has only been investigated in patients with ADHD, including comorbidity with CD, finding frontostriatal and temporoparietal underactivation. This study investigates disorder-specific functional abnormalities during cognitive flexibility between medication-naïve children and adolescents with noncomorbid CD and those with noncomorbid ADHD compared to healthy controls. Event-related fMRI was used to compare brain activation of 14 boys with noncomorbid, childhood-onset CD, 14 boys with noncomorbid ADHD, and 20 healthy comparison boys during a visual-spatial Switch task. Behaviorally, children with ADHD compared to children with CD had significantly slower reaction times to switch compared to repeat trials. The fMRI comparison showed that the patients with ADHD compared to both controls and patients with CD showed underactivation in right and left inferior prefrontal cortex. No disorder-specific brain underactivation was observed in patients with CD. Only when compared with controls alone, the disruptive behavior group showed reduced activation in bilateral temporoparietal and occipital brain regions. The findings extend previous evidence for disorder-specific underactivation in patients with ADHD compared to patients with CD in inferior prefrontal cortex during tasks of inhibitory control to the domain of cognitive flexibility. Inferior prefrontal underactivation thus appears to be a disorder-specific neurofunctional biomarker for ADHD when compared with patients with CD. ",
pmid_17916330,Neural responses to monetary incentives in major depression.,,"Reduced responsiveness to positive incentives is a central feature of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). In the present study, we compared neural correlates of monetary incentive processing in unmedicated depressed participants and never-depressed control subjects. Fourteen currently depressed and 12 never-depressed participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while participating in a monetary incentive delay task. During the task, participants were cued to anticipate and respond to a rapidly presented target to gain or avoid losing varying amounts of money. Depressed and never-depressed participants did not differ in nucleus accumbens (NAcc) activation or in affective or behavioral responses during gain anticipation. Depressed participants did, however, exhibit increasing anterior cingulate activation during anticipation of increasing gains, whereas never-depressed participants showed increasing anterior cingulate activation during anticipation of increasing loss. Depressed participants also showed reduced discrimination of gain versus nongain outcomes. The present findings indicate that although unmedicated depressed individuals have the capacity to experience positive arousal and recruit NAcc activation during gain anticipation, they also exhibit increased anterior cingulate cortex activation, suggestive of increased conflict during anticipation of gains, in addition to showing reduced discrimination of gain versus nongain outcomes.

pmid_19806158,Increased dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation in obese children during observation of food stimuli.,,"Food cues yield different patterns of brain activation in obese compared with normal-weight adults in prefrontal and limbic/paralimbic areas. For children, no mapping studies comparing representation sites for food and other stimuli between obese and normal-weight subjects are available. We used a cross-sectional design of two age-matched subject groups to investigate differences in brain activation in response to visually presented food, pleasant, and neutral pictures between obese/overweight and normal children. 22 overweight/obese children were compared with 22 normal-weight children. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (of the whole head during perception of visually presented stimuli), psychological testing, and psychophysical measures of heart rate deceleration were assessed. Obese children showed higher activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in response to food pictures. In addition, DLPFC activation was negatively correlated with self-esteem. In contrast, normal-weight children showed higher activation of the caudate and hippocampus specific to food pictures, and of the anterior cingulate cortex and thalamus to visual cues in general. In response to food stimuli, obese children showed a heart rate deceleration correlating positively with activation of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Obese children react to food stimuli with increased prefrontal activation, which might be associated with increased inhibitory control. ",

Migraine
Tension-type headache
Voxel-based morphometry","Despite evidently distinct symptoms, tension-type headache (TTH) and migraine are highly comorbid and exhibit many similarities in clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether both types of headaches are similar in brain morphology. Consecutive patients with TTH and age- and sex-matched patients with migraine and healthy controls were enrolled for brain magnetic resonance imaging examination. Patients with TTH were excluded if they reported any headache features or associated symptoms of migraine. Changes in gray matter (GM) volume associated with headache diagnosis (TTH vs. migraine) and frequency (episodic vs. chronic) were examined using voxel-based morphometry. The correlation with headache profile and the discriminative ability between TTH and migraine were also investigated for these GM changes. In comparison with controls (n = 43), the patients with TTH (25 episodic and 24 chronic) exhibited a GM volume increase in the anterior cingulate cortex, supramarginal gyrus, temporal pole, lateral occipital cortex, and caudate. The patients with migraine (31 episodic and 25 chronic) conversely exhibited a GM volume decrease in the orbitofrontal cortex. These GM changes did not correlate with any headache profile. A voxel-wise 2 × 2 factorial analysis further revealed the substantial effects of headache types and frequency in the comparison of GM volume between TTH and migraine. Specifically, the migraine group (vs. TTH) had a GM decrease in the superior and middle frontal gyri, cerebellum, dorsal striatum, and precuneus. The chronic group (vs. episodic group) otherwise demonstrated a GM decrease in the bilateral insula and anterior cingulate cortex. In receiver operating characteristic analysis, the GM volumes of the left superior frontal gyrus and right cerebellum V combined had good discriminative ability for distinguishing TTH and migraine (area under the curve = 0.806). TTH and migraine are separate headache disorders with different characteristics in relation to GM changes. The major morphological difference between the two types of headaches is the relative GM decrease of the prefrontal and cerebellar regions in migraine, which may reflect a higher allostatic load associated with this disabling headache.

pmid_24968124,Exploring the patterns of acupuncture on mild cognitive impairment patients using regional homogeneity.,,"To investigate the different responses to acupuncture in MCI patients and age-matched healthy subjects reflected by the Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) indices. The experiment was performed at the acupoint KI3 in 12 MCI patients and 12 healthy controls, respectively. A novel non-repeated event-related (NRER) fMRI design paradigm was applied to separately detect neural activities related to different stages of acupuncture (pre-acupuncture resting state, needling manipulation and post-acupuncture resting state). ReHo values were calculated for MCI patients and healthy controls in pre- and post-acupuncture resting state. Then, a two-way ANCOVA with repeated measures with post-hoc two sample t-tests was performed to explore the different responses to acupuncture in the two groups. The ANCOVA revealed a significant main effect of group, but no significant main effect of acupuncture and interactions between group and acupuncture. During the pre-acupuncture resting state, ReHo values increased in the precentral gyrus (PCG), superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and insula (INS) and decreased mainly in middle temporal gyrus (MTG), parahippocampal (PHIP) and cingulate cortex in MCI patients compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, we found that the regions including precuneus (PCUN), and cingulate cortex showed increased ReHo values for MCI patients following acupuncture. For healthy controls, the medial frontal gyrus, PCG, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and INS showed enhanced ReHo values following acupuncture. During the post-acupuncture resting state, MCI patients showed increased ReHo values mainly in the MTG, superior parietal lobule (SPL), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), supramarginal (SMG), and PCG, and decreased ReHo values mainly in the frontal regions, PHIP, and posterior cingulated cortex (PCC) compared to healthy controls. Though we found some ReHo changes between MCI patients and healthy controls, the two-way ANCOVA results showed no significant effects after multiple corrections. Further study is needed to reveal the real acupuncture effects on MCI patients. ",
pmid_19709634,Activation of the opioidergic descending pain control system underlies placebo analgesia.,,"Placebo analgesia involves the endogenous opioid system, as administration of the opioid antagonist naloxone decreases placebo analgesia. To investigate the opioidergic mechanisms that underlie placebo analgesia, we combined naloxone administration with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Naloxone reduced both behavioral and neural placebo effects as well as placebo-induced responses in pain-modulatory cortical structures, such as the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC). In a brainstem-specific analysis, we observed a similar naloxone modulation of placebo-induced responses in key structures of the descending pain control system, including the hypothalamus, the periaqueductal gray (PAG), and the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). Most importantly, naloxone abolished placebo-induced coupling between rACC and PAG, which predicted both neural and behavioral placebo effects as well as activation of the RVM. These findings show that opioidergic signaling in pain-modulating areas and the projections to downstream effectors of the descending pain control system are crucially important for placebo analgesia.

pmid_12498752,Neural basis of temporal context memory: a functional MRI study.,,"Temporal context information is crucial to understanding human episodic memory. Human lesion and neuroimaging data indicate that prefrontal regions are important for retrieving temporal context memory, although the exact nature of their involvement is still unclear. We employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to elucidate the neural basis of two kinds of temporal context memory: the temporal order of items between lists and within a list. On the day of the fMRI experiment, subjects memorized a list of 30 pictures in the morning and another list of 30 pictures in the afternoon. During the scanning session, the subjects performed three tasks. In a between-lists task, they were asked to judge the temporal order between two items that had been presented in different lists. In a within-list task, they were asked to judge the temporal order between two items that had been presented in a single list. We found bilateral prefrontal activities during these two temporal context memory tasks compared with a simple item-recognition task. Furthermore, in direct comparison between these two tasks, we found differential prefrontal activities. Thus, right prefrontal activity was associated with temporal order judgment of items between lists, whereas left prefrontal activity was related to temporal order judgment of items within a list. These results indicate that retrieval processes of two kinds of temporal context memory are supported by different, but overlapping, sets of cerebral regions. We speculate that this reflects different cognitive processes for retrieving temporal context memory between separate episodes and within a single episode. ",
pmid_16139525,Dysfunction of ventral striatal reward prediction in schizophrenia.,,"Negative symptoms may be associated with dysfunction of the brain reward system in schizophrenia. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess the BOLD response in the ventral striatum of unmedicated schizophrenics during presentation of reward-indicating and loss-indicating stimuli. A total of 10 schizophrenic men (7 never medicated, 3 unmedicated for at least 2 years) and 10 age-matched healthy male volunteers participated in an incentive monetary delay task, in which visual cues predicted that a rapid response to a subsequent target stimulus would result either in monetary gain or loss or would have no consequence. Compared to healthy controls, unmedicated schizophrenics showed reduced ventral striatal activation during the presentation of reward-indicating cues. Decreased activation of the left ventral striatum was inversely correlated with the severity of negative (and trendwise positive) symptoms. Reduced activation in one of the central areas of the brain reward system, the ventral striatum, was correlated with the severity of negative symptoms in medication-free schizophrenics. In unmedicated schizophrenic patients, a high striatal dopamine turnover may increase the ""noise"" in the reward system, thus interfering with the neuronal processing of reward-predicting cues by phasic dopamine release. This, in turn, may contribute to negative symptoms as such as anhedonia, apathy, and loss of drive and motivation. ",

However, the progressive structural alteration pattern remains unknown. To elaborate the progressive structural alteration of depression according to illness duration, we recruited 195 never-treated first-episode patients with depression and 130 healthy controls (HCs) undergoing T1-weighted MRI scans. Voxel-based morphometry method was adopted to measure gray matter volume (GMV) for each participant. Patients were first divided into three stages according to the length of illness duration, then we explored stage-specific GMV alterations and the causal effect relationship between them using causal structural covariance network (CaSCN) analysis. Overall, patients with depression presented stage-specific GMV alterations compared with HCs. Regions including the hippocampus, the thalamus and the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) presented GMV alteration at onset of illness. Then as the illness advanced, others regions began to present GMV alterations. These results suggested that GMV alteration originated from the hippocampus, the thalamus and vmPFC then expanded to other brain regions. The results of CaSCN analysis revealed that the hippocampus and the vmPFC corporately exerted causal effect on regions such as nucleus accumbens, the precuneus and the cerebellum. In addition, GMV alteration in the hippocampus was also potentially causally related to that in the dorsolateral frontal gyrus. Consistent with the neuroprogressive hypothesis, our results reveal progressive morphological alteration originating from the vmPFC and the hippocampus and further elucidate possible details about disease progression of depression.

Sixty C-IBS patients were assigned to 2 groups by simple randomized method, i.e. EA group (30 cases) and Mox group (30 cases). Both EA and Mox treatments were performed on bilateral Tianshu (ST 25) and Shangjuxu (ST 37) for 30 min each time, 6 times per week, for 4 consecutive weeks. The gastrointestinal symptoms and psychological symptoms of the two groups were scored before and after treatment. The effects on the corresponding functional brain areas, namely the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insular cortex (IC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) were observed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after treatment. Compared with the Mox group, greater improvements in abdominal distension, defecation frequency, diffificulty in defecation and stool features were observed in the EA group (all P<0.01), both Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores were signifificantly decreased in the EA group (all P<0.01). Finally, decreased activated voxel values were observed in the ACC, right IC and PFC brain regions of EA group with 150 mL colorectal distension stimulation (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Both EA and Mox could signifificantly improve some of the most intrusive symptoms of C-IBS patients, and EA was more effective than Mox. The therapeutic effect of these two therapies might through modulating of the brain-gut axis function. (Registration No. ChiCTRTRC-11001349). ",
pmid_23131525,Neural correlates of affective priming effects based on masked facial emotion: an fMRI study.,,"Affective priming refers to the phenomenon that subliminal presentation of facial emotion biases subsequent evaluation of a neutral object in the direction of the prime. The aim of the present study was to specify the neural correlates of evaluative shifts elicited by facial emotion shown below the threshold of conscious perception. We tested the hypotheses whether the amygdala is involved in negative priming, whereas the nucleus accumbens participates in positive priming. In addition, exploratory whole brain correlation analyses were conducted. During 3T fMRI scanning, pictures of sad, happy, and neutral facial expression masked by neutral faces were presented to 110 healthy adults who had to judge valence of masks on a four-point scale. There was evidence for significant negative priming based on sad faces. A correlation was observed between amygdala activation and negative priming. Activation in medial, middle, and superior frontal and middle temporo-occipital areas, and insula was also associated with negative priming. No significant priming based on happy faces was found. However, nucleus accumbens activation to happy faces correlated with the positive priming score. The present findings confirm that the amygdala but also other brain regions, especially the medial frontal cortex, appear involved in automatically elicited negative evaluative shifts. ",

Visual-vestibular interaction
fMRI","In this event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study we investigated how the brain of patients with bilateral vestibular failure (BVF) responds to vestibular stimuli. We used imperceptible noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) and perceptible bi-mastoidal GVS intensities and related the corresponding brain activity to the evoked motion perception. In contrast to caloric irrigation, GVS stimulates the vestibular organ at its potentially intact afferent nerve site. Motion perception thresholds and cortical responses were compared between 26 BVF patients to 27 age-matched healthy control participants. To identify the specificity of vestibular cortical responses we used a parametric design with different stimulus intensities (noisy imperceptible, low perceptible, high perceptible) allowing region-specific stimulus response functions. In a 2 × 3 flexible factorial design all GVS-related brain activities were contrasted with a sham condition that did not evoke perceived motion. Patients had a higher motion perception threshold and rated the vestibular stimuli higher than the healthy participants. There was a stimulus intensity related and region-specific increase of activity with steep stimulus response functions in parietal operculum (e.g. OP2), insula, superior temporal gyrus, early visual cortices (V3) and cerebellum while activity in the hippocampus and intraparietal sulcus did not correlate with vestibular stimulus intensity. Using whole brain analysis, group comparisons revealed increased brain activity in early visual cortices (V3) and superior temporal gyrus of patients but there was no significant interaction, i.e. stimulus-response function in these regions were still similar in both groups. Brain activity in these regions during (high)GVS increased with higher dizziness-related handicap scores but was not related to the degree of vestibular impairment or disease duration. nGVS did not evoke cortical responses in any group. Our data indicate that perceptible GVS-related cortical responsivity is not diminished but increased in multisensory (visual-vestibular) cortical regions despite bilateral failure of the peripheral vestibular organ. The increased activity in early visual cortices (V3) and superior temporal gyrus of BVF patients has several potential implications: (i) their cortical reciprocal inhibitory visuo-vestibular interaction is dysfunctional, (ii) it may contribute to the visual dependency of BVF patients, and (iii) it needs to be considered when BVF patients receive peripheral vestibular stimulation devices, e.g. vestibular implants or portable GVS devices. Imperceptible nGVS did not elicit cortical brain responses making it unlikely that the reported balance improvement of BVF by nGVS is mediated by cortical mechanisms. ",

We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis, whole-brain analysis of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), and resting-state seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis to investigate brain structural and functional deficits in SCZ. Also, we applied Pearson's correlation analysis to validate the correlation between Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) scores and them. Compared with healthy controls, SCZ showed increased gray matter volume (GMV) of the left thalamus ( Collectively, these results suggest the possibility of aberrant laterality in the left thalamus and its FC with other related brain regions involved in the limbic system.

Resting-state BOLD","Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the resting state, particularly fMRI based on the blood-oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal, has been extensively used to measure functional connectivity in the brain. However, the mechanisms of vascular regulation that underlie the BOLD fluctuations during rest are still poorly understood. In this work, using dual-echo pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling and MR angiography (MRA), we assess the spatio-temporal contribution of cerebral blood flow (CBF) to the resting-state BOLD signals and explore how the coupling of these signals is associated with regional vasculature. Using a general linear model analysis, we found that statistically significant coupling between resting-state BOLD and CBF fluctuations is highly variable across the brain, but the coupling is strongest within the major nodes of established resting-state networks, including the default-mode, visual, and task-positive networks. Moreover, by exploiting MRA-derived large vessel (macrovascular) volume fraction, we found that the degree of BOLD-CBF coupling significantly decreased as the ratio of large vessels to tissue volume increased. These findings suggest that the portion of resting-state BOLD fluctuations at the sites of medium-to-small vessels (more proximal to local neuronal activity) is more closely regulated by dynamic regulations in CBF, and that this CBF regulation decreases closer to large veins, which are more distal to neuronal activity.

pmid_15193584,Functional dissociations within the inferior parietal cortex in verbal working memory.,,"Neuroimaging studies of working memory have revealed two sites in the left supramarginal gyrus that may support the short-term storage of phonological information. Activation in the left dorsal aspect of the inferior parietal cortex (DIPC) has been observed in contrasts of working memory load, whereas activation in the ventral aspect of the inferior parietal cortex (VIPC) has been found primarily in contrast of information type (verbal vs. nonverbal). Our goal was to determine whether these two areas are functionally distinct or if instead they are part of a homogeneous region with large variations in the focus of peak activity. Toward this end, we used fMRI to assess the neural response in two working memory tasks (N-back and item recognition) in which we also manipulated memory load and the type of information to be recalled (verbal vs. nonverbal). We found both DIPC and VIPC activation in the same group of subjects and further demonstrated that they have differential sensitivity to our experimental factors. Only the DIPC showed robust load effects, whereas only the VIPC showed reliable effects of information type. These results help to account for the differences observed in between-subject comparisons, and they indicate that the two regions are functionally dissociable. In contrast to the DIPC, activity of the VIPC was also recruited in the fixation and low-load conditions, a surprising result that has not been fully explored in prior studies. Despite their distinctive patterns of performance, neither of these regions displayed a pattern of activity that entirely corresponds to common assumptions of a dedicated phonological short-term store (STS). Instead, we hypothesize that the DIPC may support domain-general executive processes, while the VIPC may support phonological encoding-recoding processes central to a variety of language tasks. ",

We used three methods of statistical analysis to interrogate similarities and differences in whole-brain activity across retrieval tasks, while focussing on prefrontal cortex (PFC) activations: multivariate partial least squares analysis (PLS), univariate statistical parametric mapping (SPM) and conjunction analysis. The PLS and conjunction analyses indicated that the overall pattern of PFC activity was similar across both temporal and spatial context retrieval tasks; but the SPM results indicated that some of these PFC regions exhibited differences in the degree to which they were engaged between tasks. However, none of these methods identified unique PFC activations specific to mediating spatial and/or temporal context retrieval. These results indicate that, overall, similar patterns of PFC activity were observed during temporal and spatial context memory retrieval once task structure and performance were equated. ",
pmid_22836520,Differential working memory correlates for implicit sequence performance in young and older adults.,,"Our recent work has revealed that visuospatial working memory (VSWM) relates to the rate of explicit motor sequence learning (Bo and Seidler in J Neurophysiol 101:3116-3125, 2009) and implicit sequence performance (Bo et al. in Exp Brain Res 214:73-81, 2011a) in young adults (YA). Although aging has a detrimental impact on many cognitive functions, including working memory, older adults (OA) still rely on their declining working memory resources in an effort to optimize explicit motor sequence learning. Here, we evaluated whether age-related differences in VSWM and/or verbal working memory (VWM) performance relates to implicit performance change in the serial reaction time (SRT) sequence task in OA. Participants performed two computerized working memory tasks adapted from change detection working memory assessments (Luck and Vogel in Nature 390:279-281, 1997), an implicit SRT task and several neuropsychological tests. We found that, although OA exhibited an overall reduction in both VSWM and VWM, both OA and YA showed similar performance in the implicit SRT task. Interestingly, while VSWM and VWM were significantly correlated with each other in YA, there was no correlation between these two working memory scores in OA. In YA, the rate of SRT performance change (exponential fit to the performance curve) was significantly correlated with both VSWM and VWM, while in contrast, OA's performance was only correlated with VWM, and not VSWM. These results demonstrate differential reliance on VSWM and VWM for SRT performance between YA and OA. OA may utilize VWM to maintain optimized performance of second-order conditional sequences. ",
pmid_20546170,Neuroanatomical correlates of attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder accounting for comorbid oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder.,,"An increasing number of neuroimaging studies have been conducted to uncover the pathophysiology of attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The findings are inconsistent, however, at least partially due to methodological differences. In the present study voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to evaluate brain morphology in ADHD subjects after taking into account the confounding effect of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD) comorbidity. Eighteen children with ADHD and 17 age- and gender-matched typically developing subjects underwent high-spatial resolution magnetic resonance imaging. The regional gray matter volume differences between the children with ADHD and controls were examined with and without accounting for comorbid ODD and CD in a voxel-by-voxel manner throughout the entire brain. The VBM indicated significantly smaller regional gray matter volume in regions including the bilateral temporal polar and occipital cortices and the left amygdala in subjects with ADHD compared with controls. Significantly smaller regional gray matter volumes were demonstrated in more extensive regions including the bilateral temporal polar cortices, bilateral amygdala, right occipital cortex, right superior temporal sulcus, and left middle frontal gyrus after controlling for the confounding effect of comorbid ODD and CD. Morphological abnormalities in ADHD were seen not only in the regions associated with executive functioning but also in the regions associated with social cognition. When the effect of comorbid CD and ODD was taken into account, there were more extensive regions with significantly smaller volume in ADHD compared to controls. ",
pmid_11306644,Functional anatomy of nonvisual feedback loops during reaching: a positron emission tomography study.,,"Reaching movements performed without vision of the moving limb are continuously monitored, during their execution, by feedback loops (designated nonvisual). In this study, we investigated the functional anatomy of these nonvisual loops using positron emission tomography (PET). Seven subjects had to ""look at"" (eye) or ""look and point to"" (eye-arm) visual targets whose location either remained stationary or changed undetectably during the ocular saccade (when vision is suppressed). Slightly changing the target location during gaze shift causes an increase in the amount of correction to be generated. Functional anatomy of nonvisual feedback loops was identified by comparing the reaching condition involving large corrections (jump) with the reaching condition involving small corrections (stationary), after subtracting the activations associated with saccadic movements and hand movement planning [(eye-arm-jumping minus eye-jumping) minus (eye-arm-stationary minus eye-stationary)]. Behavioral data confirmed that the subjects were both accurate at reaching to the stationary targets and able to update their movement smoothly and early in response to the target jump. PET difference images showed that these corrections were mediated by a restricted network involving the left posterior parietal cortex, the right anterior intermediate cerebellum, and the left primary motor cortex. These results are consistent with our knowledge of the functional properties of these areas and more generally with models emphasizing parietal-cerebellar circuits for processing a dynamic motor error signal.

olanzapine
voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity","Deficits in homotopic connectivity have been implicated in schizophrenia. However, alterations in homotopic connectivity associated with antipsychotic treatments in schizophrenia remain unclear due to lack of longitudinal studies. Seventeen drug-free patients with recurrent schizophrenia and 24 healthy controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. The patients were scanned at three time points (baseline, at 6 weeks of treatment, and at 6 months of treatment). Voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) was applied to analyse the imaging data to examine alterations in VMHC associated with antipsychotic treatment. The results showed that patients with schizophrenia exhibited decreased VMHC in the default-mode network (such as the precuneus and inferior parietal lobule) and the motor and sensory processing regions (such as the lingual gyrus, fusiform gyrus and cerebellum lobule VI), which could be normalised or denormalised by olanzapine treatment. In addition, negative correlations were found between decreased VMHC and symptom severity in the patients at baseline. The present study shows that olanzapine treatment can normalise or denormalise decreased homotopic connectivity in schizophrenia. The findings also provide a new perspective to understand treatment effects of antipsychotic drugs on homotopic connectivity in schizophrenia that contribute to the disconnection hypothesis of this disease.

pmid_16275140,Dissociable roles of the bilateral anterior temporal lobe in face-name associations: an event-related fMRI study.,,"Previous studies have suggested the importance of bilateral anterior temporal regions in face-name associations, but there is little evidence concerning their precise role. In this fMRI study, we investigated the effects of person-related semantics (PS) and repeated learning (R) on activations in these regions during the retrieval of face-name associations. For encoding stimuli, we prepared four lists of faces. To control the factor of PS, people's and occupation names were attached to the faces in lists A and B, whereas only people's names were attached to the faces in lists C and D. To control the factor of R, the stimuli in lists A and C were learned twice, whereas the stimuli in lists B and D were learned seven times during encoding before fMRI. During fMRI after the encoding, subjects participated in the retrieval task of people's names from faces or in the retrieval task of faces from people's names. The left anterior temporal lobe was significantly activated during the retrieval of people's names from faces encoded with, compared to without, PS; whereas the right anterior temporal lobe was activated during the retrieval of people's faces from names, compared to without, this encoding. Also, activation of the left (but not the right) anterior temporal lobe was significantly reduced after R of face-name associations. These findings suggest that the three components of faces, names, and PS may be mutually mediated by the bilateral anterior temporal lobe, whose activity may be dynamically changed by the level of consolidation of face-name associations.

pmid_22264344,Neural responses associated with cue-reactivity in frequent cannabis users.,,"Cue-reactivity reflects enhanced motivational processing underlying continued substance use and relapse in substance use disorders. Substance use disorders are associated with greater cue-reactivity in orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, striatum, ventral tegmental area and amygdala. Here we examine whether this also holds for frequent cannabis users. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), neural responses to neutral and cannabis-related cues were compared between frequent cannabis users (n = 31), sporadic cannabis users (n = 20) and cannabis-naive controls (n = 21). In addition, fMRI findings were correlated with the level of cannabis use, problem severity and craving. In frequent users compared with sporadic users and controls, cannabis images engendered higher activation than control images in the ventral tegmental area. Activation of the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and striatum was only higher in a subgroup of frequent users with high compared with low-problem severity. Activity in the right putamen and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex correlated negatively with subjective craving in frequent users. Activity was not correlated with level of cannabis use. These findings indicate that cannabis cues activate areas associated with addiction pathology in frequent cannabis users compared with sporadic users and controls. However, among frequent users, cue-reactivity seems to be primarily associated with problem severity, not with amount of cannabis use. These findings imply neural cue-reactivity as a tool in assessing problem severity of cannabis use. ",
pmid_12498747,Visual imagery of famous faces: effects of memory and attention revealed by fMRI.,,"Complex pictorial information can be represented and retrieved from memory as mental visual images. Functional brain imaging studies have shown that visual perception and visual imagery share common neural substrates. The type of memory (short- or long-term) that mediates the generation of mental images, however, has not been addressed previously. The purpose of this study was to investigate the neural correlates underlying imagery generated from short- and long-term memory (STM and LTM). We used famous faces to localize the visual response during perception and to compare the responses during visual imagery generated from STM (subjects memorized specific pictures of celebrities before the imagery task) and imagery from LTM (subjects imagined famous faces without seeing specific pictures during the experimental session). We found that visual perception of famous faces activated the inferior occipital gyri, lateral fusiform gyri, the superior temporal sulcus, and the amygdala. Small subsets of these face-selective regions were activated during imagery. Additionally, visual imagery of famous faces activated a network of regions composed of bilateral calcarine, hippocampus, precuneus, intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). In all these regions, imagery generated from STM evoked more activation than imagery from LTM. Regardless of memory type, focusing attention on features of the imagined faces (e.g., eyes, lips, or nose) resulted in increased activation in the right IPS and right IFG. Our results suggest differential effects of memory and attention during the generation and maintenance of mental images of faces. ",

neuroimaging","Placebo analgesia is often conceptualized as a reward mechanism. However, by targeting only negative experiences, such as pain, placebo research may tell only half the story. We compared placebo improvement of painful touch (analgesia) with placebo improvement of pleasant touch (hyperhedonia) using functional MRI and a crossover design. Somatosensory processing was decreased during placebo analgesia and increased during placebo hyperhedonia. Both placebo responses were associated with similar patterns of activation increase in circuitry involved in emotion appraisal, including the pregenual anterior cingulate, medial orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, accumbens, and midbrain structures. Importantly, placebo-induced coupling between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and periaqueductal gray correlated with somatosensory decreases to painful touch and somatosensory increases to pleasant touch. These findings suggest that placebo analgesia and hyperhedonia are mediated by activation of shared emotion appraisal neurocircuitry, which down- or up-regulates early sensory processing, depending on whether the expectation is reduced pain or increased pleasure.

pmid_19876663,An investigation of brain processes supporting meditation.,,"Meditation is an ancient spiritual practice, which aims to still the fluctuations of the mind. We investigated meditation with fMRI in order to identify and characterise both the ""neural switch"" mechanism used in the voluntary shift from normal consciousness to meditation and the ""threshold regulation mechanism"" sustaining the meditative state. Thirty-one individuals with 1.5-25 years experience in meditation were scanned using a blocked on-off design with 45 s alternating epochs during the onset of respectively meditation and normal relaxation. Additionally, 21 subjects were scanned during 14.5 min of sustained meditation. The data were analysed with SPM and ICA. During the onset of meditation, activations were found bilaterally in the putamen and the supplementary motor cortex, while deactivations were found predominately in the right hemisphere, the precuneus, the posterior cingulum and the parieto-temporal area. During sustained meditation, SPM analysis revealed activation in the head of nucleus caudatus. Extensive deactivations were observed in white matter in the right hemisphere, i.e. mainly in the posterior occipito-parieto-temporal area and in the frontal lobes. ICA identified 38 components including known baseline-resting state components, one of which not only overlaps with the activated area revealed in the SPM analysis but extends further into frontal, temporal, parietal and limbic areas, and might presumably constitute a combination of frontoparietal and cinguloopercular task control systems. The identified component processes display varying degrees of correlation. We hypothesise that a proper characterisation of brain processes during meditation will require an operational definition of brain dynamics matching a stable state of mind. ",
pmid_30419039,Can emotional content be extracted under interocular suppression?,,"Previous studies showed that emotional faces break through interocular suppression more easily compared to neutral faces under the continuous flash suppression (CFS) paradigm. However, there is controversy over whether emotional content or low-level properties contributed to the results. In this study, we directly manipulated the meaningfulness of facial expression to test the role of emotional content in breaking CFS (b-CFS). In addition, an explicit emotion judgment for different facial expressions (happy, neutral, and fearful) used in the b-CFS task was also conducted afterwards to examine the relationship between b-CFS time and emotion judgment. In Experiment 1, face orientation and luminance polarity were manipulated to generate upright-positive and inverted-negative faces. In Experiment 2, Asian and Caucasian faces were presented to Taiwanese participants so that these stimuli served as own-race and other-race faces, respectively. We found robust face familiarity effects in both experiments within the same experimental framework: upright-positive and own-race faces had shorter b-CFS times than inverted-negative and other-race faces, respectively. This indicates potential involvement of high-level processing under interocular suppression. In Experiment 1, different b-CFS times were found between emotional and neutral faces in both upright-positive and inverted-negative conditions. Furthermore, with sufficient duration (1000 ms) participants could still extract emotional content in explicit valence judgment even from inverted-negative faces, though with a smaller degree than upright-positive faces. In Experiment 2, differential b-CFS times were found between emotional and neutral faces with own-race but not other-race faces. Correlation analyses from both experiments showed that the magnitude of emotion judgment was correlated with b-CFS time only for familiar (upright-positive / own-race) but not unfamiliar (inverted-negative / other-race) faces. These results suggest that emotional content can be extracted under interocular suppression with familiar faces, and low-level properties in unfamiliar faces may play a major role in the b-CFS time.

pmid_8506341,Nouns and verbs are retrieved with differently distributed neural systems.,,"In a task designed to elicit the production of verbs, the patients known as AN-1033 and Boswell consistently produced the correct target words, performing no differently from normal controls. However, in a similar task designed to elicit the production of nouns, both patients performed quite defectively, and their scores were many SDs below those of controls. Language processing was otherwise normal--i.e., there were no impairments in grammar, morphology, phonetic implementation, or prosody; reading and writing were normal. In a third patient (KJ-1360), we obtained the reverse outcome--i.e., retrieval of common and proper nouns was preserved, but verb retrieval was defective. Together, the findings in the three patients constitute a double dissociation between noun and verb retrieval. In AN-1033 and Boswell, the lesions are located outside the so-called language areas (left frontoparietal operculum, posterior temporal region, inferior parietal lobule), where damage is associated with aphasia. The region of damage shared by the two patients is in left anterior and middle temporal lobe. This sector of left hemisphere contains systems for the retrieval of nouns that denote concrete entities. We propose that those systems are not essential for the retrieval of verbs and not involved in the vocal implementation of word forms. Those systems perform a two-way lexical-mediation role for concrete nouns and promote the reconstruction of a word form after the processing of sensory-motor characteristics of the entity denoted by that word. The findings in patient KJ-1360, whose lesion is in left premotor cortex, suggest that equivalent mediation systems for verbs are located in the left frontal region. ",
pmid_19395244,Delusions and dorso-medial frontal cortex volume in first-episode schizophrenia: a voxel-based morphometry study.,,"Of the few studies that have directly investigated the neuroanatomical correlates of delusions in patients with recent-onset schizophrenia, a number have paradoxically reported a positive correlation between delusion severity and regional grey matter volume. In order to explore this relationship, 31 patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FES) underwent a clinical interview and a T1-weighted structural MRI scan. Patients' scores on the Delusions subscale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale were correlated with the volume of every voxel in their grey matter images in SPM99. Patients' delusion scores were found to correlate with the volume of a cluster of voxels located in the dorso-medial frontal cortex, centred on the medial frontal gyrus. Post-hoc analysis revealed that this 'region-of-correlation' was volumetrically reduced in the FES patients relative to a group of 21 matched healthy controls. The results of this study support the hypothesis that while a certain level of structural brain atrophy is necessary for delusion formation in patients with FES, excessive structural atrophy may in fact preclude the formation of highly systematized delusions.

Type-2 diabetes mellitus","Rhythmic neural activity has been proposed to play a fundamental role in cognition. Both healthy and pathological aging are characterized by frequency-specific changes in oscillatory activity. However, the cognitive relevance of these changes across the spectrum from normal to pathological aging remains unknown. We examined electroencephalography (EEG) correlates of cognitive function in healthy aging and 2 of the most prominent and debilitating age-related disorders: type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Relative to healthy controls (HC), patients with AD were impaired on nearly every cognitive measure, whereas patients with T2DM performed worse mainly on learning and memory tests. A continuum of alterations in resting-state EEG was associated with pathological aging, generally characterized by reduced alpha (α) and beta (β) power (AD < T2DM < HC) and increased delta (δ) and theta (θ) power (AD > T2DM > HC), with some variations across different brain regions. There were also reductions in the frequency and power density of the posterior dominant rhythm in AD. The ratio of (α + β)/(δ + θ) was specifically associated with cognitive function in a domain- and diagnosis-specific manner. The results thus captured both similarities and differences in the pathophysiology of cerebral oscillations in T2DM and AD. Overall, pathological brain aging is marked by a shift in oscillatory power from higher to lower frequencies, which can be captured by a single cognitively relevant measure of the ratio of (α + β) over (δ + θ) power.

fMRI","Neuroscience research has thoroughly studied how nonliteral language is processed during metaphor comprehension. However, it is not clear how the brain actually creates nonliteral language. Therefore, the present study for the first time investigates the neural correlates of metaphor production. Participants completed sentences by generating novel metaphors or literal synonyms during functional imaging. Responses were spoken aloud in the scanner, recorded, and subsequently rated for their creative quality. We found that metaphor production was associated with focal activity in predominantly left-hemispheric brain regions, specifically the left angular gyrus, the left middle and superior frontal gyri-corresponding to the left dorsomedial prefrontal (DMPFC) cortex-and the posterior cingulate cortex. Moreover, brain activation in the left anterior DMPFC and the right middle temporal gyrus was found to linearly increase with the creative quality of metaphor responses. These findings are related to neuroscientific evidence on metaphor comprehension, creative idea generation and episodic future thought, suggesting that creating metaphors involves the flexible adaptation of semantic memory to imagine and construct novel figures of speech. Furthermore, the left DMPFC may exert executive control to maintain strategic search and selection, thus facilitating creativity of thought. ",
pmid_18667293,Functional MRI study of brain activation alterations in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder after symptom improvement.,,"Dysfunction of the frontal-subcortical circuits has been the most common finding in the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and recent neuropsychological studies have shown cognitive impairments in OCD. To clarify the pathophysiology of OCD without the confounding effects of medication, we investigated the alterations of brain function in OCD patients and changes after clinical improvement due solely to behavior therapy. The participants were 11 outpatients with OCD and 19 normal controls. The patients received 12 weeks of behavior therapy. We investigated the differences in the behavioral performance and functional magnetic resonance imaging results during the Stroop test in the patients and normal controls, and their changes after treatment in the patients. The patients showed less activation in the anterior cingulate gyrus and cerebellum than control subjects. Following significant improvement in OC symptoms, the cerebellum and parietal lobe showed increased activation, and the orbitofrontal cortex, middle frontal gyrus, and temporal regions showed decreased activation during the Stroop task, and performance of the task itself improved. Our findings suggest that dysfunction of the posterior brain regions, especially the cerebellum, is involved in the pathogenesis of OCD, and that normalization in function can occur with improvement of OC symptoms.

Participants divided money in a modified Dictator Game between themselves and people who previously either included or excluded them during a virtual ball-tossing game (Cyberball). Participants selectively punished the excluders by decreasing their outcomes; even when this required participants to give up monetary rewards. Punishment of excluders was associated with increased activation in the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) and bilateral anterior insula. Costly punishment was accompanied by higher activity in the pre-SMA compared with punishment that resulted in gains or was non-costly. Refraining from punishment (i.e. forgiveness) was associated with self-reported perspective-taking and increased activation in the bilateral temporoparietal junction, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings show that social exclusion can result in punishment as well as forgiveness of excluders and that separable neural networks implicated in social cognition and cognitive control are recruited when people choose either to punish or to forgive those who excluded them.

Twenty-eight healthy youths and 35 youths with DBD [high CU (HCU), n = 18; low CU (LCU), n = 17] performed the fMRI Affective Stroop task. Participants viewed positive, neutral, and negative images under varying levels of cognitive load. A 3-way ANOVA (group×emotion by task) was conducted on the BOLD response data. Youth with DBD-HCU showed significantly less activation of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and amygdala in response to negative stimuli, compared to healthy youth and youth with DBD-LCU. vmPFC responsiveness was inversely related to CU symptoms in DBD. Youth with DBD-LCU showed decreased functional connectivity between amygdala and regions including inferior frontal gyrus in response to emotional stimuli. Youth with DBD (LCU and HCU) additionally showed decreased insula responsiveness to high load (incongruent trials) compared to healthy youth. Insula responsiveness was inversely related to ADHD symptoms in DBD. These data reveal two forms of pathophysiology in DBD. One associated with reduced amygdala and vmPFC responses to negative stimuli and related to increased CU traits. Another associated with reduced insula responses during high load task trials and related to ADHD symptoms. Appropriate treatment will need to be individualized according to the patient's specific pathophysiology. ",

Neuroimaging","Neuroimaging research has characterized underlying neural mechanisms of attentional control and cognitive reappraisal, common implicit and explicit forms of emotion regulation, respectively. This research suggests attentional control and reappraisal may engage similar midline and lateral areas in the prefrontal cortex (PFC); however, findings are largely based on separate studies. Therefore, the extent to which mechanisms of implicit versus explicit regulation are independent or overlapping is not clear. In the current study, 49 healthy participants completed well-validated implicit and explicit regulation tasks in the form of attentional control and cognitive reappraisal during functional magnetic resonance imaging. During implicit regulation, participants identified a target letter in a string of letters superimposed on threatening faces. To manipulate attentional control, the letter string either consisted of all targets ('Threat Low' perceptual load), or was embedded among non-target letters ('Threat High' perceptual load). During cognitive reappraisal, participants were shown aversive images and instructed to use a cognitive approach to down-regulate negative affect ('Reappraise') or to naturally experience emotions without altering them ('Look-Negative'). Order of administration of tasks was counterbalanced across participants. Whole-brain results regarding frontal activity showed ventromedial PFC/rostral anterior cingulate cortex was recruited during Threat Low > Threat High. In contrast, Reappraise > Look-Negative resulted in engagement of the dorsolateral PFC, ventrolateral PFC and dorsomedial PFC. In addition, results showed no relationship between accuracy during attentional control and self-reported negative affect during cognitive reappraisal. Results indicate attentional control in the context of threat distractors and the reappraisal of negative images are supported by discrete, non-overlapping neurocircuitries. ",

oddball","Attentional problems in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have often been linked with deficits in cognitive control. Whether these deficits are associated with increased sensitivity to external salient stimuli remains unclear. To address this issue, we acquired functional brain images (fMRI) in 38 boys with and without ADHD (age: 11-16 years). To differentiate the effects of item novelty, contextual rareness and task relevance, participants performed a visual oddball task including four stimulus categories: a frequent standard picture (62.5%), unique novel pictures (12.5%), one repeated rare picture (12.5%), and a target picture (12.5%) that required a specific motor response. As a main finding, we can show considerable overlap in novelty-related BOLD responses between both groups, but only healthy participants showed neural deactivation in temporal as well as frontal regions in response to novel pictures. Furthermore, only ADHD patients, but not healthy controls, engaged wide parts of the novelty network when processing the rare but familiar picture. Our results provide first evidence that ADHD patients show enhanced neural activity in response to novel but behaviorally irrelevant stimuli as well as reduced habituation to familiar items. These findings suggest an inefficient use of neuronal resources in children with ADHD that could be closely linked to increased distractibility. ",

Here, we utilized passive music listening and fMRI to examine functional brain activation to a rewarding stimulus in 75 participants [healthy controls (HC), patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), frequent MJ users, and the combination of MDD and MJ (MDD + MJ)]. For each participant, a preferred and neutral piece of instrumental music was determined (utilizing ratings on a standardized scale), and each completed two 6-min fMRI scans of a passive music listening task. Data underwent pre-processing and 61 participants were carried forward for analysis (17 HC, 15 MDD, 15 MJ, 14 MDD + MJ). Two statistical analyses were performed using SPM8, an analysis of covariance with two factors (group × music type) and a whole brain, multiple regression analysis incorporating two predictors of interest [MJ use in past 28 days; and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score]. We identified a significant group × music type interaction. Post hoc comparisons showed that the preferred music had significantly greater activation in the MDD + MJ group in areas including the right middle and inferior frontal gyri extending into the claustrum and putamen and the anterior cingulate. No significant differences were identified in MDD, MJ, or HC groups. Multiple regression analysis showed that activation in medial frontal cortex was positively correlated with amount of MJ use, and activation in areas including the insula was negatively correlated with BDI score. Results showed modulation in brain activation during passive music listening specific to MDD, frequent MJ users. This supports the suggestion that frequent MJ use, when combined with MDD, is associated with changes in neurocircuitry involved in reward processing in ways that are absent with either frequent MJ use or MDD alone. This could help inform clinical recommendations for youth with MDD. ",
pmid_24822220,Selective changes of resting-state brain oscillations in aMCI: an fMRI study using ALFF.,,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) refers to a transitional state between normal aging and dementia and is a syndrome with cognitive decline greater than expected for an individual's age and educational level. As a subtype of MCI, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) most often leads to Alzheimer's disease. This study aims to elucidate the altered brain activation in patients with aMCI using resting-state functional magnetic resonance. We observed Frequency-dependent changes in the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in aMCI patients (n = 20), and normal subjects (n = 18). At the same time, we took gray matter volume as a covariate. We found that aMCI patients had decreased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation signal in left superior temporal gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, right inferior parietal lobe, and right postcentral gyrus compared to the control group. Specially, aMCI patients showed increased signal in left superior and middle frontal gyrus. Our results suggested that increased activation in frontal lobe of aMCI patients may indicate effective recruitment of compensatory brain resources. This finding and interpretation may lead to the better understanding of cognitive changes of aMCI. ",

Nucleus accumbens activation preceded risky choices as well as risk-seeking mistakes, while anterior insula activation preceded riskless choices as well as risk-aversion mistakes. These findings suggest that distinct neural circuits linked to anticipatory affect promote different types of financial choices and indicate that excessive activation of these circuits may lead to investing mistakes. Thus, consideration of anticipatory neural mechanisms may add predictive power to the rational actor model of economic decision making. ",
pmid_15339824,Changes in distributed neural circuitry function in patients with first-episode schizophrenia.,,"A number of functional brain abnormalities have been reported in schizophrenia, but it remains to be determined which of them represent trait and state markers of the illness. To delineate regional brain dysfunctions that remain stable and those that fluctuate during the course of schizophrenia. A cohort of patients with first-episode schizophrenia and a matched group of control participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging on two occasions 6-8 weeks apart during performance of a working memory task. The patients' disease was in partial remission at the second scan. Relative to control participants, the function of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left thalamus and right cerebellum remained disturbed in the people with schizophrenia, whereas the dysfunction of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, right thalamus, left cerebellum and cingulate gyrus normalised, with significant reduction in symptoms. These results suggest that dysfunction of the left fronto-thalamo-cerebellar circuitry is a relatively stable characteristic of schizophrenia, whereas disturbance of the right circuitry and cingulate gyrusis predominantly a state-related phenomenon.

Sunk cost effect","The sunk cost effect is the tendency to continue an investment, or take an action, even though it has higher future costs than benefits, if costs of time, money, or effort were previously incurred. This type of decision bias is pervasive in real life and has been studied in various disciplines. Previous studies and clinical observations suggest that decision-making under sunk costs is altered in gambling disorder (GD). However, the neural mechanisms of decision-making under sunk costs in GD remain largely unknown, and so is their association with the clinical characteristics of this patient group. Here, by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging and the task that demonstrated a clear example of the sunk cost effect, we investigated the neural correlates during decision-making under sunk costs in GD. We found no significant differences in the strength of the sunk cost effect between the GD and healthy control (HC) groups. However, the strength of the sunk cost effect in patients with GD showed a significant negative correlation with abstinence period and a marginally significant positive correlation with the duration of illness. We also found a reduction in the neural activation in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex during decision-making under sunk costs for the GD group compared with the HC group. Furthermore, in patients with GD, the levels of activation in this area negatively correlated with the duration of illness. These findings have important clinical implications. This study will contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying altered decision-making abilities in GD. ",

pmid_18356027,Abstinent adolescent marijuana users show altered fMRI response during spatial working memory.,,"Marijuana is the most widely used illicit substance among teenagers, yet little is known about the possible neural influence of heavy marijuana use during adolescence. We previously demonstrated an altered functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity related to spatial working memory (SWM) among adolescents who were heavy users of after an average of 8 days of abstinence, but the persisting neural effects remain unclear. To characterize the potentially persisting neurocognitive effects of heavy marijuana use in adolescence, we examined fMRI response during SWM among abstinent marijuana-using teens. Participants were 15 MJ teens and 17 demographically similar non-using controls, ages 16-18. Teens underwent biweekly urine toxicology screens to ensure abstinence for 28 days before fMRI acquisition. Groups performed similarly on the SWM task, but MJ teens demonstrated lower activity in right dorsolateral prefrontal and occipital cortices, yet significantly more activation in right posterior parietal cortex. MJ teens showed abnormalities in brain response during a SWM task compared with controls, even after 1 month of abstinence. The activation pattern among MJ teens may reflect different patterns of utilization of spatial rehearsal and attention strategies, and could indicate altered neurodevelopment or persisting abnormalities associated with heavy marijuana use in adolescence.

pmid_15028641,"Task-independent and task-specific age effects on brain activity during working memory, visual attention and episodic retrieval.",,"It is controversial whether the effects of aging on various cognitive functions have the same common cause or several different causes. To investigate this issue, we scanned younger and older adults with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing three different tasks: working memory, visual attention and episodic retrieval. There were three main results. First, in all three tasks, older adults showed weaker occipital activity and stronger prefrontal and parietal activity than younger adults. The occipital reduction is consistent with the view that sensory processing decline is a common cause in cognitive aging, and the prefrontal increase may reflect functional compensation. Secondly, older adults showed more bilateral patterns of prefrontal activity than younger adults during working memory and visual attention tasks. These findings are consistent with the Hemispheric Asymmetry Reduction in Older Adults (HAROLD) model. Finally, compared to younger adults, older adults showed weaker hippocampal formation activity in all three tasks but stronger parahippocampal activity in the episodic retrieval task. The former finding suggests that age-related hippocampal deficits may have a global effect in cognition, and the latter is consistent with an age-related increase in familiarity-based recognition. Taken together, the results indicate that both common and specific factors play an important role in cognitive aging. ",
pmid_18485743,Subcortical processes of motor response inhibition during a stop signal task.,,"Previous studies have delineated the neural processes of motor response inhibition during a stop signal task, with most reports focusing on the cortical mechanisms. A recent study highlighted the importance of subcortical processes during stop signal inhibition in 13 individuals and suggested that the subthalamic nucleus (STN) may play a role in blocking response execution (Aron and Poldrack, 2006. Cortical and subcortical contributions to Stop signal response inhibition: role of the subthalamic nucleus. J Neurosci 26, 2424-2433). Here in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study we replicated the finding of greater activation in the STN during stop (success or error) trials, compared to go trials, in a larger sample of subjects (n=30). However, since a contrast between stop and go trials involved processes that could be distinguished from response inhibition, the role of subthalamic activity during stop signal inhibition remained to be specified. To this end we followed an alternative strategy to isolate the neural correlates of response inhibition (Li et al., 2006a. Imaging response inhibition in a stop signal task--neural correlates independent of signal monitoring and post-response processing. J Neurosci 26, 186-192). We compared individuals with short and long stop signal reaction time (SSRT) as computed by the horse race model. The two groups of subjects did not differ in any other aspects of stop signal performance. We showed greater activity in the short than the long SSRT group in the caudate head during stop successes, as compared to stop errors. Caudate activity was positively correlated with medial prefrontal activity previously shown to mediate stop signal inhibition. Conversely, bilateral thalamic nuclei and other parts of the basal ganglia, including the STN, showed greater activation in subjects with long than short SSRT. Thus, fMRI delineated contrasting roles of the prefrontal-caudate and striato-thalamic activities in mediating motor response inhibition. ",
pmid_19580391,Temporal aspects of the feeling of familiarity for music and the emergence of conceptual processing.,,"We tested whether the emergence of familiarity to a melody may trigger or co-occur with the processing of the concept(s) conveyed by emotions to, or semantic association with, the melody. With this objective, we recorded ERPs while participants were presented with highly familiar and less familiar melodies in a gating paradigm. The ERPs time locked to a tone of the melody called the ""familiarity emergence point"" showed a larger fronto-central negativity for highly familiar compared with less familiar melodies between 200 and 500 msec, with a peak latency around 400 msec. This latency and the sensitivity to the degree of familiarity/conceptual information suggest that this component was an N400, a marker of conceptual processing. Our data suggest that the feeling of familiarity evoked by a musical excerpt could be accompanied by other processing mechanisms at the conceptual level. Coupling the gating paradigm with ERP analyses might become a new avenue for investigating the neurocognitive basis of implicit musical knowledge. ",

Therefore, how to determine the possibility of developing into schizophrenia individuals before the onset of the diseases are particularly important. The study investigated cerebral gray matter volume differences and resting-state functional connections among patients with psychosis risk syndrome (PRS), patients with first-episode schizophrenic (FES), and healthy controls (HC), aiming to provide scientific clinical evidence for schizophrenia early identification and intervention. A total of 19 PRS patients, 18 FES patients, and 29 HC were recruited. Gray matter volume and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) during resting-state functional studies were measured. Comparison of gray matter volumes showed that PRS and FES groups had common reduced gray matter volume in the right caudate. PRS and FES patients showed altered connectivity mainly in the semantic processing-related brain areas. fALFF analysis found that PRF and FES patients had significant differences in fALFF values of the brain region mainly located in the subcortical network, visual recognition network, and auditory network. In addition, PRF individuals had a higher fALFF value and a lower fALFF value in the anterior wedge of the cerebral network than the HC group. Gray matter volume loss between related brain areas might appear prior to illness onset. Similar fALFF values occurred in PRS and FES groups indicated that multiple brain regions of neuronal activity abnormalities and unconventional neural network mechanism have been existed in PRS patients.

Seventy-two MwoA patients and forty-six HS were recruited. 3D-T1 and resting state fMRI data were collected during the interictal period for MwoA and HS. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) for structure analysis and regional homogeneity (Reho) for fMRI analysis were applied. The VBM and Reho maps were overlapped to determine a possible brain region with concurrent functional and structural alteration in MwoA patients. Further analysis of resting state functional connectivity (FC) alteration was applied with this brain region as the seed. Compared with HS, MwoA patients showed decreased volume in the bilateral superior and inferior colliculus, periaqueductal gray matter (PAG), locus ceruleus, median raphe nuclei (MRN) and dorsal pons medulla junction. MwoA patients showed decreased Reho values in the middle occipital gyrus and inferior occipital gyrus, and increased Reho values in the MRN. Only a region in the MRN showed both structural and functional alteration in MwoA patients. Pearson correlation analysis showed that there was no association between volume or Reho values of the MRN and headache frequency, headache intensity, disease duration, self-rating anxiety scale or self-rating depression scale in MwoA patients. Resting state functional connectivity (FC) with the MRN as the seed showed that MwoA patients had increased FC between the MRN and PAG.

pmid_17689571,"Functional anatomy of visuo-spatial working memory during mental rotation is influenced by sex, menstrual cycle, and sex steroid hormones.",,"Recent observations indicate that sex and level of steroid hormones may influence cortical networks associated with specific cognitive functions, in particular visuo-spatial abilities. The present study probed the influence of sex, menstrual cycle, and sex steroid hormones on 3D mental rotation and brain function using 3-T fMRI. Twelve healthy women and 12 men were investigated. Menstrual cycle and hormone levels were assessed. The early follicular and midluteal phase of the menstrual cycle were chosen to examine short-term cyclical changes. Parietal and frontal areas were activated during mental rotation in both sexes. Significant differences between men and women were revealed in both phases of menstrual cycle. In men we observed a significant correlation of activation levels with testosterone levels in the left parietal lobe (BA 40). In women, a cycle-dependent correlation pattern was observed for testosterone: brain activation correlated with this male hormone only during the early follicular phase. In both cycle phases females' brain activation was significantly correlated with estradiol in frontal and parietal areas. Our study provides evidence that fMRI-related activity during performance of cognitive tasks varies across sex and phases of the menstrual cycle. The variation might be partly explained by better task performance in men, but our results indicate that further explanations like basic neuronal or neurovascular effects modulated by steroid hormones must be considered. Both estradiol and testosterone levels may influence fMRI signals of cognitive tasks, which should affect selection of subjects for future fMRI studies. ",
pmid_18785653,Brain response to complex visual stimuli in Parkinson's patients with hallucinations: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study.,,"Visual hallucinations (VH) in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been associated with gray matter reductions in visual associative areas and with abnormal patterns of brain activation in posterior and frontal regions. However, all previous fMRI studies have used simple visual stimuli. The objective of our study was, therefore, to compare the pattern of brain activation during a one-back face detection task. We examined 10 PD patients with VH, 10 PD patients without VH, and 10 controls matched for age and education. The fMRI task consisted in three blocks of 21-face stimuli (activation condition) and three blocks of 21-colored mosaics (control condition). Subjects were asked to press a key when two identical stimuli were presented consecutively. During the face condition, compared with patients without VH, hallucinating PD patients showed significant reductions in the activation of several right prefrontal areas, such as the inferior (BA 10,47), superior (BA 6/8), middle frontal (BA 8), and anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 31/32). In the control condition, we found a hyperactivation in the hallucinating PD sample compared with the nonVH patients in the right inferior frontal gyrus. A dysfunction of the frontal areas associated with the control of attention could predispose to VH through an abnormal processing of relevant and irrelevant visual stimuli. ",

neuropsychiatric symptoms","Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), such as apathy and depression, commonly accompany cognitive and functional decline in early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Prior studies have shown associations between affective NPS and neurodegeneration of medial frontal and inferior temporal regions in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD dementia. To investigate the association between functional connectivity in four brain networks and NPS in elderly with MCI. NPS were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory in 42 subjects with MCI. Resting-state functional connectivity in four networks (default mode network, fronto-parietal control network (FPCN), dorsal attention network, and ventral attention network) was assessed using seed-based magnetic resonance imaging. Factor analysis was used to identify two factors of NPS: Affective and Hyperactivity. Linear regression models were utilized with the neuropsychiatric factors as the dependent variable and the four networks as the predictors of interest. Covariates included age, gender, premorbid intelligence, processing speed, memory, head movement, and signal-to-noise ratio. These analyses were repeated with the individual items of the affective factor, using the same predictors. There was a significant association between greater Affective factor symptoms and reduced FPCN connectivity (p = 0.03). There was no association between the Hyperactivity factor and any of the networks. Secondary analyses revealed an association between greater apathy and reduced FPCN connectivity (p = 0.005), but none in other networks. Decreased connectivity in the FPCN may be associated with greater affective symptoms, particularly apathy, early in AD. These findings extend prior studies, using different functional imaging modalities in individuals with greater disease severity. ",
pmid_15050549,Activation of the amygdala and anterior cingulate during nonconscious processing of sad versus happy faces.,,"Previous functional neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that the amygdala activates in response to fearful faces presented below the threshold of conscious visual perception. Using a backward masking procedure similar to that of previous studies, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the amygdala and anterior cingulate gyrus during preattentive presentations of sad and happy facial affect. Twelve healthy adult females underwent blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI while viewing sad and happy faces, each presented for 20 ms and ""masked"" immediately by a neutral face for 100 ms. Masked happy faces were associated with significant bilateral activation within the anterior cingulate gyrus and amygdala, whereas masked sadness yielded only limited activation within the left anterior cingulate gyrus. In a direct comparison, masked happy faces yielded significantly greater activation in the anterior cingulate and amygdala relative to identically masked sad faces. Conjunction analysis showed that masked affect perception, regardless of emotional valence, was associated with greater activation within the left amygdala and left anterior cingulate. Findings suggest that the amygdala and anterior cingulate are important components of a network involved in detecting and discriminating affective information presented below the normal threshold of conscious visual perception.

pmid_19159691,Expectancy and treatment interactions: a dissociation between acupuncture analgesia and expectancy evoked placebo analgesia.,,"Recent advances in placebo research have demonstrated the mind's power to alter physiology. In this study, we combined an expectancy manipulation model with both verum and sham acupuncture treatments to address: 1) how and to what extent treatment and expectancy effects - including both subjective pain intensity levels (pain sensory ratings) and objective physiological activations (fMRI) - interact; and 2) if the underlying mechanism of expectancy remains the same whether placebo treatment is given alone or in conjunction with active treatment. The results indicate that although verum acupuncture+high expectation and sham acupuncture+high expectation induced subjective reports of analgesia of equal magnitude, fMRI analysis showed that verum acupuncture produced greater fMRI signal decrease in pain related brain regions during application of calibrated heat pain stimuli on the right arm. We believe our study provides brain imaging evidence for the existence of different mechanisms underlying acupuncture analgesia and expectancy evoked placebo analgesia. Our results also suggest that the brain network involved in expectancy may vary under different treatment situations (verum and sham acupuncture treatment). ",
pmid_21079814,On the role of the striatum in response inhibition.,,"Stopping a manual response requires suppression of the primary motor cortex (M1) and has been linked to activation of the striatum. Here, we test three hypotheses regarding the role of the striatum in stopping: striatum activation during successful stopping may reflect suppression of M1, anticipation of a stop-signal occurring, or a slower response build-up. Twenty-four healthy volunteers underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a stop-signal paradigm, in which anticipation of stopping was manipulated using a visual cue indicating stop-signal probability, with their right hand. We observed activation of the striatum and deactivation of left M1 during successful versus unsuccessful stopping. In addition, striatum activation was proportional to the degree of left M1 deactivation during successful stopping, implicating the striatum in response suppression. Furthermore, striatum activation increased as a function of stop-signal probability and was to linked to activation in the supplementary motor complex (SMC) and right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) during successful stopping, suggesting a role in anticipation of stopping. Finally, trial-to-trial variations in response time did not affect striatum activation. The results identify the striatum as a critical node in the neural network associated with stopping motor responses. As striatum activation was related to both suppression of M1 and anticipation of a stop-signal occurring, these findings suggest that the striatum is involved in proactive inhibitory control over M1, most likely in interaction with SMC and rIFC.

The aim of this study was to investigate the (neurobiological) link among childhood trauma, state anxiety, and amygdala-frontostriatal activity in response to cocaine cues in regular cocaine users. In this study, we included 59 non-treatment seeking regular cocaine users and 58 non-drug using controls. Blood oxygenation level-dependent responses were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging while subjects performed a cue reactivity paradigm with cocaine and neutral cues. Psychophysiological interaction analyses were applied to assess functional connectivity between the amygdala and other regions in the brain. Self-report questionnaires were used to measure childhood trauma, state anxiety, drug use, drug use severity, and craving. Neural activation was increased during the presentation of cocaine cues, in a widespread network including the frontostriatal circuit and amygdala in cocaine users but not in controls. Functional coupling between the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex was reduced in response to cocaine cues, in both cocaine users and controls, which was further diminished with increasing state anxiety. Importantly, amygdala-striatal connectivity was positively associated with childhood trauma in regular cocaine users, while there was a negative association in controls. At the behavioral level, state anxiety was positively associated with cocaine use severity and craving related to negative reinforcement. Childhood trauma is associated with enhanced amygdala-striatal connectivity during cocaine cue reactivity in regular cocaine users, which may contribute to increased habit behavior and poorer cognitive control. While we cannot draw conclusions on causality, this study provides novel information on how childhood trauma may contribute to the development and persistence of cocaine use disorder. ",
pmid_19501658,Traditional Chinese acupuncture and placebo (sham) acupuncture are differentiated by their effects on mu-opioid receptors (MORs).,,"Controversy remains regarding the mechanisms of acupuncture analgesia. A prevailing theory, largely unproven in humans, is that it involves the activation of endogenous opioid antinociceptive systems and mu-opioid receptors (MORs). This is also a neurotransmitter system that mediates the effects of placebo-induced analgesia. This overlap in potential mechanisms may explain the lack of differentiation between traditional acupuncture and either non-traditional or sham acupuncture in multiple controlled clinical trials. We compared both short- and long-term effects of traditional Chinese acupuncture (TA) versus sham acupuncture (SA) treatment on in vivo MOR binding availability in chronic pain patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia (FM). Patients were randomized to receive either TA or SA treatment over the course of 4 weeks. Positron emission tomography (PET) with (11)C-carfentanil was performed once during the first treatment session and then repeated a month later following the eighth treatment. Acupuncture therapy evoked short-term increases in MOR binding potential, in multiple pain and sensory processing regions including the cingulate (dorsal and subgenual), insula, caudate, thalamus, and amygdala. Acupuncture therapy also evoked long-term increases in MOR binding potential in some of the same structures including the cingulate (dorsal and perigenual), caudate, and amygdala. These short- and long-term effects were absent in the sham group where small reductions were observed, an effect more consistent with previous placebo PET studies. Long-term increases in MOR BP following TA were also associated with greater reductions in clinical pain. These findings suggest that divergent MOR processes may mediate clinically relevant analgesic effects for acupuncture and sham acupuncture. ",
pmid_16002029,fMRI response to spatial working memory in adolescents with comorbid marijuana and alcohol use disorders.,,"Alcohol and marijuana use are prevalent in adolescence, yet the neural impact of concomitant use remains unclear. We previously demonstrated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) response to spatial working memory (SWM) among teens with alcohol use disorders (AUD) compared to controls, and predicted that adolescents with marijuana and alcohol use disorders would show additional abnormalities. Participants were three groups of 15-17-year-olds: 19 non-abusing controls, 15 AUD teens with limited exposure to drugs, and 15 teens with comorbid marijuana and alcohol use disorders (MAUD) and minimal other drug experience. After >2 days' abstinence, participants performed a SWM task during fMRI acquisition. fMRI brain response patterns differed between groups, despite similar performance on the task. MAUD youths showed less activation in inferior frontal and temporal regions than controls, and more response in other prefrontal regions. Compared to AUD teens, MAUD youths also showed less inferior frontal and temporal activation, but more medial frontal response. Overall, MAUD youths showed different brain response abnormalities than teens with AUD alone, despite relatively short histories of substance involvement. This pattern could suggest compensation for marijuana-related attention and working memory deficits. However, relatively recent use and premorbid features may influence results, and should be examined in future studies. ",
pmid_19580877,Sex-dependent age modulation of frontostriatal and temporo-parietal activation during cognitive control.,,"Developmental functional imaging studies of cognitive control show progressive age-related increase in task-relevant fronto-striatal activation in male development from childhood to adulthood. Little is known, however, about how gender affects this functional development. In this study, we used event related functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine effects of sex, age, and their interaction on brain activation during attentional switching and interference inhibition, in 63 male and female adolescents and adults, aged 13 to 38. Linear age correlations were observed across all subjects in task-specific frontal, striatal and temporo-parietal activation. Gender analysis revealed increased activation in females relative to males in fronto-striatal areas during the Switch task, and laterality effects in the Simon task, with females showing increased left inferior prefrontal and temporal activation, and males showing increased right inferior prefrontal and parietal activation. Increased prefrontal activation clusters in females and increased parietal activation clusters in males furthermore overlapped with clusters that were age-correlated across the whole group, potentially reflecting more mature prefrontal brain activation patterns for females, and more mature parietal activation patterns for males. Gender by age interactions further supported this dissociation, revealing exclusive female-specific age correlations in inferior and medial prefrontal brain regions during both tasks, and exclusive male-specific age correlations in superior parietal (Switch task) and temporal regions (Simon task). These findings show increased recruitment of age-correlated prefrontal activation in females, and of age-correlated parietal activation in males, during tasks of cognitive control. Gender differences in frontal and parietal recruitment may thus be related to gender differences in the neurofunctional maturation of these brain regions. ",
pmid_22306803,Interaction of COMT val158met and externalizing behavior: relation to prefrontal brain activity and behavioral performance.,,"A promising approach in neuroimaging studies aimed at understanding effects of single genetic variants on behavior is the study of gene-trait interactions. Variation in the catechol-O-methyl-transferase gene (COMT) is associated with the regulation of dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex and with cognitive functioning. Given the involvement of dopaminergic neurotransmission in externalizing behavior, a trait characterized by impulsivity and aggression, especially in men, externalizing (as a trait) may index a set of genetic, environmental, and neural characteristics pertinent to understanding phenotypic effects of genetic variation in the COMT gene. In the current study, we used a gene-trait approach to investigate effects of the COMT val(158)met polymorphism and externalizing on brain activity during moments involving low or high demands on cognitive control. In 104 male participants, interference-related activation depended conjointly on externalizing and val(158)met: stronger activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate and lateral prefrontal cortex was found for val/val individuals with high trait externalizing while stronger activation in cingulate motor areas and sensorimotor precuneus was found for met/met individuals with low externalizing. Our results suggest that the val/val genotype, coupled with high levels of trait externalizing, lowers the efficiency of stimulus conflict resolution, whereas the met/met genotype, coupled with low levels of externalizing, lowers the efficiency of response selection.

However, despite clinical differences in their responses to food, differential neural activation to thinking about eating food, between women with anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) is not known. We compare 50 women (8 with BN, 18 with AN and 24 age-matched healthy controls [HC]) while they view food images during functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). In response to food (vs non-food) images, women with BN showed greater neural activation in the visual cortex, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, right insular cortex and precentral gyrus, women with AN showed greater activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, cerebellum and right precuneus. HC women activated the cerebellum, right insular cortex, right medial temporal lobe and left caudate. Direct comparisons revealed that compared to HC, the BN group showed relative deactivation in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus/insula, and visual cortex, and compared to AN had relative deactivation in the parietal lobe and dorsal posterior cingulate cortex, but greater activation in the caudate, superior temporal gyrus, right insula and supplementary motor area. Women with AN and BN activate top-down cognitive control in response to food images, yet women with BN have increased activation in reward and somatosensory regions, which might impinge on cognitive control over food consumption and binge eating.

Pain modulation","Granger causality analysis (GCA) has been used to investigate the pathophysiology of migraine. Amygdala plays a key role in pain modulation of migraine attack. However, the detailed neuromechanism remained to be elucidated. We applied GCA to explore the amygdala-based directional effective connectivity in migraine without aura (MwoA) and to determine the relation with clinical characteristics. Forty-five MwoA patients and forty age-, sex-, and years of education-matched healthy controls(HCs) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Bilateral amygdala were used as seed regions in GCA to investigate directional effective connectivity and relation with migraine duration or attack frequency. MwoA patients showed significantly decreased effective connectivity from right amygdala to right superior temporal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus and right precentral gyrus compared with HCs. Furthermore, MwoA patients demonstrated significantly decreased effective connectivity from the left amygdala to the ipsilateral superior temporal gyrus. Also, MwoA patients showed enhanced effective connectivity from left inferior frontal gyrus to left amygdala. Effective connectivity outflow from right amygdala to right precentral gyrus was negatively correlated to disease duration. Altered directional effective connectivity of amygdala demonstrated that neurolimbic pain networks contribute to multisensory integration abnormalities and deficits in pain modulation of MwoA patients.

pmid_23638070,The congruency effect in the posterior medial frontal cortex is more consistent with time on task than with response conflict.,,"The posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) is thought to play a pivotal role in enabling the control of attention during periods of distraction. In line with this view, pMFC activity is ubiquitously greater in incongruent trials of response-interference (e.g., Stroop) tasks than in congruent trials. Nonetheless, the process underlying this congruency effect remains highly controversial. We therefore sought to distinguish between two competing accounts of the congruency effect. The conflict monitoring account posits the effect indexes a process that detects conflict between competing response alternatives, which is indexed by trial-specific reaction time (RT). The time on task account posits the effect indexes a process whose recruitment increases with time on task independent of response conflict (e.g., sustained attention, arousal, effort, etc.). To distinguish between these accounts, we used functional MRI to record brain activity in twenty-four healthy adults while they performed two tasks: a response-interference task and a simple RT task with only one possible response. We reasoned that demands on a process that detects response conflict should increase with RT in the response-interference task but not in the simple RT task. In contrast, demands on a process whose recruitment increases with time on task independent of response conflict should increase with RT in both tasks. Trial-by-trial analyses revealed that pMFC activity increased with RT in both tasks. Moreover, pMFC activity increased with RT in the simple RT task enough to fully account for the congruency effect in the response-interference task. These findings appear more consistent with the time on task account of the congruency effect than with the conflict monitoring account. ",
pmid_35126799,Decreased Gray Matter Volume in the Frontal Cortex of Migraine Patients with Associated Functional Connectivity Alterations: A VBM and rs-FC Study.,,"Resting-state functional MRI is widely used in migraine research. However, the pathophysiology and imaging markers specific for migraine pathologies are not well understood. In this study, we combined both structural and functional images to explore the concurrence and process of migraines. Thirty-four patients with a history of migraine without aura presenting during the interictal period (MwoA-DI), 10 patients with migraine without aura presenting during the acute attack (MwoA-DA), and 32 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited in this study. All participants underwent scanning via MRI. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) analysis were used to detect the brain structural and associated brain functional connectivity. In VBM analysis, a decrease of gray matter volume (GMV) in the middle frontal cortex was found in MwoA patients compared with HCs. The GMV of the middle frontal cortex had a negative correction with the duration of disease. In rs-FC analysis, the left middle frontal cortex (lower, VBM result) in both the MwoA-DA and the HC groups showed significantly increased functional connectivity with the left middle frontal cortex (upper) and left superior frontal cortex compared with MwoA-DI. The left middle frontal cortex (lower) in the MwoA-DI group also showed decreased functional connectivity in the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) compared with the HC group. The left middle frontal cortex (lower) in the MwoA-DA group demonstrated significantly increased functional connectivity in the left cerebellum lobule VI compared with the HC group. Our results demonstrated that the middle frontal cortex may serve as an important target in the frequency and severity of migraines due to its role in pain regulation through the default mode network, especially in the PCC. In addition, the cerebellum may modulate the pathophysiology of migraines by serving as a communication point between the cortex and the brainstem. ",
pmid_11522264,Evidence of abnormal amygdala functioning in borderline personality disorder: a functional MRI study.,,"Intense and rapidly changing mood states are a major feature of borderline personality disorder (BPD); however, there have only been a few studies investigating affective processing in BPD, and in particular no neurofunctional correlates of abnormal emotional processing have been identified so far. Six female BPD patients without additional major psychiatric disorder and six age-matched female control subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure regional cerebral hemodynamic changes following brain activity when viewing 12 standardized emotionally aversive slides compared to 12 neutral slides, which were presented in random order. Our main finding was that BPD subjects but not control subjects were characterized by an elevated blood oxygenation level dependent fMRI signal in the amygdala on both sides. In addition, activation of the medial and inferolateral prefrontal cortex was seen in BPD patients. Both groups showed activation in the temporo-occipital cortex including the fusiform gyrus in BPD subjects but not in control subjects. Enhanced amygdala activation in BPD is suggested to reflect the intense and slowly subsiding emotions commonly observed in response to even low-level stressors. Borderline subjects' perceptual cortex may be modulated through the amygdala leading to increased attention to emotionally relevant environmental stimuli. ",
pmid_21811568,Functional disconnection and compensation in mild cognitive impairment: evidence from DLPFC connectivity using resting-state fMRI.,,"The known regional abnormality of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and its role in various neural circuits in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has given prominence to its importance in studies on the disconnection associated with MCI. The purpose of the current study was to examine the DLPFC functional connectivity patterns during rest in MCI patients and the impact of regional grey matter (GM) atrophy on the functional results. Structural and functional MRI data were collected from 14 MCI patients and 14 age, gender-matched healthy controls. We found that both the bilateral DLPFC showed reduced functional connectivity with the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), superior/medial frontal gyrus and sub-cortical regions (e.g., thalamus, putamen) in MCI patients when compared with healthy controls. Moreover, the DLPFC connectivity with the IPL and thalamus significantly correlated with the cognitive performance of patients as measured by mini-mental state examination (MMSE), clock drawing test (CDT), and California verbal learning test (CVLT) scores. When taking GM atrophy as covariates, these results were approximately consistent with those without correction, although there may be a decrease in the statistical power. These results suggest that the DLPFC disconnections may be the substrates of cognitive impairments in MCI patients. In addition, we also found enhanced functional connectivity between the left DLPFC and the right prefrontal cortex in MCI patients. This is consistent with previous findings of MCI-related increased activation during cognitive tasks, and may represent a compensatory mechanism in MCI patients. Together, the present study demonstrated the coexistence of functional disconnection and compensation in MCI patients using DLPFC functional connectivity analysis, and thus might provide insights into biological mechanism of the disease.

pmid_17850833,Meta-analysis of Go/No-go tasks demonstrating that fMRI activation associated with response inhibition is task-dependent.,,"FMRI studies of response inhibition consistently reveal frontal lobe activation. Localization within the frontal cortex, however, varies across studies and appears dependent on the nature of the task. Activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analysis is a powerful quantitative method of establishing concurrence of activation across functional neuroimaging studies. For this study, ALE was used to investigate concurrent neural correlates of successfully inhibited No-go stimuli across studies of healthy adults performing a Go/No-go task, a paradigm frequently used to measure response inhibition. Due to the potential overlap of neural circuits for response selection and response inhibition, the analysis included only event-related studies contrasting No-go activation with baseline, which allowed for inclusion of all regions that may be critical to visually guided motor response inhibition, including those involved in response selection. These Go/No-go studies were then divided into two groups: ""simple"" Go/No-go tasks in which the No-go stimulus was always the same, and ""complex"" Go/No-go tasks, in which the No-go stimulus changed depending on context, requiring frequent updating of stimulus-response associations in working memory. The simple and complex tasks demonstrated distinct patterns of concurrence, with right dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior parietal circuits recruited under conditions of increased working memory demand. Common to both simple and complex Go/No-go tasks was concurrence in the pre-SMA and the left fusiform gyrus. As the pre-SMA has also been shown to be involved in response selection, the results support the notion that the pre-SMA is critical for selection of appropriate behavior, whether selecting to execute an appropriate response or selecting to inhibit an inappropriate response.

pmid_27092470,Impaired anterior insular activation during risky decision making in young adults with internet gaming disorder.,,"Internet gaming disorder is defined as excessive and compulsive use of the internet to engage in games that leads to clinically significant psychosocial impairment. We tested the hypothesis that individuals with internet gaming disorder would be less sensitive to high-risk situations and show aberrant brain activation related to risk prediction processing. Young adults with internet gaming disorder underwent functional MRI while performing a risky decision-making task. The healthy control group showed stronger activations within the dorsal attention network and the anterior insular cortex, which were not found in the internet gaming disorder group. Our findings imply that young adults with internet gaming disorder show impaired anterior insular activation during risky decision making, which might make them vulnerable when they need to adapt new behavioral strategies in high-risk situations. ",
pmid_17239618,Load response functions in the human spatial working memory circuit during location memory updating.,,"Previous studies have emphasized that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is important for manipulating information in working memory, although activations in other frontal and parietal areas are commonly observed under the same conditions. We conducted an fMRI experiment to examine brain responses as a parametric function of memory updating, which is considered as an elemental process in working memory. In a variant spatial delayed-response task, human subjects performed updating operations over a 9-second delay period, during which they mentally transform the location of a memorized target in a 4 by 4 grid according to 3 to 12 instruction cues. Activity increased monotonically with increasing updating load in numerous cortical and subcortical regions including the rostrodorsal premotor (rdPM), lateral precentral sulcus, lateral prefrontal, posterior associative, striatal and cerebellar areas. The rdPM and superior parietal were particularly sensitive to the updating manipulation. There were several main findings. First, updating spatial working memory involved mostly the same cortical and subcortical regions that were activated during maintenance of spatial information. Second, the updating load response functions of regions in the spatial working memory circuit showed a strong linear component. However, none shows significant increases in activity from 9 to 12 updating operations. Third, activity in the right rdPM and anterior inferior frontal gyrus correlated positively with working memory performance in the high updating load condition. Our findings suggest that updating and maintenance of spatial information may share similar processes and that the rostrodorsal premotor cortex and anterior inferior frontal gyrus may be important for the success of tracking spatial information in working memory.

pmid_26435254,Habitual suppression relates to difficulty in regulating emotion with cognitive reappraisal.,"Affective disorder
Cognitive reappraisal
Gender difference
Habitual suppression","One common strategy to cope with the difficulties of daily life is suppression. Habitual users of suppression tend to suppress their feelings rather than expressing them. Although this strategy may reduce outward response to emotion, it is not thought to lessen induced negative affect. Moreover, it remains unclear whether people with high suppression scores can reduce negative affect through cognitive reappraisal. In the present study, twenty-nine healthy participants differing in suppression scores were directed to reappraise aversive stimuli during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results showed that higher suppression scores correlated with decreased response of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) during cognitive reappraisal. Further, high suppression scores related to enhanced negative affect to stimuli with greater negative affect correlating with decreased dmPFC response during cognitive reappraisal. This study suggests that people with high suppression scores experience difficulty in reducing negative affect through cognitive reappraisal and implicates neurobiological processes that may underlie this difficulty.

pmid_22101112,A systematic review and meta-analysis of the fMRI investigation of autism spectrum disorders.,,Recent years have seen a rapid increase in the investigation of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We carried out a systematic review and ALE meta-analysis of fMRI studies of ASD. A disturbance to the function of social brain regions is among the most well replicated finding. Differences in social brain activation may relate to a lack of preference for social stimuli as opposed to a primary dysfunction of these regions. Increasing evidence points towards a lack of effective integration of distributed functional brain regions and disruptions in the subtle modulation of brain function in relation to changing task demands in ASD. Limitations of the literature to date include the use of small sample sizes and the restriction of investigation to primarily high functioning males with autism. ,
pmid_23029031,Patterns of spontaneous brain activity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a resting-state FMRI study.,,"By detecting spontaneous low-frequency fluctuations (LFF) of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rfMRI) measurements are believed to reflect spontaneous cerebral neural activity. Previous fMRI studies were focused on the examination of motor-related areas and little is known about the functional changes in the extra-motor areas in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. The aim of this study is to investigate functional cerebral abnormalities in ALS patients on a whole brain scale. Twenty ALS patients and twenty age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were enrolled. Voxel-based analysis was used to characterize the alteration of amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF). Compared with the controls, the ALS patients showed significantly decreased ALFF in the visual cortex, fusiform gyri and right postcentral gyrus; and significantly increased ALFF in the left medial frontal gyrus, and in right inferior frontal areas after grey matter (GM) correction. Taking GM volume as covariates, the ALFF results were approximately consistent with those without GM correction. In addition, ALFF value in left medial frontal gyrus was negatively correlated with the rate of disease progression and duration. Decreased functional activity observed in the present study indicates the underlying deficits of the sensory processing system in ALS. Increased functional activity points to a compensatory mechanism. Our findings suggest that ALS is a multisystem disease other than merely motor dysfunction and provide evidence that alterations of ALFF in the frontal areas may be a special marker of ALS. ",
pmid_19854279,Musical and verbal semantic memory: two distinct neural networks?,,"Semantic memory has been investigated in numerous neuroimaging and clinical studies, most of which have used verbal or visual, but only very seldom, musical material. Clinical studies have suggested that there is a relative neural independence between verbal and musical semantic memory. In the present study, ""musical semantic memory"" is defined as memory for ""well-known"" melodies without any knowledge of the spatial or temporal circumstances of learning, while ""verbal semantic memory"" corresponds to general knowledge about concepts, again without any knowledge of the spatial or temporal circumstances of learning. Our aim was to compare the neural substrates of musical and verbal semantic memory by administering the same type of task in each modality. We used high-resolution PET H(2)O(15) to observe 11 young subjects performing two main tasks: (1) a musical semantic memory task, where the subjects heard the first part of familiar melodies and had to decide whether the second part they heard matched the first, and (2) a verbal semantic memory task with the same design, but where the material consisted of well-known expressions or proverbs. The musical semantic memory condition activated the superior temporal area and inferior and middle frontal areas in the left hemisphere and the inferior frontal area in the right hemisphere. The verbal semantic memory condition activated the middle temporal region in the left hemisphere and the cerebellum in the right hemisphere. We found that the verbal and musical semantic processes activated a common network extending throughout the left temporal neocortex. In addition, there was a material-dependent topographical preference within this network, with predominantly anterior activation during musical tasks and predominantly posterior activation during semantic verbal tasks.

pmid_23273724,A treatment-resistant default mode subnetwork in major depression.,,"Previous studies have suggested that the default mode network (DMN) plays a central role in the physiopathology of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the effect of antidepressant treatment on functional connectivity within the DMN has yet to be established. Considering the very high rates of relapse in recovered subjects, we hypothesized that abnormalities in DMN functional connectivity would persist in recovered MDD subjects. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging images were collected from 24 MDD patients and 29 healthy control subjects. After 12 weeks of antidepressant treatment, 18 recovered MDD subjects were scanned again. Group independent component analysis was performed to decompose the resting state images into spatially independent components. Default mode subnetworks were identified using a template based on previous studies. Group differences in the ensuing subnetworks were tested using two-sample t tests. Two spatially independent default mode subnetworks were detected in all subjects: the anterior subnetwork and the posterior subnetwork. Both subnetworks showed increased functional connectivity in pretreatment MDD subjects, relative to control subjects. Differences in the posterior subnetwork were normalized after antidepressant treatment, while abnormal functional connectivity persisted within the anterior subnetwork. Our findings suggest a dissociation of the DMN into subnetworks, where persistent abnormal functional connectivity within the anterior subnetwork in recovered MDD subjects may constitute a biomarker of asymptomatic depression and potential for relapse.

fMRI","Two of the most commonly used illegal substances by adolescents are alcohol and cannabis. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and cannabis use disorder (CUD) are associated with poorer decision-making in adolescents. In adolescents, level of AUD symptomatology has been negatively associated with striatal reward responsivity. However, little work has explored the relationship with striatal reward prediction error (RPE) representation and the extent to which any augmentation of RPE by novel stimuli is impacted. One-hundred fifty-one adolescents participated in the Novelty Task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In this task, participants learn to choose novel or non-novel stimuli to gain monetary reward. Level of AUD symptomatology was negatively associated with both optimal decision-making and BOLD response modulation by RPE within striatum and regions of prefrontal cortex. The neural alterations in RPE representation were particularly pronounced when participants were exploring novel stimuli. Level of CUD symptomatology moderated the relationship between novelty propensity and RPE representation within inferior parietal lobule and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. These data expand on an emerging literature investigating individual associations of AUD symptomatology levels versus CUD symptomatology levels and RPE representation during reinforcement processing and provide insight on the role of neuro-computational processes underlying reinforcement learning/decision-making in adolescents.

fALFF","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease in elderly individuals. We conducted this study to examine whether alterations in the fractional amplitudes of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) in the AD spectrum were frequency-dependent and symptom-relevant. A total of 43 patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), 52 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), 44 with Alzheimer's dementia (d-AD) and 55 well-matched controls participated in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scans. The amplitudes were measured using fALFF within the slow-4 (0.027-0.073 Hz) and slow-5 (0.01-0.027 Hz) bands. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed on fALFF within two bands and correlated with neuropsychological test scores. The significant main effects of frequency and group on fALFF differed widely across brain regions. There were more varied areas in the slow-5 band than the slow-4 band. The fALFF associated with primary disease effects was mainly distributed in the parietal lobe. Obvious frequency band and group interaction effects were observed in the left angular gyrus, left calcarine fissure and surrounding cortex, left superior cerebellum, left cuneus and right lingual gyrus. Neuropsychological tests scores were significantly correlated with the fALFF magnitude of the left cuneus and right lingual in the slow-5 band. Our results suggested that the AD continuum had abnormal amplitudes in intrinsic brain activity, and these abnormalities were frequency-dependent and mainly associated with the slow-5 band rather than the slow-4 band. This may guide the frequency choice of future rs-fMRI studies and provide new insights into the neuropathophysiology of AD. ",

localizational","The contribution of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) to the retrieval of autobiographical memories is widely accepted. Results of former patient studies and functional imaging studies suggest different involvement of the MTL during the retrieval of autobiographical context information and the remoteness of these. Varying recency, the MTL contribution during chronological and locational autobiographical context information processing was investigated in this study. Thirteen males (mean = 25 years) judged the event's place or time in a two-choice recognition task. Subjects made significantly more errors on chronological judgments. Retrieval of chronological information activated the left MTL, while retrieval of locational information activated the MTL bilaterally. Retrieval of more recent than remote context information activated especially the right MTL. Our results underline different MTL contributions on the retrieval of autobiographical context information, depending on the content and on the remoteness of the event that took place. ",
pmid_16281289,Amygdala-prefrontal dissociation of subliminal and supraliminal fear.,,"Facial expressions of fear are universally recognized signals of potential threat. Humans may have evolved specialized neural systems for responding to fear in the absence of conscious stimulus detection. We used functional neuroimaging to establish whether the amygdala and the medial prefrontal regions to which it projects are engaged by subliminal fearful faces and whether responses to subliminal fear are distinguished from those to supraliminal fear. We also examined the time course of amygdala-medial prefrontal responses to supraliminal and subliminal fear. Stimuli were fearful and neutral baseline faces, presented under subliminal (16.7 ms and masked) or supraliminal (500 ms) conditions. Skin conductance responses (SCRs) were recorded simultaneously as an objective index of fear perception. SPM2 was used to undertake search region-of-interest (ROI) analyses for the amygdala and medial prefrontal (including anterior cingulate) cortex, and complementary whole-brain analyses. Time series data were extracted from ROIs to examine activity across early versus late phases of the experiment. SCRs and amygdala activity were enhanced in response to both subliminal and supraliminal fear perception. Time series analysis showed a trend toward greater right amygdala responses to subliminal fear, but left-sided responses to supraliminal fear. Cortically, subliminal fear was distinguished by right ventral anterior cingulate activity and supraliminal fear by dorsal anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal activity. Although subcortical amygdala activity was relatively persistent for subliminal fear, supraliminal fear showed more sustained cortical activity. The findings suggest that preverbal processing of fear may occur via a direct rostral-ventral amygdala pathway without the need for conscious surveillance, whereas elaboration of consciously attended signals of fear may rely on higher-order processing within a dorsal cortico-amygdala pathway.

pmid_22534578,The roots of modern justice: cognitive and neural foundations of social norms and their enforcement.,,"Among animals, Homo sapiens is unique in its capacity for widespread cooperation and prosocial behavior among large and genetically heterogeneous groups of individuals. This ultra-sociality figures largely in our success as a species. It is also an enduring evolutionary mystery. There is considerable support for the hypothesis that this facility is a function of our ability to establish, and enforce through sanctions, social norms. Third-party punishment of norm violations (""I punish you because you harmed him"") seems especially crucial for the evolutionary stability of cooperation and is the cornerstone of modern systems of criminal justice. In this commentary, we outline some potential cognitive and neural processes that may underlie the ability to learn norms, to follow norms and to enforce norms through third-party punishment. We propose that such processes depend on several domain-general cognitive functions that have been repurposed, through evolution's thrift, to perform these roles. ",

Hippocampus
Longitudinal fMRI
Novelty processing","Previous studies have shown that in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) multiple motor and extra-motor regions display structural and functional alterations. However, their temporal dynamics during disease-progression are unknown. To address this question we employed a longitudinal design assessing motor- and novelty-related brain activity in two fMRI sessions separated by a 3-month interval. In each session, patients and controls executed a Go/NoGo-task, in which additional presentation of novel stimuli served to elicit hippocampal activity. We observed a decline in the patients' movement-related activity during the 3-month interval. Importantly, in comparison to controls, the patients' motor activations were higher during the initial measurement. Thus, the relative decrease seems to reflect a breakdown of compensatory mechanisms due to progressive neural loss within the motor-system. In contrast, the patients' novelty-evoked hippocampal activity increased across 3 months, most likely reflecting the build-up of compensatory processes typically observed at the beginning of lesions. Consistent with a stage-dependent emergence of hippocampal and motor-system lesions, we observed a positive correlation between the ALSFRS-R or MRC-Megascores and the decline in motor activity, but a negative one with the hippocampal activation-increase. Finally, to determine whether the observed functional changes co-occur with structural alterations, we performed voxel-based volumetric analyses on magnetization transfer images in a separate patient cohort studied cross-sectionally at another scanning site. Therein, we observed a close overlap between the structural changes in this cohort, and the functional alterations in the other. Thus, our results provide important insights into the temporal dynamics of functional alterations during disease-progression, and provide support for an anatomical relationship between functional and structural cerebral changes in ALS.

pmid_16222226,Perceptions of moral character modulate the neural systems of reward during the trust game.,,"Studies of reward learning have implicated the striatum as part of a neural circuit that guides and adjusts future behavior on the basis of reward feedback. Here we investigate whether prior social and moral information about potential trading partners affects this neural circuitry. Participants made risky choices about whether to trust hypothetical trading partners after having read vivid descriptions of life events indicating praiseworthy, neutral or suspect moral character. Despite equivalent reinforcement rates for all partners, participants were persistently more likely to make risky choices with the 'good' partner. As expected from previous studies, activation of the caudate nucleus differentiated between positive and negative feedback, but only for the 'neutral' partner. Notably, it did not do so for the 'good' partner and did so only weakly for the 'bad' partner, suggesting that prior social and moral perceptions can diminish reliance on feedback mechanisms in the neural circuitry of trial-and-error reward learning.

pmid_20336686,Anterior cingulate activity and the self in disorders of consciousness.,,"The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between medial cortical activation and the presence of self and consciousness in healthy subjects and patients with vegetative state and minimally conscious state using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We first conducted two fMRI experiments in healthy subjects to identify brain regions specifically associated with self-perception through the use of different auditory stimuli that had different grades of self-relatedness. We then applied these regions as functional localizers to examine the relationship between neural activity changes during self-relatedness and consciousness level in the patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC). We demonstrated recruitment of various anterior medial cortical regions including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in healthy subjects during auditory perception of self-related stimuli. We further showed that patients with DOC showed signal changes in the ACC during auditory perception of self-related stimuli. Finally, it was shown that these signal changes correlate with the level of consciousness in the patients with DOC. The degree of consciousness in patients with DOC was correlated with neural activity in the ACC induced by self-related stimuli. Our results not only shed light on the pathophysiology of DOC, but may also suggest a useful neural, and thus diagnostic, marker of the dysfunction of consciousness in vegetative patients. ",

Using a slow event-related fMRI experiment, we investigated whether tactile and visual exploration of objects recruit the same ""visual"" areas (and in the case of visual cortex, the same retinotopic zones) and if these areas show reactivation during delayed actions in the dark toward haptically explored objects (and if so, whether this reactivation might be due to imagery). We examined activation during visual or haptic exploration of objects and action execution (grasping or reaching) separated by an 18 s delay. Twenty-nine human volunteers (13 females) participated in this study. Participants had their eyes open and fixated on a point in the dark. The objects were placed below the fixation point and accordingly visual exploration activated the cuneus, which processes retinotopic locations in the lower visual field. Strikingly, the occipital pole (OP), representing foveal locations, showed higher activation for tactile than visual exploration, although the stimulus was unseen and location in the visual field was peripheral. Moreover, the lateral occipital tactile-visual area (LOtv) showed comparable activation for tactile and visual exploration. Psychophysiological interaction analysis indicated that the OP showed stronger functional connectivity with anterior intraparietal sulcus and LOtv during the haptic than visual exploration of shapes in the dark. After the delay, the cuneus, OP, and LOtv showed reactivation that was independent of the sensory modality used to explore the object. These results show that haptic actions not only activate ""visual"" areas during object touch, but also that this information appears to be used in guiding grasping actions toward targets after a delay.

pmid_24763910,Opposing neural effects of naltrexone on food reward and aversion: implications for the treatment of obesity.,,"Opioid antagonism reduces the consumption of palatable foods in humans but the neural substrates implicated in these effects are less well understood. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of the opioid antagonist, naltrexone, on neural response to rewarding and aversive sight and taste stimuli. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural responses to the sight and taste of pleasant (chocolate) and aversive (mouldy strawberry) stimuli in 20 healthy volunteers who received a single oral dose of naltrexone (50 mg) and placebo in a double-blind, repeated-measures cross-over, design. Relative to placebo, naltrexone decreased reward activation to chocolate in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and caudate, and increased aversive-related activation to unpleasant strawberry in the amygdala and anterior insula. These findings suggest that modulation of key brain areas involved in reward processing, cognitive control and habit formation such as the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and caudate might underlie reduction in food intake with opioid antagonism. Furthermore we show for the first time that naltrexone can increase activations related to aversive food stimuli. These results support further investigation of opioid treatments in obesity. ",

The resulting values were rank ordered. After our fMRI-based forecast an instore test was conducted in a supermarket on n=63.617 shoppers. Changes in sales were best forecasted by fMRI signal during communication viewing, second best by a comparison of brain signal during product viewing before and after communication and least by explicit liking judgements. The results demonstrate the feasibility of applying neuroimaging methods in a relatively small sample to correctly forecast sales changes at point-of-sale. ",
pmid_17451973,Central control of grasp: manipulation of objects with complex and simple dynamics.,,"We performed whole-brain fMRI to explore the neural mechanisms that contribute to the ability to manipulate an object with complex dynamics. Subjects grasped a weighted flexible ruler and balanced it in an unstable equilibrium position as an archetype of grasping an object with complex dynamics. This was contrasted with squeezing a soft foam ball as an archetype of grasping an object with simple dynamics. We hypothesized that changes in activity in primary motor cortex (MI) would be similar under the two conditions, since muscle activation was matched, which was confirmed. We hypothesized further that the cerebellum would be selectively activated when manipulating the flexible ruler because the ability to make the adjustments necessary to balance the ruler would require an internal dynamics model, represented in the cerebellum. As predicted, the ipsilateral cerebellum was strongly activated when balancing the weighted ruler whereas only moderate activation was found when squeezing the foam ball. We also found evidence for selective activation of areas, previously implicated in tactile object recognition, when holding the flexible ruler. We speculate that these areas, which include secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), Brodmann area 40 and insula, integrate tactile and proprioceptive information in the context of controlling the orientation of the flexible ruler and provide appropriate feedback to MI. We speculate that the failure to find activation of these areas when squeezing the ball was due to the fact that tactile stimulation was entirely self-produced, resulting in the attenuation of cortical sensory activity (Blakemore, S.-J., Wolpert, D.M., Frith, C.D., 1998. Central cancellation of self-produced tickle sensation. Nat. Neurosci. 1, 635-640, Blakemore, S.-J., Frith, C.D., Wolpert, D.M., 2001.

Anhedonia also represents a vulnerability marker for schizophrenia when measured in non-clinical individuals. The investigation of the neural correlates of anhedonia in schizophrenia and non-clinical individuals could provide key insights on the pathophysiology of negative symptoms, as well as on the characterization of neural markers of vulnerability. Thirty patients with schizophrenia and twenty-six non-clinical individuals were recruited. We used an event-related functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging paradigm involving an emotional picture viewing task. For each group, separately, we correlated the regional BOLD signal changes during hedonic processing with the Chapman Physical Anhedonia Scale scores. An interaction analysis identified the neural correlates of anhedonia specific to schizophrenia. We found that anhedonia severity in both groups was inversely correlated with the activity of a limited number of emotion-related regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex. The orbitofrontal cortex and putamen/ventral striatum activity was negatively correlated with anhedonia severity in people with schizophrenia only. The data first suggest that anhedonia severity is linked to a poor modulation of emotional/attentional brain regions during the processing of hedonic information. The link between anhedonia and the activity of the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex found in schizophrenia could reflect the specific impairment of indirect factors, such as reward anticipation deficits, that influence the measurement of anhedonia severity through self-report questionnaires.

We tested the hypothesis that people diagnosed with ADHD during adolescence present residual brain abnormalities both in brain structure and in working memory brain function. 83 young adults (aged 20-24 years) from the Northern Finland 1986 Birth Cohort were classified as diagnosed with ADHD in adolescence (adolescence ADHD, n = 49) or a control group (n = 34). Only one patient had received medication for ADHD. T1-weighted brain scans were acquired and processed in a voxel-based analysis using permutation-based statistics. A sub-sample of both groups (ADHD, n = 21; controls n = 23) also performed a Sternberg working memory task whilst acquiring fMRI data. Areas of structural difference were used as a region of interest to evaluate the implications that structural abnormalities found in the ADHD group might have on working memory function. There was lower grey matter volume bilaterally in adolescence ADHD participants in the caudate (p < 0.05 FWE corrected across the whole brain) at age 20-24. Working memory was poorer in adolescence ADHD participants, with associated failure to show normal load-dependent caudate activation. Young adults diagnosed with ADHD in adolescence have structural and functional deficits in the caudate associated with abnormal working memory function. These findings are not secondary to stimulant treatment, and emphasise the importance of taking a wider perspective on ADHD outcomes than simply whether or not a particular patient meets diagnostic criteria at any given point in time.

pmid_23124358,Perception of pointing from biological motion point-light displays in typically developing children and children with autism spectrum disorder.,,"We examined whether the movement involved in a pointing gesture, depicted using point-light displays, is sufficient to cue attention in typically developing children (TD) and children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (aged 8-11 years). Using a Posner-type paradigm, a centrally located display indicated the location of a forthcoming target on 80% of trials and the opposite location on 20% of trials. TD children, but not children with ASD, were faster to identify a validly cued target than an invalidly cued target. A scrambled version of the point-light pointing gesture, retaining individual dot speed and direction of movement but not the configuration, produced no validity effect in either group. A video of a pointing gesture produced validity effects in both groups. ",

working memory","Previous studies investigating working memory performance in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have mainly focused on the neural mechanisms of alterations in activation. To date, very few studies have investigated background network alterations in the working memory state. Therefore, the present study investigated the static and temporal dynamic changes in the background network in MCI patients during a working memory task. A hybrid delayed-match-to-sample task was used to examine working memory performance in MCI patients. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected and the marker of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) was used to investigate alterations in the background network. The present study demonstrated static and dynamic alterations of ALFF in MCI patients during working memory tasks, relative to the resting state. Traditional static analysis revealed that ALFF decreased in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), right dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), and left supplementary motor area for normal controls (NCs) in the working memory state. However, the same regions showed increased ALFF in MCI patients. Furthermore, relative to NCs, MCI patients demonstrated altered performance-related functional connectivity (FC) patterns, with the right VLPFC and right DLPFC as ROIs. In terms of temporal dynamic analysis, the present study found that in the working memory state dynamic ALFF of bilateral thalamus regions was increased in NCs but decreased in MCI patients. Additionally, MCI patients demonstrated altered performance-related coefficient of variation patterns; the regions in MCI patients were larger and more widely distributed in the parietal and temporal lobes, relative to NCs. This is the first study to examine static and temporal dynamic alterations of ALFF in the background network of MCI patients in working memory states. The results extend previous studies by providing a new perspective on the neural mechanisms of working memory deficits in MCI patients. ",

Orbitofrontal cortex
fMRI","The present study aimed to detect differences in the reward response between adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and healthy controls (HCs) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The Iowa gambling task (IGT) was designed to explore participants' reward-related decision-making in relation to selections during risky behaviors. Twenty adults with ADHD and 20 HCs were enrolled. fMRI with a modified IGT was performed. The adults with ADHD showed a poorer performance in terms of avoidance during risky behaviors. The fMRI results indicated that the adults with ADHD had significantly lower orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) activation. A positive correlation between performance in the IGT and brain activation in the OFC was detected. The results suggested that the adults with ADHD exhibited abnormal OFC responses during decision-making. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use fMRI to collect brain activation data while performing the IGT in adults with ADHD. Our findings suggest that deficits in reward processing in ADHD are still present during adulthood. ",
pmid_23051902,Social cognition and the anterior temporal lobes: a review and theoretical framework.,,"Memory for people and their relationships, along with memory for social language and social behaviors, constitutes a specific type of semantic memory termed social knowledge. This review focuses on how and where social knowledge is represented in the brain. We propose that portions of the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) play a critical role in representing and retrieving social knowledge. This includes memory about people, their names and biographies and more abstract forms of social memory such as memory for traits and social concepts. This hypothesis is based on the convergence of several lines of research including anatomical findings, lesion evidence from both humans and non-human primates and neuroimaging evidence. Moreover, the ATL is closely interconnected with cortical nuclei of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex via the uncinate fasciculus. We propose that this pattern of connectivity underlies the function of the ATL in encoding and storing emotionally tagged knowledge that is used to guide orbitofrontal-based decision processes. ",

A total of 54 subjects, including 30 migraineurs and 24 gender- and age-matched HCs completed the fMRI. All the data and ALFF, fALFF analyses were preprocessed with the Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF). All of the statistical analyses were performed using the REST software to explore the differences in ALFF and fALFF between migraine patients and HCs. In contrast to HCs, migraine patients showed significant ALFF increase in the left medulla and pons, the bilateral cerebellum posterior lobe and right insula. The regions showing decreased ALFF in migraine patients included the bilateral cerebellum posterior lobe, left cerebellum anterior lobe, bilateral orbital cortex, right middle frontal gyrus, bilateral occipital lobe, right fusiform gyrus, and bilateral postcentral gyrus. The fALFFs in migraine patients were significantly increased in the bilateral insular and left orbital cortex, but were decreased in the left occipital lobe and bilateral cerebellum posterior lobe. These ALFF and fALFF alterations in the brain regions of migraineurs are in keeping with the domains associated with pain and cognition. Such brain functional alteration may contribute to further understanding of migraine-related network imbalances demonstrated in previous studies. ",

tomography","Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the most effective treatment for a depressive episode but the mechanism of action and neural correlates of response are poorly understood. Different theories have suggested that anticonvulsant properties or neurotrophic effects are related to the unique mechanism of action of ECT. This review assessed longitudinal imaging investigations (both structural and functional) associated with ECT response published from 2002 to August 2013. We identified 26 investigations that used a variety of different imaging modalities and data analysis methods. Despite these methodological differences, we summarized the major findings of each investigation and identified common patterns that exist across multiple investigations. The ECT response is associated with decreased frontal perfusion, metabolism, and functional connectivity and increased volume and neuronal chemical metabolites. The general collective of longitudinal neuroimaging investigations support both the anticonvulsant and the neurotrophic effects of ECT. We propose a conceptual framework that integrates these seemingly contradictory hypotheses. ",
pmid_11835603,Neural representation of verb meaning: an fMRI study.,,"The neural basis for verb comprehension has proven elusive, in part because of the limited range of verb categories that have been assessed. In the present study, 16 healthy young adults were probed for the meaning associated with verbs of MOTION and verbs of COGNITION. We observed distinct patterns of activation for each verb subcategory: MOTION verbs are associated with recruitment of left ventral temporal-occipital cortex, bilateral prefrontal cortex and caudate, whereas COGNITION verbs are associated with left posterolateral temporal activation. These findings are consistent with the claim that the neural representations of verb subcategories are distinct. Although the ""sensory-motor"" hypothesis may play a role in explaining activation associated with MOTION verbs, the left posterolateral temporal distribution of cortical activation associated with COGNITION verbs cannot be easily explained by the ""sensory-motor"" hypothesis. We suggest that left posterolateral temporal activation supports aspects of lexical semantic processing concerned with the neural representation of propositional knowledge contributing to COGNITION verbs. ",
pmid_23069840,Neural correlates of stress- and food cue-induced food craving in obesity: association with insulin levels.,,"Obesity is associated with alterations in corticolimbic-striatal brain regions involved in food motivation and reward. Stress and the presence of food cues may each motivate eating and engage corticolimibic-striatal neurocircuitry. It is unknown how these factors interact to influence brain responses and whether these interactions are influenced by obesity, insulin levels, and insulin sensitivity. We hypothesized that obese individuals would show greater responses in corticolimbic-striatal neurocircuitry after exposure to stress and food cues and that brain activations would correlate with subjective food craving, insulin levels, and HOMA-IR. Fasting insulin levels were assessed in obese and lean subjects who were exposed to individualized stress and favorite-food cues during functional MRI. Obese, but not lean, individuals exhibited increased activation in striatal, insular, and hypothalamic regions during exposure to favorite-food and stress cues. In obese but not lean individuals, food craving, insulin, and HOMA-IR levels correlated positively with neural activity in corticolimbic-striatal brain regions during favorite-food and stress cues. The relationship between insulin resistance and food craving in obese individuals was mediated by activity in motivation-reward regions including the striatum, insula, and thalamus. These findings demonstrate that obese, but not lean, individuals exhibit increased corticolimbic-striatal activation in response to favorite-food and stress cues and that these brain responses mediate the relationship between HOMA-IR and food craving. Improving insulin sensitivity and in turn reducing corticolimbic-striatal reactivity to food cues and stress may diminish food craving and affect eating behavior in obesity. ",
pmid_19922114,Structural and functional changes mapped in the brains of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients with/without dysphagia: a pilot study.,,"The purpose of this study was to explore cerebral structural and functional changes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients with or without dysphagia compared with healthy adults. In total, five ALS patients with dysphagia, five ALS patients without dysphagia and 10 healthy controls were evaluated using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) and event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while laryngeal swallow-related movements were recorded. The fMRI data were analysed using the general linear model to gain the differential statistical map (two-sample t-test) for each group. Maps of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were calculated within the masks that corresponded to the different statistical functional maps of intergroup comparisons. During the voluntary saliva swallowing, prominent activation of foci corresponded to the primary sensorimotor (SM) cortex in both ALS and controls, while decreased activation of the SM cortex was observed in ALS patients with dysphagia. DTI analysis revealed that FA was significantly reduced and MD was typically increased in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, thalamus, and anterior cingulate gyrus, as well as in the insula of ALS patients compared with controls. However, in ALS patients with dysphagia, FA and MD were more sensitive to these changes than ALS patients without dysphagia. This study highlights the potential of DTI and fMRI for monitoring structural degeneration and functional changes in patients with ALS. This study is the first to demonstrate that cerebral activation map changes correspond to distribution patterns of diffusion abnormalities. Combined non-invasive neuroimaging techniques may be useful tools to assess prognosis and study rehabilitation strategies for dysphagic ALS patients, especially for patients who are MRI-negative by conventional methods.

simulation theory","Autistic traits span a wide spectrum of behavioral departures from typical function. Despite the heterogeneous nature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), there have been attempts at formulating unified theoretical accounts of the associated impairments in social cognition. A class of prominent theories capitalizes on the link between social interaction and visual perception: effective interaction with others often relies on discrimination of subtle nonverbal cues. It has been proposed that individuals with ASD may rely on poorer perceptual representations of other people's actions as returned by dysfunctional visual circuitry and that this, in turn, may lead to less effective interpretation of those actions for social behavior. It remains unclear whether such perceptual deficits exist in ASD: the evidence currently available is limited to specific aspects of action recognition, and the reported deficits are often attributable to cognitive factors that may not be strictly visual (e.g., attention). We present results from an exhaustive set of measurements spanning the entire action processing hierarchy, from motion detection to action interpretation, designed to factor out effects that are not selectively relevant to this function. Our results demonstrate that the ASD perceptual system returns functionally intact signals for interpreting other people's actions adequately; these signals can be accessed effectively when autistic individuals are prompted and motivated to do so under controlled conditions. However, they may fail to exploit them adequately during real-life social interactions. ",
pmid_19414707,"The relationship between aberrant neuronal activation in the pregenual anterior cingulate, altered glutamatergic metabolism, and anhedonia in major depression.",,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by diverse metabolic and functional abnormalities that occur in, among other regions, the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC), a cortical region linked to anhedonia. To contextualize metabolic, functional, and clinical parameters and thus to reveal cellular mechanisms related to anhedonia. The pgACC was investigated using a combined functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopic approach. Negative blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activations in the pgACC were assessed during emotional stimulation. Quantitative J-resolved magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the pgACC enabled simultaneous determination of glutamine, glutamate, N-acetylaspartate, glucose, and gamma-aminobutyric acid concentrations. Subjective emotional intensity ratings as well as various clinical parameters were determined. The patients were recruited and evaluated in the Department of Psychiatry, University of Zurich, while the measurements were performed in the Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Zurich and the Technical University Zurich. Nineteen unmedicated patients with MDD and 24 healthy subjects. Reduced glutamine levels and lower functional responses in pgACC in anhedonic depressed patients were expected to be the predominant effect of abnormal glutamatergic transmission. It was further tested if, among patients, the ratings of emotional intensity on visual stimulation predicted the amount of metabolic and functional alterations in terms of reduced relative metabolite concentrations and BOLD changes. Patients with highly anhedonic MDD show decreased glutamine but normal glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid concentrations, with glutamine concentrations being dissociated from glucose concentrations. Glutamate and N-acetylaspartate concentrations in pgACC correlate with negative BOLD responses induced by emotional stimulation in MDD; whereas in healthy subjects, negative BOLD responses correlate with gamma-aminobutyric acid instead. Negative BOLD responses as well as glutamate and N-acetylaspartate concentrations correlate with emotional intensity ratings, an anhedonia surrogate, in those with MDD but not in healthy subjects. Aberrant neuronal activation patterns of the pgACC in anhedonic depression are related to deficits of glutamatergic metabolism. ",

The aim of this study was to investigate alterations in gray matter (GM) volume and functional connectivity during resting state in individuals with IGD using voxel-based morphometry and a resting-state connectivity analysis. The participants included 20 individuals with IGD and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Resting-state functional and structural images were acquired for all participants using 3 T magnetic resonance imaging. We also measured the severity of IGD and impulsivity using psychological scales. The results show that IGD severity was positively correlated with GM volume in the left caudate ( ",
pmid_12948696,Cortical and limbic activation during viewing of high- versus low-calorie foods.,,"Despite the high prevalence of obesity, eating disorders, and weight-related health problems in modernized cultures, the neural systems regulating human feeding remain poorly understood. Therefore, we applied functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the cerebral responses of 13 healthy normal-weight adult women as they viewed color photographs of food. The motivational salience of the stimuli was manipulated by presenting images from three categories: high-calorie foods, low-calorie foods, and nonedible dining-related utensils. Both food categories were associated with bilateral activation of the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. High-calorie foods yielded significant activation within the medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, corpus callosum, and cerebellum. Low-calorie foods yielded smaller regions of focal activation within medial orbitofrontal cortex; primary gustatory/somatosensory cortex; and superior, middle, and medial temporal regions. Findings suggest that the amygdala may be responsive to a general category of biologically relevant stimuli such as food, whereas separate ventromedial prefrontal systems may be activated depending on the perceived reward value or motivational salience of food stimuli.

pmid_19411368,Reduced caudate and nucleus accumbens response to rewards in unmedicated individuals with major depressive disorder.,,"Major depressive disorder is characterized by impaired reward processing, possibly due to dysfunction in the basal ganglia. However, few neuroimaging studies of depression have distinguished between anticipatory and consummatory phases of reward processing. Using functional MRI (fMRI) and a task that dissociates anticipatory and consummatory phases of reward processing, the authors tested the hypothesis that individuals with major depression would show reduced reward-related responses in basal ganglia structures. A monetary incentive delay task was presented to 30 unmedicated individuals with major depressive disorder and 31 healthy comparison subjects during fMRI scanning. Whole-brain analyses focused on neural responses to reward-predicting cues and rewarding outcomes (i.e., monetary gains). Secondary analyses focused on the relationship between anhedonic symptoms and basal ganglia volumes. Relative to comparison subjects, participants with major depression showed significantly weaker responses to gains in the left nucleus accumbens and the caudate bilaterally. Group differences in these regions were specific to rewarding outcomes and did not generalize to neutral or negative outcomes, although relatively reduced responses to monetary penalties in the major depression group emerged in other caudate regions. By contrast, evidence for group differences during reward anticipation was weaker, although participants with major depression showed reduced activation to reward cues in a small sector of the left posterior putamen. In the major depression group, anhedonic symptoms and depression severity were associated with reduced caudate volume bilaterally. These results suggest that basal ganglia dysfunction in major depression may affect the consummatory phase of reward processing. Additionally, morphometric results suggest that anhedonia in major depression is related to caudate volume. ",

tripartite neurocognitive model","Internet gaming disorder (IGD) is a concerning issue that requires further research. Here, we seek to examine its neural etiology with an emphasis on the role of the insula. To do so, we relied on the tripartite neurocognitive model of addictive behaviors as applied to IGD. We hypothesized that (a) video game cues will elicit stronger reward system activation and weaker prefrontal activation in gamers vs controls, (b) the IGD scores of gamers will be positively associated with activation of the reward system and negatively with activation of prefrontal regions, (c) deprivation from video gaming will result in increased activation of the insula, when gamers are exposed to video game cues vs to neutral cues, and (d) in deprivation conditions, there will be positive and negative coupling, respectively, between activation of the insula and the reward and prefrontal regions in gamers. We tested these hypotheses with a design with one between-subjects factor (gamers vs controls) and two within-subjects factors: stimuli (gaming vs neutral; for all participants) and session (deprivation vs satiety; only for gamers). Findings based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; applied to all 52 subjects, 26 gamers, and 26 controls) and psychophysiological interaction (PPI; applied to the 26 gamers) engaged in a video reactivity task supported our assertions. The IGD score positively correlated with activity in the right ventral striatum and negatively with activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Left insular cortex activity was the highest when observing video gaming cues under deprivation. Lastly, there was an increased coupling between the left insula and left ventral striatum and a decreased coupling with left DLPFC when observing video gaming cues compared with when watching control videos in the deprivation condition.

Previous neuroimaging studies have identified the brain-reward and decision-making systems that are involved in the response to the energy density (ED) (kilocalories per gram) of foods, but few studies have examined the brain response to the food portion size (PS). We used functional MRI (fMRI) to determine the brain response to food images that differed in PSs (large and small) and ED (high and low). Block-design fMRI was used to assess the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response to images in 36 children (7-10 y old; girls: 50%), which was tested after a 2-h fast. Pre-fMRI fullness and liking were rated on visual analog scales. A whole-brain cluster-corrected analysis was used to compare BOLD activation for main effects of the PS, ED, and their interaction. Secondary analyses were used to associate BOLD contrast values with appetitive traits and laboratory intake from meals for which the portions of all foods were increased. Compared with small-PS cues, large-PS cues were associated with decreased activation in the inferior frontal gyrus (P < 0.01). Compared with low-ED cues, high-ED cues were associated with increased activation in multiple regions (e.g., in the caudate, cingulate, and precentral gyrus) and decreased activation in the insula and superior temporal gyrus (P < 0.01 for all). A PS × ED interaction was shown in the superior temporal gyrus (P < 0.01). BOLD contrast values for high-ED cues compared with low-ED cues in the insula, declive, and precentral gyrus were negatively related to appetitive traits (P < 0.05). There were no associations between the brain response to the PS and either appetitive traits or intake. Cues regarding food PS may be processed in the lateral prefrontal cortex, which is a region that is implicated in cognitive control, whereas ED activates multiple areas involved in sensory and reward processing. Possible implications include the development of interventions that target decision-making and reward systems differently to moderate overeating. ",

Recent neuroimaging studies have begun to identify IA-related changes in specific brain regions and connections. However, whether and how the interactions within and between the large-scale brain networks are disrupted in individuals with IA remain largely unexplored. Using group independent component analysis, we extracted five intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) from the resting-state fMRI data of 26 adolescents with IA and 43 controls, including the anterior and posterior default mode network (DMN), left and right fronto-parietal network (FPN), and salience network (SN). We then examined the possible group differences in the functional connectivity within each ICN and between the ICNs. We found that, compared with controls, IA subjects showed: (1) reduced inter-hemispheric functional connectivity of the right FPN, whereas increased intra-hemispheric functional connectivity of the left FPN; (2) reduced functional connectivity in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of the anterior DMN; (3) reduced functional connectivity between the SN and anterior DMN. Our findings suggest that IA is associated with imbalanced interactions among the DMN, FPN and SN, which may serve as system-level neural underpinnings for the uncontrollable Internet-using behaviors.

To delineate the different functional circuits of effective antidepressant treatment and residual functional impairments is able to better guide clinical therapy for depression. Herein, voxel-level whole brain functional connectivity homogeneity (FcHo), functional connectivity, multivariate pattern classification approaches were applied to reveal the specific circuits for treatment response and residual impairments in MDD patients after ECT. Increased FcHo values in right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and left angular gyrus (AG) and their corresponding functional connectivities between dmPFC and right AG, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), superior frontal gyrus, precuneus (Pcu) and between left AG with dlPFC, bilateral AG, and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in MDD patients after ECT. Moreover, we found decreased FcHo values in left middle occipital gyrus (MOG) and lingual gyrus (LG) and decreased functional connectivities between MOG and dorsal postcentral gyrus (PCG) and between LG and middle PCG/anterior superior parietal lobule in MDD patients before and after ECT compared to healthy controls (HCs). The increased or normalized FcHo and functional connections may be related to effective antidepressant therapy, and the decreased FcHo and functional connectivities may account for the residual functional impairments in MDD patients after ECT. The different change patterns in MDD after ECT indicated a specific brain circuit supporting fast remission of depression, which was supported by the following multivariate pattern classification analyses. Finally, we found that the changed FcHo in dmPFC was correlated with changed depression scores. These results revealed a specific functional circuit supporting antidepressant effects of ECT and neuroanatomical basis for residual functional impairments. Our findings also highlighted the key role of dmPFC in antidepressant and will provide an important reference for depression treatment. ",

MRI data were collected in 11 alcoholic patients with KS, 34 alcoholic patients without KS, and 25 healthy control subjects (CS). Gray and white matter volumes were compared in the 3 groups using a voxel-based approach. A conjunction analysis indicated a large pattern of shared gray and white matter volume deficits in AL and KS. There were graded effects of volume deficits (KS < AL < CS) in the medial portion of the thalami, hypothalamus (mammillary bodies), left insula, and genu of the corpus callosum. Abnormalities in the left thalamic radiation were observed only in KS. Our results indicate considerable similarities in the pattern of gray and white matter damage in AL and KS. This finding confirms the widespread neurotoxic effect of chronic alcohol consumption. Only a few cerebral regions, including the medial thalami, mammillary bodies, and corpus callosum, were more severely damaged in KS than in AL. The continuum of macrostructural damage from AL to KS is therefore restricted to key brain structures. Longitudinal investigations are required to determine whether alcoholic patients with medial thalamic volumes that are comparable to those of patients with KS are at increased risk of developing KS.

Social drinking","The ability to suppress responses that are inappropriate, as well as the mechanisms monitoring the accuracy of actions in order to compensate for errors, is central to human behavior. Neural alterations that prevent stopping an inaccurate response, combined with a decreased ability of error monitoring, are considered to be prominent features of alcohol abuse. Moreover, (i) alterations of these processes have been reported in heavy social drinkers (i.e. young healthy individuals who do not yet exhibit a state of alcohol dependence); and (ii) through longitudinal studies, these alterations have been shown to underlie subsequent disinhibition that may lead to future alcohol use disorders. In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study, using a contextual Go/No-Go task, we investigated whether different neural networks subtended correct inhibitions and monitoring mechanisms of failed inhibitory trials in light versus heavy social drinkers. We show that, although successful inhibition did not lead to significant changes, neural networks involved in error monitoring are different in light versus heavy drinkers. Thus, while light drinkers exhibited activations in their right inferior frontal, right middle cingulate and left superior temporal areas; heavy drinkers exhibited activations in their right cerebellum, left caudate nucleus, left superior occipital region, and left amygdala. These data are functionally interpreted as reflecting a ""visually-driven emotional strategy"" vs. an ""executive-based"" neural response to errors in heavy and light drinkers, respectively. Such a difference is interpreted as a key-factor that may subtend the transition from a controlled social heavy consumption to a state of clinical alcohol dependence. ",
pmid_19958569,Amygdala activation to masked happy facial expressions.,,"The amygdala has a key role in automatic non-conscious processing of emotions. Highly salient emotional stimuli elicit amygdala activity, and happy faces are among the most rapidly perceived facial expressions. In backward masking paradigms, an image is presented briefly and then masked by another stimulus. However, reports of amygdala responses to masked happy faces have been mixed. In the present study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine amygdala activation to masked happy, sad, and neutral facial expressions. Masked happy faces elicited greater amygdala activation bilaterally as compared to masked sad faces.

pmid_17182226,Amygdala reactivity predicts automatic negative evaluations for facial emotions.,,"The amygdala is a key structure in a limbic circuit involved in the rapid and unconscious processing of facial emotions. In the present study, the role of the amygdala in automatic, involuntary appraisal processes, which are believed to be a crucial component of emotion processing, was investigated in 23 healthy subjects. Amygdala activity was recorded in response to masked displays of angry, sad, and happy facial expressions using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In a subsequent experiment, the subjects performed a masked affective priming task that characterizes automatic emotion processing by investigating the biasing effect of subliminally presented emotional faces on evaluative ratings to subsequently presented neutral stimuli. In the affective priming task, significant valence-congruent evaluation manipulation was observed. Subjects rated neutral targets more positively if they were primed by happy faces. Significant correlations were found between amygdala responses to masked negative facial expressions and negative evaluation shifts elicited by the corresponding emotion quality in the affective priming task. Spontaneous amygdala reactivity to facial emotions appears to be a determinant of automatic negative evaluative response tendencies. This finding might shed some light on how amygdala hyperresponsivity contributes to negative cognitive biases commonly observed in affective disorders. ",

These adverse psychiatric outcomes may reflect the negative impact of alcohol and/or cannabis abuse on neural systems mediating reward and/or error detection. However, work indicative of this has mostly been conducted in adults with Alcohol and/or Cannabis Use Disorder (i.e., AUD and CUD), with relatively little work in adolescent patients. Furthermore, of the work that has been conducted in adolescents, groups were based on categorical diagnoses of AUD and/or CUD, so the relationship between AUD and/or CUD symptom severity in adolescents and neural dysfunction is unclear. We used a Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task to examine the relationship between AUDIT and/or CUDIT scores and functional integrity of neuro-circuitries mediating reward processing and error detection within 150 adolescents. Our findings indicate that AUDIT score is negatively related to activity in reward processing neuro-circuitry in adolescents. However, CUDIT score is negatively related to activity in brain regions involved in error detection. Each of these relationships reflected a medium effect size (Partial-η ",
pmid_17765211,Cortical activation during motor imagery is reduced in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,,"The neural correlates of motor execution in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) are challenging to investigate due to muscle weakness. Alternatives to traditional motor execution paradigms are therefore of great interest. This study tested the hypothesis that patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) would show increased cortical activation during motor imagery compared to healthy controls, as seen in studies of motor execution. Functional MRI was used to measure activation during a block design paradigm contrasting imagery of right hand movements against rest in 16 patients with ALS and 17 age-matched healthy controls. Patients with ALS showed reduced activation during motor imagery in the left inferior parietal lobule, and in the anterior cingulate gyrus and medial pre-frontal cortex. This reduction in cortical activation during motor imagery contrasts with the pattern seen during motor execution. This may represent the disruption of normal motor imagery networks by ALS pathology outside the primary motor cortex. ",

To examine TCC-associated changes in functional connectomes, resting-state functional magnetic resonance images were acquired from 40 older individuals including 22 experienced TCC practitioners (experts) and 18 demographically matched TCC-naïve healthy controls, and their local functional homogeneities across the cortical mantle were compared. Compared to the controls, the TCC experts had significantly greater and more experience-dependent functional homogeneity in the right post-central gyrus (PosCG) and less functional homogeneity in the left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the right dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex. Increased functional homogeneity in the PosCG was correlated with TCC experience. Intriguingly, decreases in functional homogeneity (improved functional specialization) in the left ACC and increases in functional homogeneity (improved functional integration) in the right PosCG both predicted performance gains on attention network behavior tests. These findings provide evidence for the functional plasticity of the brain's intrinsic architecture toward optimizing locally functional organization, with great implications for understanding the effects of TCC on cognition, behavior and health in aging population.

pmid_22711879,Differential neural circuitry and self-interest in real vs hypothetical moral decisions.,,"Classic social psychology studies demonstrate that people can behave in ways that contradict their intentions--especially within the moral domain. We measured brain activity while subjects decided between financial self-benefit (earning money) and preventing physical harm (applying an electric shock) to a confederate under both real and hypothetical conditions. We found a shared neural network associated with empathic concern for both types of decisions. However, hypothetical and real moral decisions also recruited distinct neural circuitry: hypothetical moral decisions mapped closely onto the imagination network, while real moral decisions elicited activity in the bilateral amygdala and anterior cingulate--areas essential for social and affective processes. Moreover, during real moral decision-making, distinct regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) determined whether subjects make selfish or pro-social moral choices. Together, these results reveal not only differential neural mechanisms for real and hypothetical moral decisions but also that the nature of real moral decisions can be predicted by dissociable networks within the PFC.

We performed whole brain resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) analysis by studying the key hubs of frontal-limbic circuit: anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), bilateral insula subregions, bilateral amygdala (Amy) as seeds, separately, to discriminate bipolar depression (BipD) from unipolar depression (UniD). We compared seed-based rs-FC of the frontal-limbic seeds with whole brain among 23 BipD participants; 23 age, gender, and depression severity matched patients with UniD, and 23 healthy controls (HCs). We also used support vector machine learning to study classification based on the rs-FC of ACC, bilateral insula subregions, and bilateral Amy seeds with whole brain. BipD showed increased rs-FC between the left ventral anterior insula (vAI) seed and the left anterior supramarginal gyrus (aSMG) and left postcentral gyrus, as well as increased rs-FC between left amygdala seed and the left aSMG when compared to HCs and UniD. Compared to UniD, BipD was associated with increased rs-FC between right dorsal anterior insula seed and right superior frontal gyrus, as well as increased rs-FC between left posterior insula seed and right precentral gyrus and right thalamus. Combined rs-FC of ACC, bilateral insula subregions and bilateral Amy seeds with the whole brain discriminated BipD from UniD with an accuracy of 91.30%. Rs-FC of the emotional regulation circuit is more widely disturbed in BipD than UniD. Using rs-FC with this circuit may lead to further developments in diagnostic decision-making. ",
pmid_20421978,Simultaneous EEG-fMRI during a working memory task: modulations in low and high frequency bands.,,"EEG studies of working memory (WM) have demonstrated load dependent frequency band modulations. FMRI studies have localized load modulated activity to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Recently, an EEG-fMRI study found that low frequency band (theta and alpha) activity negatively correlated with the BOLD signal during the retention phase of a WM task. However, the coupling of higher (beta and gamma) frequencies with the BOLD signal during WM is unknown. In 16 healthy adult subjects, we first investigated EEG-BOLD signal correlations for theta (5-7 Hz), alpha1 (8-10), alpha2 (10-12 Hz), beta1 (13-20), beta2 (20-30 Hz), and gamma (30-40 Hz) during the retention period of a WM task with set size 2 and 5. Secondly, we investigated whether load sensitive brain regions are characterised by effects that relate frequency bands to BOLD signals effects. We found negative theta-BOLD signal correlations in the MPFC, PPC, and cingulate cortex (ACC and PCC). For alpha1 positive correlations with the BOLD signal were found in ACC, MPFC, and PCC; negative correlations were observed in DLPFC, PPC, and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Negative alpha2-BOLD signal correlations were observed in parieto-occipital regions. Beta1-BOLD signal correlations were positive in ACC and negative in precentral and superior temporal gyrus. Beta2 and gamma showed only positive correlations with BOLD, e.g., in DLPFC, MPFC (gamma) and IFG (beta2/gamma). The load analysis revealed that theta and--with one exception--beta and gamma demonstrated exclusively positive load effects, while alpha1 showed only negative effects. We conclude that the directions of EEG-BOLD signal correlations vary across brain regions and EEG frequency bands. In addition, some brain regions show both load sensitive BOLD and frequency band effects. Our data indicate that lower as well as higher frequency brain oscillations are linked to neurovascular processes during WM. ",
pmid_31025560,"Adult patients with ADHD differ from healthy controls in implicit, but not explicit, emotion regulation.",,"There is increasing evidence that people with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are impaired in emotion regulation, but psychophysiological and functional MRI data on emotion processing in adult patients with ADHD are scarce. We investigated the neural correlates of reappraisal as one of the most efficient emotion-regulation strategies. We included 30 adult patients with ADHD and 35 healthy controls in our study. We applied a well-established reappraisal paradigm in functional MRI and assessed behavioural emotion-regulation strategies with standardized questionnaires. We hypothesized that patients with ADHD would demonstrate impaired reappraisal related to reduced activations in the frontoparietal cognitive control network. Despite our hypothesis, we found no significant activation differences in the neural reappraisal network between patients with ADHD and controls. As well, both groups revealed similar reappraisal success on the immediate behavioural ratings in the scanner. Interestingly, patients with ADHD revealed significantly increased activations in the dorsal and ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) compared to controls when viewing negative > neutral pictures. These ACC activations were significantly correlated with the prevalence of habitual use of reappraisal in patients with ADHD only. Patients withdrew medication only 24 hours before the experiment; we investigated negative, but not positive, emotion processing and regulation. Although emotion dysregulation is regarded as a core symptom of ADHD, explicit reappraisal does not seem to be impaired in adult patients. However, increased activation of the ACC implies stronger implicit emotion regulation induced by negative stimuli. This might be explained by emotional hyperresponsivity in patients with ADHD compared with controls. ",
pmid_21376126,Brain-behavior correlates of optimizing learning through interleaved practice.,,"Understanding how to make learning more efficient and effective is an important goal in behavioral neuroscience. The notion of ""desirable difficulties"" asserts that challenges for learners during study result in superior learning. One ""desirable difficulty"" that has a robust benefit on learning is contextual interference (CI), in which different tasks are practiced in an interleaved order rather than in a repetitive order. This study is the first to combine functional imaging and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation to analyze the neural basis of the CI effect in skill learning. Difficulty during practice of a serial reaction time task was manipulated by presenting sequences of response locations in a repetitive or an interleaved order. Participants practiced 3 sequences for 2 days and were tested on day 5 to examine sequence-specific learning. During practice, slower response times (RT), greater frontal-parietal blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal, and higher motor cortex (M1) excitability were found in the interleaved condition compared to the repetitive condition. Consistent with the CI effect, we found faster RT, decreased BOLD signal in frontal-parietal regions, and greater M1 excitability during the day 5 retention task when subjects had practiced interleaved sequences. Correlation analyses indicated that greater BOLD signal in contralateral sensorimotor region and M1 excitability during interleaved practice were interrelated. Furthermore, greater BOLD signal in prefrontal, premotor and parietal areas and greater M1 excitability during interleaved practice correlated with the benefit of interleaved practice on retention. This demonstrates that interleaved practice induces interrelated changes in both cortical hemodynamic responses and M1 excitability, which likely index the formation of enhanced memory traces and efficient long-term retrieval.

fMRI","Patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) suffer from poor emotion regulation that might arise from problems in the distribution of attentional resources when confronted with emotional distractors. Previous studies investigating the neurocognitive basis of these problems remain inconclusive. Moreover, most of these studies did not exclude participants with comorbidity, particularly of conduct or oppositional defiant disorder. The aim of this study was to assess alterations in fronto-limbic activation in ADHD adolescents specifically during negative distractors in an emotional attention task. For this purpose, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess 25 boys with noncomorbid ADHD and 25 typically developing (TD) boys while they performed an emotional attention task with positive, negative, and neutral emotional distractors. Boys with ADHD had increased activation relative to TD boys specifically during the negative valenced stimuli in an emotional processing network comprising left anterior insula reaching into the inferior frontal gyrus. The findings suggest altered salience processing in ADHD of negative valenced emotional stimuli that may lead to higher distractibility in ADHD specifically when faced with negative emotional distractors.

pmid_19378277,Comparing MEG and fMRI views to naming actions and objects.,,"Most neuroimaging studies are performed using one imaging method only, either functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), or magnetoencephalography (MEG). Information on both location and timing has been sought by recording fMRI and EEG, simultaneously, or MEG and fMRI in separate sessions. Such approaches assume similar active areas whether detected via hemodynamic or electrophysiological signatures. Direct comparisons, after independent analysis of data from each imaging modality, have been conducted primarily on low-level sensory processing. Here, we report MEG (timing and location) and fMRI (location) results in 11 subjects when they named pictures that depicted an action or an object. The experimental design was exactly the same for the two imaging modalities. The MEG data were analyzed with two standard approaches: a set of equivalent current dipoles and a distributed minimum norm estimate. The fMRI blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) data were subjected to the usual random-effect contrast analysis. At the group level, MEG and fMRI data showed fairly good convergence, with both overall activation patterns and task effects localizing to comparable cortical regions. There were some systematic discrepancies, however, and the correspondence was less compelling in the individual subjects. The present analysis should be helpful in reconciling results of fMRI and MEG studies on high-level cognitive functions. ",
pmid_21998078,Altered brain activation during response inhibition in children with primary nocturnal enuresis: an fMRI study.,,"Nocturnal enuresis is a common developmental disorder in children, and primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE) is the dominant subtype. The main purpose of this study was to investigate brain functional abnormalities specifically related to motor response inhibition in children with PNE using fMRI in combination with a Go/NoGo task. Twenty-two children with PNE and 22 healthy children, group-matched for age and sex, took part in this experiment. Although no significant between-group differences in task performance accuracy were observed, PNE patients showed significantly longer response times on average. There were several brain regions with reduced activation during motor response inhibition in children with PNE: the bilateral inferior frontal gyri, right superior and middle frontal gyri, right inferior parietal lobe, bilateral cingulate gyri and insula. Our data indicate that response inhibition in children with PNE is associated with a relative lack of or delay in the maturation of prefrontal cortex circuitry that is known to suppress inappropriate responses. This result might give clues to understanding the pathophysiology of PNE. ",

The discrete cosine transform and functional connectivity methods were adopted to detect the differences related with these two acupoints before and after the EAS. Spatial patterns were distinct for EAS at the two acupoints, and the overlapping brain regions were mainly located in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus (pC). Two opposite patterns of modulation in the default mode network were detected from the temporal patterns with the overlapping PCC/pC as the region of interest. Furthermore, the specific responses of sustained effects at these acupoints were also identified. Spatial and temporal patterns of the sustained effect modulation of GB37 and KI8 were distinct. We suggest these findings may attribute to the functional specificity of a certain acupoint. Moreover, our current results reflect a significant methodological contribution to future acupuncture studies. ",

In contrast to IPD, decreased or increased ALFF in different regions of visual associative cortices and decreased ALFF in right cerebellum were found in MSA group. Our findings suggested shared and distinct spontaneous brain activity abnormalities in striato-thalamo-cortical (STC) loop, default mood network, visual associative cortices and cerebellum were present in MSA and IPD, which may help to explain similar clinical symptoms in both disorders but a more severe illness prognosis in MSA.

Insula is functionally divided into 3 subregions, the dorsoanterior, the ventroanterior and the posterior insula respectively related to cognition, emotion, and somatosensory functions. This study aimed at investigating functional connectivity of insula subregions in MA. Twenty-one interictal patients with MA were compared to 18 healthy controls (HC) and 12 interictal patients with migraine without aura (MO) and were scanned with functional MRI during the resting state. Functional coupling of the insula was comprehensively tested with 12 seeds located in the right and left, dorsal, middle, ventral, anterior and posterior insula, by using a seed-to-voxel analysis. Seed-to-voxel analysis revealed, in MA, a strong functional coupling of the right and left antero-dorsal insula with clusters located in the upper cerebellum. The overlap of these cerebellar clusters corresponded to the vermis VI. These functional couplings were not correlated to duration of MA, frequency of MA attacks nor time since last MA attack, and were not found in MO. The anterior insula and superior cerebellum, including vermis VI, are components of the central Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) network. As these regions are involved in the control of cardiovascular parasympathetic tone, we hypothesize that this connectivity may reflect the cardiovascular features of MA. The anterior dorsal insula is connected with vermis VI in MA patients in the resting state. This connectivity may reflect the cardiovascular features of MA. NCT02708797. ",

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the effects of MPH in medication-naïve children with ADHD on the activation and functional connectivity of ""cool"" attentional as well as ""hot"" motivation networks. 13 medication-naïve children with ADHD were scanned twice, under either an acute clinical dose of MPH or Placebo, in a randomised, double-blind design, while they performed a rewarded continuous performance task that measured vigilant selective attention and the effects of reward. Brain activation and functional connectivity was compared to that of 13 healthy age-matched controls to test for normalisation effects of MPH. MPH normalised performance deficits that were observed in children with ADHD compared to controls. Under placebo, children with ADHD showed reduced activation and functional inter-connectivity in bilateral fronto-striato-parieto-cerebellar networks during the attention condition, but enhanced activation in the orbitofrontal and superior temporal cortices for reward. MPH within children with ADHD enhanced the activation of fronto-striato-cerebellar and parieto-temporal regions. Compared to controls, MPH normalised differences during vigilant attention in parieto-temporal activation and fronto-striatal and fronto-cerebellar connectivity; MPH also normalised the enhanced orbitofrontal activation in children with ADHD in response to reward. MPH normalised attention differences between children with ADHD and controls by both up-regulation of dysfunctional fronto-striato-thalamo-cerebellar and parieto-temporal attention networks and down-regulation of hyper-sensitive orbitofrontal activation for reward processing. MPH thus shows context-dependent dissociative modulation of both motivational and attentional neuro-functional networks in children with ADHD. ",

Tensor-Based Morphometry","Chronic alcohol consumption results in brain damage potentially reversible with abstinence. It is however difficult to gauge the degree of recovery of brain tissues with abstinence since changes are subtle and a significant portion of patients relapse. State-of-the-art morphometric methods are increasingly used in neuroimaging studies to detect subtle brain changes at a voxel level. Our aim was to use the most refined morphometric methods to observe in alcohol dependence the relationship between volumetric changes and interim drinking over a 6-month follow-up. Overall, 19 patients with alcohol dependence received volumetric T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after detoxification. A 6-month follow-up study was then conducted, during which 11 of them received a second MRI scan. First, correlations were conducted between gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes of patients at alcohol treatment entry and the amount of alcohol consumed between treatment entry and follow-up. Second, longitudinal analyses were performed from pairs of MRI scans using tensor-based morphometry in the 11 patients, and correlations were computed between the resultant Jacobian maps of GM and WM and interim drinking. Our preliminary results showed that, among others, alcoholics with smaller thalamus at alcohol treatment entry tended to resume with heavy alcohol consumption (p < 0.005 uncorrected [unc.]). Our longitudinal study revealed an overall inverse relationship between recovery of brain structures like the cerebellum, striatum, and cingulate gyrus, and the amount of alcohol consumed over the 6-month follow-up (p < 0.005 unc.). The recovery could be observed not only with strict abstinence but also in cases of moderate resumption of alcohol consumption, when there had been no drastic relapse into alcohol dependence. Those preliminary findings indicate that the volume of the thalamus at treatment entry may have an influence on subsequent interim drinking. There is recovery of certain brain regions even when patients resume with moderate, but not drastic, alcohol consumption. ",
pmid_22131304,Localization of pain-related brain activation: a meta-analysis of neuroimaging data.,,"A meta-analysis of 140 neuroimaging studies was performed using the activation-likelihood-estimate (ALE) method to explore the location and extent of activation in the brain in response to noxious stimuli in healthy volunteers. The first analysis involved the creation of a likelihood map illustrating brain activation common across studies using noxious stimuli. The left thalamus, right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), bilateral anterior insulae, and left dorsal posterior insula had the highest likelihood of being activated. The second analysis contrasted noxious cold with noxious heat stimulation and revealed higher likelihood of activation to noxious cold in the subgenual ACC and the amygdala. The third analysis assessed the implications of using either a warm stimulus or a resting baseline as the control condition to reveal activation attributed to noxious heat. Comparing noxious heat to warm stimulation led to peak ALE values that were restricted to cortical regions with known nociceptive input. The fourth analysis tested for a hemispheric dominance in pain processing and showed the importance of the right hemisphere, with the strongest ALE peaks and clusters found in the right insula and ACC. The fifth analysis compared noxious muscle with cutaneous stimuli and the former type was more likely to evoke activation in the posterior and anterior cingulate cortices, precuneus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and cerebellum. In general, results indicate that some brain regions such as the thalamus, insula and ACC have a significant likelihood of activation regardless of the type of noxious stimuli, while other brain regions show a stimulus-specific likelihood of being activated.

This study aims to analyze these possible mechanisms by comparing the effect of IA severity and childhood ADHD on inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity in young adults with IA. We hypothesized that IA might have associations with ADHD-like cognitive and behavior symptoms aside from childhood ADHD. Methods Study participants consisted of 61 young male adults. Participants were administered a structured interview. The severity of IA, childhood and current ADHD symptoms, and psychiatry comorbid symptoms were assessed through self-rating scales. The associations between the severity of IA and ADHD symptoms were examined through hierarchical regression analyses. Results Hierarchical regression analyses showed that the severity of IA significantly predicted most dimensions of ADHD symptoms. By contrast, childhood ADHD predicted only one dimension. Discussion The high comorbidity of inattention and hyperactivity symptoms in IA should not solely be accounted by an independent ADHD disorder but should consider the possibility of cognitive symptoms related to IA. Functional and structural brain abnormalities associated with excessive and pathologic Internet usage might be related to these ADHD-like symptoms. Conclusion Inattention and hyperactivity in young adults with IA are more significantly associated with the severity of IA than that of childhood ADHD. ",
pmid_25071023,GLP-1 receptor activation modulates appetite- and reward-related brain areas in humans.,,"Gut-derived hormones, such as GLP-1, have been proposed to relay information to the brain to regulate appetite. GLP-1 receptor agonists, currently used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), improve glycemic control and stimulate satiety, leading to decreases in food intake and body weight. We hypothesized that food intake reduction after GLP-1 receptor activation is mediated through appetite- and reward-related brain areas. Obese T2DM patients and normoglycemic obese and lean individuals (n = 48) were studied in a randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled trial. Using functional MRI, we determined the acute effects of intravenous administration of the GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide, with or without prior GLP-1 receptor blockade using exendin 9-39, on brain responses to food pictures during a somatostatin pancreatic-pituitary clamp. Obese T2DM patients and normoglycemic obese versus lean subjects showed increased brain responses to food pictures in appetite- and reward-related brain regions (insula and amygdala). Exenatide versus placebo decreased food intake and food-related brain responses in T2DM patients and obese subjects (in insula, amygdala, putamen, and orbitofrontal cortex). These effects were largely blocked by prior GLP-1 receptor blockade using exendin 9-39. Our findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms by which GLP-1 regulates food intake and how GLP-1 receptor agonists cause weight loss. ",

In a cross-sectional study, we analyzed the brain structural impairments of outpatients with schizophrenia using concurrent subgrouping methods, partly to enhance the extensity of exploration, and partly to estimate the validation of the divisions. High resolution T1-weighted MR images were obtained for 21 patients and 13 healthy controls. Localized gray matter volumetric deficits were defined with optimized voxel-based morphometry. Employing two concurrent methods (i.e., the widely known deficit-non-deficit division vs. the neurocognitive clusters we identified earlier) the patient group was iteratively divided into two subgroups, and their volumetric peculiarities were compared with one another and with healthy controls. Our division revealed more significant differences demonstrating bilateral brain structural deficits, which affected the association cortices, primarily the heteromodal fields and partly the unimodal fields. This is the first study that showed that abnormalities of the association cortices can be bihemispherial and expanded in schizophrenia, even in the cases of outpatients living integrated in society. Our result suggests that the extended association cortex abnormalities could constitute substantial and determining neurological substrates in the phenomenology and aetiopathogenesis of schizophrenia, at least in a subgroup of patients with more unfavorable neurocognitive characteristics.

reappraisal","One of the most effective strategies for regulating emotional responses is cognitive reappraisal. While prior work has made great strides in characterizing reappraisal's neural mechanisms and behavioral outcomes, the key issue of how regulation varies as a function of emotional intensity remains unaddressed. We compared the behavioral and neural correlates of reappraisal of high- and low-intensity emotional responses using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found that successful reappraisal of both high- and low-intensity emotions depends upon recruitment of dorsomedial (dmPFC) as well as left dorsolateral (dlPFC) and ventrolateral (vlPFC) prefrontal cortex. However, reappraisal of high-intensity emotions more strongly activated left dlPFC, and in addition, activated right lateral and dorsomedial PFC regions not recruited by low-intensity reappraisal. No brain regions were more strongly recruited during reappraisal of low when compared with high-intensity emotions. Taken together, these results suggest that reappraisal of high-intensity emotion requires greater cognitive resources as evidenced by quantitative and qualitative differences in prefrontal recruitment. These data have implications for understanding how and when specific PFC systems are needed to regulate different types of emotional responses. ",
pmid_17958479,Neural correlates of verb argument structure processing.,,"Neuroimaging and lesion studies suggest that processing of word classes, such as verbs and nouns, is associated with distinct neural mechanisms. Such studies also suggest that subcategories within these broad word class categories are differentially processed in the brain. Within the class of verbs, argument structure provides one linguistic dimension that distinguishes among verb exemplars, with some requiring more complex argument structure entries than others. This study examined the neural instantiation of verbs by argument structure complexity: one-, two-, and three-argument verbs. Stimuli of each type, along with nouns and pseudowords, were presented for lexical decision using an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging design. Results for 14 young normal participants indicated largely overlapping activation maps for verbs and nouns, with no areas of significant activation for verbs compared to nouns, or vice versa. Pseudowords also engaged neural tissue overlapping with that for both word classes, with more widespread activation noted in visual, motor, and peri-sylvian regions. Examination of verbs by argument structure revealed activation of the supramarginal and angular gyri, limited to the left hemisphere only when verbs with two obligatory arguments were compared to verbs with a single argument. However, bilateral activation was noted when both two- and three-argument verbs were compared to one-argument verbs. These findings suggest that posterior peri-sylvian regions are engaged for processing argument structure information associated with verbs, with increasing neural tissue in the inferior parietal region associated with increasing argument structure complexity. These findings are consistent with processing accounts, which suggest that these regions are crucial for semantic integration. ",

Error processing is a central aspect of inhibitory control that determines adaptive adjustment of performance; yet it is a largely overlooked aspect of disinhibition as it relates to risk for SUD. We investigated whether differences in brain activation during both successful and failed inhibition predicts early problem substance use. Forty-five 9-12 year olds underwent a functional MRI scan during a go/no-go task. They were then followed over approximately 4 years, completing assessments of substance use. Externalizing behavior was measured at ages 3-8, 9-12 and 11-13. Participants with drug use or problem alcohol use by ages 13-16 (n=13; problem-user group) were individually matched by gender, age, and family history of alcoholism with non-substance-using children (n=13; non-user group). The remaining 19 participants provided an independent sample from which to generate unbiased regions-of-interest for hypothesis testing in the problem-user and non-user groups. No differences were observed between groups in activation during correct inhibition compared with baseline. A significant difference arose in left middle frontal gyrus (LMFG) activation during failed inhibition compared with correct inhibition, with the problem-user group demonstrating blunted activation. The problem-user group also had more externalizing problems at ages 11-13. Logistic regression found that activation of LMFG significantly predicted group membership over and above externalizing problems. Blunted LMFG activation during performance errors may underlie problems adapting behavior appropriately, leading to undercontrolled behavior, early problem substance use and increased risk for SUD.

pmid_21795615,Functional magnetic resonance adaptation reveals the involvement of the dorsomedial stream in hand orientation for grasping.,,"Reach-to-grasp actions require coordination of different segments of the upper limbs. Previous studies have examined the neural substrates of arm transport and hand grip components of such actions; however, a third component has been largely neglected: the orientation of the wrist and hand appropriately for the object. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation (fMRA) to investigate human brain areas involved in processing hand orientation during grasping movements. Participants used the dominant right hand to grasp a rod with the four fingers opposing the thumb or to reach and touch the rod with the knuckles without visual feedback. In a control condition, participants passively viewed the rod. Trials in a slow event-related design consisted of two sequential stimuli in which the rod orientation changed (requiring a change in wrist posture while grasping but not reaching or looking) or remained the same. We found reduced activation, that is, adaptation, in superior parieto-occipital cortex (SPOC) when the object was repeatedly grasped with the same orientation. In contrast, there was no adaptation when reaching or looking at an object in the same orientation, suggesting that hand orientation, rather than object orientation, was the critical factor. These results agree with recent neurophysiological research showing that a parieto-occipital area of macaque (V6A) is modulated by hand orientation during reach-to-grasp movements. We suggest that the human dorsomedial stream, like that in the macaque, plays a key role in processing hand orientation in reach-to-grasp movements. ",

Type 2 diabetes","It is now generally accepted that diabetes increases the risk for cognitive impairment, but the precise mechanisms are poorly understood. In recent years, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is increasingly used to investigate the neural basis of cognitive dysfunction in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. Alterations in brain functional connectivity may underlie diabetes-related cognitive dysfunction and brain damage. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in default mode network (DMN) connectivity in different glucose metabolism status and diabetes duration. We used a seed-based fMRI analysis to investigate positive and negative DMN connectivity in four groups (39 subjects with normal glucose metabolism [NGM], 23 subjects with impaired glucose metabolism [IGM; i.e., prediabetes], 59 T2D patients with a diabetes duration of <10 years, and 24 T2D patients with a diabetes duration of ≥10 years). Negative DMN connectivity increased and then regressed with deteriorating glucose metabolism status and extending diabetes duration. DMN connectivity showed a significant correlation with diabetes duration. This study suggests that DMN connectivity may exhibit distinct patterns in different glucose metabolism status and diabetes duration, providing some potential neuroimaging evidence for early diagnosis and further understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of diabetic brain damage.

pmid_19931397,Social cognition and the anterior temporal lobes.,,"Two distinct literatures have emerged on the functionality of the anterior temporal lobes (ATL): in one field, the ATLs are conceived of as a repository for semantic or conceptual knowledge. In another field, the ATLs are thought to play some undetermined role in social-emotional functions such as Theory of Mind. Here we attempted to reconcile these distinct functions by assessing whether social semantic processing can explain ATL activation in other social cognitive tasks. Social semantic functions refer to knowledge about social concepts and rules. In a first experiment we tested the idea that social semantic representations can account for activations in the ATL to social attribution stimuli such as Heider and Simmel animations. Left ATL activations to Heider and Simmel stimuli overlapped with activations to social words. In a second experiment we assessed the putative roles of the ATLs in the processing of narratives and theory of mind content and found evidence for a role of the ATLs in the processing of theory of mind but not narrative per se. These findings indicate that the ATLs are part of a neuronal network supporting social cognition and that they are engaged when tasks demand access to social conceptual knowledge. ",

vegetative state","The vegetative state (VS) is characterized by the absence of awareness of self or the environment and preserved autonomic functions. The diagnosis relies critically on the lack of consistent signs of purposeful behavior in response to external stimulation. Yet, given that patients with disorders of consciousness often exhibit fragmented movement patterns, voluntary actions may go unnoticed. Here we designed a simple motor paradigm that could potentially detect signs of purposeful behavior in VS patients with mild to severe brain damage by examining the neural correlates of motor preparation in response to verbal commands. Twenty-four patients who met the diagnostic criteria for VS were recruited for this study. Eleven of these patients showing preserved auditory evoked potentials underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test for basic speech processing. Five of these patients, who showed word related activity, were included in a second fMRI study aimed at detecting functional changes in premotor cortex elicited by specific verbal instructions to move either their left or their right hand. Despite the lack of overt muscle activity, two patients out of five activated the dorsal premotor cortex contralateral to the instructed hand, consistent with movement preparation. Our results may reflect residual voluntary processing in these two patients. We believe that the identification of positive results with fMRI using this simple task, may complement the clinical assessment by helping attain a more precise diagnosis in patients with disorders of consciousness.

Here, we consider key conceptual issues that have impeded progress in our understanding of hippocampal function, and we review findings that establish the scope and limits of hippocampal involvement in navigation and memory. We argue that space and time serve as a primary scaffold to break up experiences into specific contexts, and to organize multimodal input that is to be associated within a context. However, the hippocampus is clearly capable of incorporating additional dimensions into the scaffold if they are determined to be relevant in the event-defined context. Conceiving of the hippocampal representation as constrained by immediate task demands-yet preferring axes that involve space and time-helps to reconcile an otherwise disparate set of findings on the core function of the hippocampus.

VBM studies demonstrate structural alterations of gray matter (GM) in episodic migraine (EM) patients. Some of these alterations correlate with disease duration and headache frequency. We assessed GM alterations in chronic migraine (CM) and EM to evaluate the concept of migraine as a progressive disorder of the brain. Individually age and sex-matched subjects with CM or EM (both without aura) and healthy controls (n = 21 per group) underwent magnetic resonance imaging-based VBM. We found an increase of GM volume (GMV) in amygdala and putamen, in CM compared to controls. GMV of EM compared to controls did not differ statistically significantly. Headache frequency in all migraineurs (EM and CM) correlated positively with GMV in putamen, frontal and temporal gyrus and negatively in left cuneus. CM is associated with structural changes in brain regions involved in pain processing but also in affective and cognitive aspects of pain. Some GM alterations are correlated with headache frequency assessed in EM and CM. The findings support the assumption that chronic pain alters brain plasticity. GMV increase may reflect a remodeling of the central nervous system due to repetitive headache attacks leading to chronic sensitization and a continuous ictal-like state of the brain in chronic migraineurs.

pmid_23840533,Manipulation of and sustained effects on the human brain induced by different modalities of acupuncture: an fMRI study.,,"The javascript:void(0)manipulation and sustained effects of acupuncture have been investigated in multiple studies, but several findings are inconsistent with one another. One possible explanation for these discrepancies is that different modalities of acupuncture were utilized in these studies. In the present study, we investigated both the manipulation and sustained effects of acupuncture in different modalities, including manual acupuncture (MA), electroacupuncture (EA) and transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS). MA, EA, TEAS and sensory control stimulation were applied to 18 healthy subjects, and combined block-designed and resting-state fMRI scans were performed. In analyzing these data, the block-designed datasets were used to assess the manipulation effect by employing a modified general linear model. The data from the resting states, before and after stimulation, were used to explore the brain networks involved in the sustained effect. The results showed that the two 1-min stimulation periods produced similar activation patterns in the sensory control with positive activation in the sensorimotor areas and negative activation in the default mode areas. Although similar patterns could be detected in the first stimulation period in MA, EA and TEAS, no positive activation result was observed in the second stimulation period, and EA showed a more extensive deactivation compared to MA and TEAS. Additionally, all three of the modalities of acupuncture stimulation could increase the instinct brain network in rest. A more secure and spatially extended connectivity of the default mode network was observed following MA and EA, and TEAS specifically increased the functional connectivity in the sensorimotor network. The present study suggested that different brain mechanisms might be recruited in different acupuncture modalities. In addition, the findings from our work could provide methodological information for further research into the mechanism of acupuncture. ",
pmid_22835912,Abnormal neural activity of brain regions in treatment-resistant and treatment-sensitive major depressive disorder: a resting-state fMRI study.,,"Patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and those with treatment-sensitive depression (TSD) responded to antidepressants differently. Previous studies have commonly shown that patients with TRD or TSD had abnormal neural activity in different brain regions. In the present study, we used a coherence-based ReHo (Cohe-ReHo) approach to test the hypothesis that patients with TRD or TSD had abnormal neural activity in different brain regions. Twenty-three patients with TRD, 22 with TSD, and 19 healthy subjects (HS) matched with gender, age, and education level participated in the study. ANOVA analysis revealed widespread differences in Cohe-ReHo values among the three groups in different brain regions which included bilateral superior frontal gyrus, bilateral cerebellum, left inferior temporal gyrus, left occipital cortex, and both sides of fusiform gyrus. Compared to HS, lower Cohe-ReHo values were observed in TRD group in bilateral superior frontal gyrus and left cerebellum; in contrast, in TSD group, lower Cohe-ReHo values were mainly found in bilateral superior frontal gyrus. Compared to TSD group, TRD group had lower Cohe-ReHo in bilateral cerebellum and higher Cohe-ReHo in left fusiform gyrus. There was a negative correlation between Cohe-ReHo values of the left fusiform gyrus and illness duration in the pooled patients (r = 0.480, p = 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of cerebellar Cohe-ReHo values differentiating TRD from TSD were 83% and 86%, respectively. Compared to healthy controls, both TRD and TSD patients shared the majority of brain regions with abnormal neural activity. However, the lower Cohe-ReHo values in the cerebellum might be as a marker to differentiate TRD from TSD with high sensitivity and specificity. ",

resting-state fMRI","Analysis of the amplitude of low frequency BOLD signal fluctuations (ALFF) in the resting state has recently been used to study the dynamics of intrinsic neural activity. Several studies have also suggested its potential as a biomarker for neuropsychiatric disease. In the current study, we quantified ALFF to determine changes in intrinsic neural oscillations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) on and off L-DOPA. Twenty-four PD patients and 24 healthy age-matched controls participated in the study. PD patients underwent two resting state fMRI sessions, either ON a controlled dose of L-DOPA or following a placebo pill (OFF). Control participants underwent one test session. We found that there was increased amplitude of low frequency BOLD signal oscillations for PD patients OFF L-DOPA in the primary and secondary motor areas, and in the middle and medial prefrontal cortices. L-DOPA significantly reduced the amplitude of low frequency oscillations within these regions. The degree of ALFF in the premotor cortex predicted patients' motor performance as measured by the Grooved Pegboard task, such that greater ALFF was associated with poorer performance. These results are in line with the pathophysiology of PD, which shows changes in neural oscillations. Thus, frequency domain analyses of resting state BOLD fMRI signals may provide a useful means to study the pathophysiology of PD and the physiology of the brain's dopaminergic pathways. ",

The cerebellar compensatory response is defined as a cerebellar hyperactivity which would be inversely correlated with both the activation of the functionally connected cerebral regions and the depression severity. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of 24 patients with MDD and 24 healthy subjects were analyzed with the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) and functional connectivity (FC) methods. The structural images were processed with the voxel-based morphometry (VBM) method. Compared to healthy controls, depressed patients had significantly increased fALFF in the left Crus I and the left cerebellar lobule VI. FC analysis of these two seeded regions found that depressed patients had increased FC between the left Crus I and the right hippocampus, but had decreased FC between the left Crus I and the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and between the left cerebellar lobule VI and bilateral inferior temporal gyrus. No correlation was observed between the abnormal fALFF of the seeds and their connected regions and the depression severity or the executive function. The VBM results did not show significant reduction in gray or white matter volume in any above-mentioned region. Our findings suggest that increased cerebellar activity at resting state may be a disease state phenomenon but not a compensatory response to the dysfunction of the default mode network (DMN) in MDD.

We compared brain activity with dynamic and static facial expressions in participants with and without high-functioning autism using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and three classes of face stimuli-emotion morphs (fearful and angry), identity morphs and static images (fearful, angry and neutral). We observed reduced activity in the amygdala (AMY) and fusiform gyrus (FFG) to dynamic emotional expressions in people with autism. There was also a lack of modulation by dynamic compared with static emotional expressions of social brain regions including the AMY, posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) region and FFG. We observed equivalent emotion and identity morph-evoked activity in participants with and without autism in a region corresponding to the expected location of the more generally motion-sensitive area MT or V5. We conclude that dysfunctions in key components of the human face processing system including the AMY, FFG and posterior STS region are present in individuals with high-functioning autism, and this dysfunction might contribute to the deficits in processing emotional facial expressions.

pmid_20603454,Neural abnormalities in early-onset and adolescence-onset conduct disorder.,,"Conduct disorder (CD) is characterized by severe antisocial behavior that emerges in childhood (early-onset CD [EO-CD]) or adolescence (adolescence-onset CD [AO-CD]). Early-onset CD is proposed to have a neurodevelopmental basis, whereas AO-CD is thought to emerge owing to social mimicry of deviant peers. However, this developmental taxonomic theory is debated after reports of neuropsychological impairments in both CD subtypes. A critical, although unaddressed, issue is whether these subtypes present similar or distinct neurophysiological profiles. Hence, we investigated neurophysiological responses to emotional and neutral faces in regions associated with antisocial behavior (ie, the amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex) in individuals with EO-CD and AO-CD and in healthy control subjects. To investigate whether EO-CD and AO-CD subjects show neurophysiological abnormalities. Case-control study. Government research institute, university department. Seventy-five male adolescents and young adults aged 16 to 21 years, including 27 with EO-CD, 25 with AO-CD, and 23 healthy controls. Main Outcome Measure Neural activations measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants viewed angry, sad, and neutral faces. Comparing angry vs neutral faces, participants with both CD subtypes displayed reduced responses in regions associated with antisocial behavior compared with controls; differences between the CD subtypes were not significant. Comparing each expression with fixation baseline revealed an abnormal (increased) amygdala response to neutral but not angry faces in both groups of CD relative to controls. For sad vs neutral faces, reduced amygdala activation was observed in EO-CD relative to AO-CD and control participants. Comparing each expression with fixation revealed hypoactive amygdala responses to sadness in individuals with EO-CD relative to AO-CD participants and controls. These findings were not accounted for by attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms. Neurophysiological abnormalities are observed in both CD subtypes, contrary to the developmental taxonomic theory of CD. Additional amygdala hypofunction in relation to sad expressions might indicate why EO-CD is more severe and persistent than AO-CD. ",
pmid_15050577,Neural representations of nouns and verbs in Chinese: an fMRI study.,,"The neural representation of nouns and verbs has been a focus of many recent neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies. These studies have in general found that in English and other Indo-European languages, verbs are represented in the frontal region (e.g., the left prefrontal cortex) while nouns in the posterior regions (the temporal-occipital regions). There is accumulating evidence, however, that the picture may have been overly simplified. In the present study, we examine the representations of nouns and verbs in Chinese, a language that has unique properties in its grammar and particularly in the structure of nouns and verbs. In an fMRI experiment, subjects viewed a list of disyllabic nouns, verbs, and class-ambiguous words and performed a lexical decision on the target. Results from the experiment indicate that nouns and verbs in Chinese activate a wide range of overlapping brain areas in distributed networks, in both the left and the right hemispheres. The results provide support for the prediction regarding the impact of linguistic typology and language-specific influences on the neural representation of grammatical categories. They are consistent with recent proposals that specific linguistic experience shapes neural systems of reading and speaking and that the language-specific properties of the Chinese grammar affect the representation, processing, and acquisition in this language.

It's a case-control study. We analyzed the resting-state brain functional magnetic resonance imaging in 19 patients with episodes, 22 patients with interictal phase, and 22 healthy controls. The ReHo method was used for post-processing. All subjects were evaluated using the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) scale, simple mental state examination (MMSE), Hamilton anxiety (HAMA) scale, and Hamilton depression (HAMD) scale. The subjects' clinical indicators (such as frequency of attack, course of disease, duration of each headache, and severity of headache) were correlated with the ReHo values of brain regions. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Yangtze River Shipping General Hospital. Compared with the interictal, patients in the episode group had lower activation in bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), with Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) (-9, 42, 15); and had stronger activation in bilateral paracentral lobule (PCL), with MNI (-3, -24, 66). Compared with the control group, patients in interictal phase had lower activation in the bilateral cuneus and bilateral lingual gyrus, with MNI scores of (9, -84, 36) and (0, -72, 6), respectively. No significant difference in brain area was found between the episodes group and the control group. In the episodes group, a significant correlation was observed between attack frequency and ReHo value of the bilateral PCL (r=0.492; P=0.038). We need to observe the course of migraine as a whole. In the interictal period, the cuneus and lingual gyrus may affect the development of the disease. The ACC regulates different states of migraine by inducing anti-injury sensation regulation function. The paracentric lobule is not only associated with migraine attacks, but also with the frequency. This may have an effect on the outcome of subsequent migraines, as well as whether the condition becomes chronic, and the remodeling of the brain. ",

The craving response was assessed by event-related design of functional magnetic resonance images (fMRIs). Fifteen subjects with IGA, 15 in remission from IGA and 15 controls were recruited in this study. The subjects were arranged to view the gaming screenshots and neutral images under investigation of fMRIs. The results showed that bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), precuneus, left parahippocampus, posterior cingulate and right anterior cingulate were activated in response to gaming cues in the IGA group and their activation was stronger in the IGA group than those in the control group. Their region-of-interest was also positively correlated with subjective gaming urge under cue exposure. These activated brain areas represent the brain circuit corresponding to the mechanism of substance use disorder. Thus, it would suggest that the mechanism of IGA is similar to substance use disorder. Furthermore, the IGA group had stronger activation over right DLPFC and left parahippocampus than did the remission group. The two areas would be candidate markers for current addiction to online gaming and should be investigated in future studies. ",

We compared internet gaming use patterns and sociodemographic and clinical variables between patients with internet gaming disorder who had depression and those without depression. In 2016, 7200 people participated in an online survey. Respondents with internet gaming disorder that was comorbid with depression were older, more often female, had greater Internet Addiction Test total scores, Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test total scores, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 total scores, Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence total scores, and higher Dickman Dysfunctional Impulsivity Instrument dysfunctional subscale scores than those without depression. The binary logistic regression analysis revealed that female gender, problematic alcohol use, anxiety, and a past history of psychiatric counseling or treatment due to internet gaming use were significant predictors for comorbid depression among participants with internet gaming disorder. Depression was a common comorbidity of internet gaming disorder. Internet gaming disorder with comorbid depression was related to more serious psychiatric phenomenology and a greater psychiatric burden. ",

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) has demonstrated evidence of changes in metabolic patterns in individuals with PD. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the presence of PD could be ""predicted"" based on resting fluctuations in the blood oxygenation level dependent signal. We utilized RS-fMRI to measure the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and the fractional ALFF (fALFF) in 51 patients with PD and 50 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Compared with the healthy controls, the individuals with PD exhibited altered ALFFs in the bilateral lingual gyrus and left putamen and an altered fALFF in the right cerebellum posterior lobe. Support vector machines (SVMs), which comprise a supervised pattern recognition method that enables predictions at the individual level, were trained to separate individuals with PD from healthy controls based on the ALFF and fALFF. Using the leave-one-out cross-validation method to analyze our sample, we reliably distinguished the participants with PD from the controls with 92% sensitivity and 87% specificity. Overall, these findings suggest that the SVM-neuroimaging approach may be of particular clinical value because it enables the accurate identification of PD at the individual level. RS-fMRI should be considered for development as a biomarker and an analytical tool for the evaluation of PD. ",

However, whether the functional architecture of PCun is shared by humans and macaques is an open question. We used both anatomical connectivity and task-dependent coactivation patterns to parcellate the human PCun and consistently identified three subregions in the human PCun using two independent datasets. Two subregions were located in the dorsal PCun and one subregion was located in the ventral PCun. This parcellation scheme for the PCun was supported by identifying the subregion-specific networks and by functional characterization. Then, the absolute and relative gray matter volume of precuneus in human and macaque was calculated and significantly smaller absolute and relative gray matter volume in macaque was identified. Next, three macaque PCun subregions were defined based on our tractographic atlas. Finally, the whole brain anatomical connectivity patterns and connectivity fingerprints with 17 predefined homologous target brain areas were mapped for each PCun subregion and revealed that the PCun shares similar anatomical connectivity patterns in humans and macaques. The similar anatomical connectivity patterns of PCun were validated by an independent in-house dataset. Our findings demonstrated that anatomical connectivity patterns can reflect the functional architecture of the PCun in humans and that the functional architecture of the PCun is similar in humans and macaques.

Previous neuroimaging research works have investigated the neural correlates of an overall deqi response by summating the scores of different needling sensations. However, the roles of individual sensations in brain activity and how they interact with each other remain to be clarified. In this study, we applied fMRI to investigate the neural correlates of individual components of deqi during acupuncture on the right LV3 (Taichong) acupoint. We selected a subset of deqi responses, namely, pressure, heaviness, fullness, numbness, and tingling. Using the individual components of deqi of different subjects as covariates in the analysis of percentage change of bold signal, pressure was found to be a striking sensation, contributing to most of negative activation of a limbic-paralimbic-neocortical network (LPNN). The similar or opposite neural activity in the heavily overlapping regions is found to be responding to different needling sensations, including bilateral LPNN, right orbitofrontal cortex, and bilateral posterior parietal cortex. These findings provide the neuroimaging evidence of how the individual needle sensations interact in the brain, showing that the modulatory effects of different needling sensations contribute to acupuncture modulations of LPNN network.

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of short-term overfeeding on the neuronal response to food-related visual stimuli in individuals prone and resistant to weight gain. 22 thin and 19 reduced-obese (RO) individuals were studied. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed in the fasted state after two days of eucaloric energy intake and after two days of 30% overfeeding in a counterbalanced design. fMRI was performed while subjects viewed images of foods of high hedonic value and neutral non-food objects. In the eucaloric state, food as compared to non-food images elicited significantly greater activation of insula and inferior visual cortex in thin as compared to RO individuals. Two days of overfeeding led to significant attenuation of not only insula and visual cortex responses but also of hypothalamus response in thin as compared to RO individuals. These findings emphasize the important role of food-related visual cues in ingestive behavior and suggest that there are important phenotypic differences in the interactions between external visual sensory inputs, energy balance status, and brain regions involved in the regulation of energy intake. Furthermore, alterations in the neuronal response to food cues may relate to the propensity to gain weight. ",

Ten drCCH patients underwent an 18FDG-PET scan after ONS, at delays varying between 0 and 30 months. All were scanned with ongoing ONS (ON) and with the stimulator switched OFF. After 6-30 months of ONS, 3 patients were pain free and 4 had a ≥ 90% reduction of attack frequency (responders). In all patients compared to controls, several areas of the pain matrix showed hypermetabolism: ipsilateral hypothalamus, midbrain and ipsilateral lower pons. All normalized after ONS, except for the hypothalamus. Switching the stimulator ON or OFF had little influence on brain glucose metabolism. The perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (PACC) was hyperactive in ONS responders compared to non-responders. Metabolic normalization in the pain neuromatrix and lack of short-term changes induced by the stimulation might support the hypothesis that ONS acts in drCCH through slow neuromodulatory processes. Selective activation in responders of PACC, a pivotal structure in the endogenous opioid system, suggests that ONS could restore balance within dysfunctioning pain control centres. That ONS is nothing but a symptomatic treatment might be illustrated by the persistent hypothalamic hypermetabolism, which could explain why autonomic attacks may persist despite pain relief and why cluster attacks recur shortly after stimulator arrest. PET studies on larger samples are warranted to confirm these first results. ",

prolonged disorder of consciousness","Acupuncture is a promising non-pharmacological therapy for patients with prolonged disorder of consciousness (PDOC); however, its underlying mechanism remains uncertain. This study aimed to reveal the modulatory effects of acupuncture on the cerebral cortex activity among patients with PDOC. Twenty-eight PDOC patients were randomly assigned to the treatment ( Compared to the control group, a single session of acupuncture significantly tended to enhance resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in DLPFC-M1, DLPFC-M1, and S1-S1. And the activation level of the DLPFC (both sides) in the acupuncture group is significantly higher than those in sham acupuncture group. However, no significant correlation was found between the consciousness level and activation response/functional connectivity. One session of acupuncture has a significant modulation of rsFC and activation in the DLPFC, M1, and S1 with PDOC patients. Acupuncture-evoked effect may have some functional significance in PDOC patients. This is an important step toward exploring the acupuncture effects on PDOC patients. ",

Participants perform the sequential risk-taking task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. In the task, participants opened a series of boxes consecutively and decided when to stop. Each box contained a reward, except for one which contained a devil. If the devil was revealed, then this served to zero the participant's gain in that trial. Once stopped, participant's gains and missed chances were revealed. Behaviorally, the Tai Chi group showed less regret, reduced risk taking, higher levels of nonjudgment of inner experience and less emotional sensitivity to outcome. fMRI results showed that the Tai Chi group demonstrated stronger fronto-striatal functional connectivity in trials with numerous missed chances. The nonjudgment of inner experience mediated the impact of fronto-striatal functional connectivity on Tai Chi practitioners' emotional sensitivity to outcome. These results highlight that long-term Tai Chi exercise may be effective in alleviating feelings of regret in elders by promoting reduced judgment of inner experience and enhanced emotion regulation through the strengthening of fronto-striatal functional connectivity.

A total of 31 subjects (15 females and 16 males) with type‑2 diabetic VH and 31 normal controls (NCs) with similar characteristics (sex, age and educational level) were recruited in the present study. All subjects underwent resting‑state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. The local character of spontaneous brain activity was assessed using the ALFF method. The difference between the type‑2 diabetic patients with VH and NCs was determined using receiver operating characteristic curves. Pearson's correlation analysis was applied to evaluate the relationship between the mean ALFF values of specific brain areas and related clinical manifestations in type‑2 diabetic patients with VH. The ALFF values of type‑2 diabetic patients with VH were significantly increased in the right and left cerebellum posterior lobes, left cerebellum posterior lobe/left lingual gyrus and bilateral superior frontal gyrus/left postcentral gyrus, compared with those obtained for NCs (P<0.05). By contrast, these values were significantly decreased in the left and right middle frontal gyri, right medial frontal gyrus/left anterior cingulate, right inferior frontal gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus/middle frontal gyrus and left middle frontal gyrus of the former group compared with the NCs (P<0.05). Nevertheless, there was no significant association between the mean ALFF values and clinical characteristics in different brain areas. Unusual spontaneous activity occurred in multiple brain areas, which may suggest the neuropathological mechanisms of visual impairment in type‑2 diabetic patients with VH. ",
pmid_24708897,Decision-making after continuous wins or losses in a randomized guessing task: implications for how the prior selection results affect subsequent decision-making.,,"Human decision-making is often affected by prior selections and their outcomes, even in situations where decisions are independent and outcomes are unpredictable. In this study, we created a task that simulated real-life non-strategic gambling to examine the effect of prior outcomes on subsequent decisions in a group of male college students. Behavioral performance showed that participants needed more time to react after continuous losses (LOSS) than continuous wins (WIN) and discontinuous outcomes (CONTROL). In addition, participants were more likely to repeat their selections in both WIN and LOSS conditions. Functional MRI data revealed that decisions in WINs were associated with increased activation in the mesolimbic pathway, but decreased activation in the inferior frontal gyrus relative to LOSS. Increased prefrontal cortical activation was observed during LOSS relative to WIN and CONTROL conditions. Taken together, the behavioral and neuroimaging findings suggest that participants tended to repeat previous selections during LOSS trials, a pattern resembling the gambler's fallacy. However, during WIN trials, participants tended to follow their previous lucky decisions, like the 'hot hand' fallacy. ",
pmid_17728263,Decomposing the neural correlates of antisaccade eye movements using event-related FMRI.,,"The antisaccade task is a model of the conflict between an unwanted reflexive response (which must be inhibited) and a complex volitional response (which must be generated). The present experiment aimed to investigate separately the neural correlates of these cognitive components using a delayed saccade paradigm to dissociate saccade inhibition from generation. Seventeen healthy volunteers completed event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging at 1.5 T during saccades to and away from a peripheral visual target (prosaccades and antisaccades, respectively). Saccades were requested in response to an auditory go signal on average 12 s after peripheral target appearance. It was found that the right supramarginal gyrus showed significantly greater activation during the inhibition phase than the generation phase of the paradigm for both antisaccade and prosaccade trials, suggesting a role in saccade inhibition or stimulus detection. On the other hand, the right lateral frontal eye field and bilateral intraparietal sulcus showed evidence of selective involvement in antisaccade generation. Ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices showed comparable levels of activation in both phases of the task. These areas likely fulfill a more general supervisory role in the volitional control of eye movements, such as stimulus appraisal, task set, and decision making. ",

For implicit learning, they were naive about a repeating pattern, whereas for explicit learning, participants memorized another repeating sequence. fMRI analyses comparing repeating versus random sequence blocks demonstrated activation of frontal, parietal, cingulate, and striatal regions implicated in previous SRTT studies. Importantly, mediotemporal lobe regions were active in both explicit and implicit SRTT learning. Moreover, the results provide evidence of a role for the hippocampus and related cortices in the formation of higher order associations under both implicit and explicit learning conditions, regardless of conscious awareness of sequence knowledge.

decoy effect
inhibitory control","Both humans and animals are known to exhibit a violation of rationality known as ""decoy effect"": introducing an irrelevant option (a decoy) can influence choices among other (relevant) options. Exactly how and why decoys trigger this effect is not known. It may be an example of fast heuristic decision-making, which is adaptive in natural environments, but may lead to biased choices in certain markets or experiments. We used fMRI and transcranial magnetic stimulation to investigate the neural underpinning of the decoy effect of both sexes. The left ventral striatum was more active when the chosen option dominated the decoy. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the presence of a decoy option influences the valuation of other options, making valuation context-dependent even when choices appear fully rational. Consistent with the idea that control is recruited to prevent heuristics from producing biased choices, the right inferior frontal gyrus, often implicated in inhibiting prepotent responses, connected more strongly with the striatum when subjects successfully overrode the decoy effect and made unbiased choices. This is further supported by our transcranial magnetic stimulation experiment: subjects whose right inferior frontal gyrus was temporarily disrupted made biased choices more often than a control group. Our results suggest that the neural basis of the decoy effect could be the context-dependent activation of the valuation area. But the differential connectivity from the frontal area may indicate how deliberate control monitors and corrects errors and biases in decision-making. ",

Using a crossover design, 15 healthy women were scanned using fMRI while presented with low- and high-energy pictures of food, once in the morning (6:30-8:30 am) and once in the evening (5:00-7:00 pm). Diets were identical on both days of the fMRI scans and were verified using weighed food records. Visual analog scales were used to record subjective perception of hunger and preoccupation with food prior to each fMRI scan. Six areas of the brain showed lower activation in the evening to both high- and low-energy foods, including structures in reward pathways (P < 0.05). Nine brain regions showed significantly higher activation for high-energy foods compared to low-energy foods (P < 0.05). High-energy food stimuli tended to produce greater fMRI responses than low-energy food stimuli in specific areas of the brain, regardless of time of day. However, evening scans showed a lower response to both low- and high-energy food pictures in some areas of the brain. Subjectively, participants reported no difference in hunger by time of day (F = 1.84, P = 0.19), but reported they could eat more (F = 4.83, P = 0.04) and were more preoccupied with thoughts of food (F = 5.51, P = 0.03) in the evening compared to the morning. These data underscore the role that time of day may have on neural responses to food stimuli. These results may also have clinical implications for fMRI measurement in order to prevent a time of day bias. ",
pmid_21546858,Placebo effects on analgesia related to testosterone and premotor activation.,,"Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we tested whether graded placebo conditions could modulate the degree of placebo effect and brain activation patterns in study participants and whether the placebo effect could be influenced by hormones. Each participant was investigated under three conditions: the control (no placebo) condition, the low-placebo condition, and the high-placebo condition (HPC). Activations of the premotor areas, anterior cingulate cortex, and prefrontal cortex were stronger in the HPC compared with those in the control and low placebo conditions. The premotor areas were activated by increased testosterone levels under the HPC. These results suggest that testosterone may affect the brain activation and response to pain during a high-placebo response, with the data supported by brain imaging. ",

A pertinent question is whether these patients are also capable of logical thought. Here, we validate an fMRI paradigm that can detect the neural fingerprint of reasoning processes and moreover, can confirm whether a participant derives logical answers. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach in a physically non-communicative patient who had been shown to engage in mental imagery in response to simple auditory instructions. Our results demonstrate that this individual retains a remarkable capacity for higher cognition, engaging in the reasoning task and deducing logical answers. We suggest that this approach is suitable for detecting residual reasoning ability using neural responses and could readily be adapted to assess other aspects of cognition. ",

Because ECT is also relatively fast-acting, longitudinal study of its neurobiological effects offers critical insight into the mechanisms underlying depression and antidepressant response. Here we assessed modulation of intrinsic brain activity in corticolimbic networks associated with ECT and clinical response. We measured resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) in patients with treatment-resistant depression (n=30), using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) acquired before and after completing a treatment series with right-unilateral ECT. Using independent component analysis, we assessed changes in RSFC with 1) symptom improvement and 2) ECT regardless of treatment outcome in patients, with reference to healthy controls (n=33, also scanned twice). After ECT, consistent changes in RSFC within targeted depression-relevant functional networks were observed in the dorsal anterior cingulate (ACC), mediodorsal thalamus (mdTh), hippocampus, and right anterior temporal, medial parietal, and posterior cingulate cortex in all patients. In a separate analysis, changes in depressive symptoms were associated with RSFC changes in the dorsal ACC, mdTh, putamen, medial prefrontal, and lateral parietal cortex. RSFC of these regions did not change in healthy controls. Neuroplasticity underlying clinical change was in part separable from changes associated with the effects of ECT observed in all patients. However, both ECT and clinical change were associated with RSFC modulation in dorsal ACC, mdTh and hippocampus, which may indicate that these regions underlie the mechanisms of clinical outcome in ECT and may be effective targets for future neurostimulation therapies.

pmid_19887505,The psychophysics of visual motion and global form processing in autism.,,"Several groups have recently reported that people with autism may suffer from a deficit in visual motion processing and proposed that these deficits may be related to a general dorsal stream dysfunction. In order to test the dorsal stream deficit hypothesis, we investigated coherent and biological motion perception as well as coherent form perception in a group of adolescents with autism and a group of age-matched typically developing controls. If the dorsal stream hypothesis were true, we would expect to document deficits in both coherent and biological motion processing in this group but find no deficit in coherent form perception. Using the method of constant stimuli and standard psychophysical analysis techniques, we measured thresholds for coherent motion, biological motion and coherent form. We found that adolescents with autism showed reduced sensitivity to both coherent and biological motion but performed as well as age-matched controls during coherent form perception. Correlations between intelligence quotient and task performance, however, appear to drive much of the group difference in coherent motion perception. Differences between groups on coherent motion perception did not remain significant when intelligence quotient was controlled for, but group differences in biological motion perception were more robust, remaining significant even when intelligence quotient differences were accounted for. Additionally, aspects of task performance on the biological motion perception task were related to autism symptomatology. These results do not support a general dorsal stream dysfunction in adolescents with autism but provide evidence of a more complex impairment in higher-level dynamic attentional processes. ",

Recently, it has also been shown that weight loss interventions might affect fMRI food cue reactivity and that there is a close association between the alteration of cue reactivity and the outcome of the intervention. Here we tested whether fMRI food cue reactivity could be used as a marker of diet-induced early changes of neural processing in the striatum that are predictive of the outcome of the weight loss intervention. To this end we investigated the relationship between food cue reactivity in the striatum measured one month after the onset of the weight loss program and weight changes obtained at the end of the six-month intervention. We observed a significant correlation between BMI change measured after six months and early alterations of fMRI food cue reactivity in the striatum, including the bilateral putamen, right pallidum, and left caudate. Our findings provide evidence for diet-induced early alterations of fMRI food cue reactivity in the striatum that can predict the outcome of the weight loss intervention. ",

Previous studies in human cannabis users reported elevated trait impulsivity and neural cue reactivity in striatal circuits; however, these studies were not able to separate addiction-related from exposure-related adaptations. To differentiate the adaptive changes, the current functional magnetic resonance imaging study examined behavioral and neural cue reactivity in dependent (n = 18) and nondependent (n = 20) heavy cannabis users and a nonusing reference group (n = 44). Irrespective of dependence status, cannabis users demonstrated elevated trait impulsivity as well as increased ventral striatal reactivity and striatal frontal coupling in response to drug cues. Dependent users selectively exhibited dorsal striatal reactivity and decreased striatal limbic coupling during cue exposure. An exploratory analysis revealed that higher ventral caudate neural cue reactivity was associated with stronger cue-induced arousal and craving in dependent users, whereas this pattern was reversed in nondependent users. Taken together, the current findings suggest that exaggerated responses of the ventral striatal reward system may promote excessive drug use in humans, whereas adaptations in dorsal striatal systems engaged in habit formation may promote the transition to addictive use.

pmid_21791248,Social exclusion and punishment of excluders: neural correlates and developmental trajectories.,,"Social exclusion is a distressing experience and can result in a reduction of prosocial behavior. In this fMRI study we examined the neural networks involved in social exclusion and subsequent fairness considerations across adolescent development. Participants from 3 age groups (10-12, 14-16 and 19-21 year olds) participated in the study and performed two tasks; first, participants played Cyberball to induce feelings of social inclusion and exclusion, followed by a Dictator game in which participants were asked to divide coins between themselves and the players who previously included or excluded them. Results revealed a network of regions associated with social exclusion, which involve the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)/ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), subgenual ACC and the lateral PFC, as well as the insula and the dorsal ACC. Although social exclusion generated strong distress for all age groups, 10-12 year olds showed increased activity in the subgenual ACC in the exclusion game, which has been associated in previous studies with negative affective processing. Results of the Dictator game revealed that all age groups selectively punished the excluders by making lower offers. These offers were associated with activation in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), superior temporal sulcus (STS) and the lateral PFC. Age comparisons revealed that adults showed additional activity in the insula and dorsal ACC when making offers to the excluders. The results are discussed in the light of recent findings on neural networks involved in social exclusion and the development of social brain regions. ",

Children (8-12 years old) of parents with bipolar I disorder (AR children, n = 21) and of parents without any DSM-IV Axis I disorder (healthy controls, n = 24) were evaluated using diagnostic assessments and brain magnetic resonance imaging. Morphometric analyses were used to examine group differences in the prefrontal cortical, thalamic, striatal, and amygdalar volumes. Nine (43%) of the AR children met DSM-IV-TR criteria for a nonbipolar mood disorder at the time of assessment. AR and healthy control children did not demonstrate statistically significant differences across regions of interest (Wilks lambda =.86, F4,39 = 1.64, p = .18; effect size, f = 0.19). Post hoc analyses of covariance showed the largest relative effect size was contributed by the prefrontal cortex (f = 0.26). Eight- to 12-year-old children with a familial risk for mania do not exhibit any statistically significant volumetric differences in the prefrontal cortex, thalamus, striatum, or amygdala as compared with age-matched children of parents without any psychopathology. Longitudinal studies examining whether structural changes over time may be associated with vulnerability for developing subsequent bipolar disorder are needed to clarify the underlying pathophysiology of this disorder.

pmid_23578759,Allured or alarmed: counteractive control responses to food temptations in the brain.,,"Typically, it is believed that palatable, high caloric foods signal reward and trigger indulgent responses. However, Counteractive Control Theory suggests that, to the extent that people are concerned about their weight, a confrontation with palatable foods should also trigger 'alarm bell responses' which promote successful self-control. Our study is the first to investigate such counteractive control processes in the brain employing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a sample of successful self-regulators. Indeed, besides the traditional finding that foods elicit heightened attention as witnessed by greater activation of primary visual cortex, we found that viewing palatable foods elicited brain activation in areas associated with self-regulation. Crucially, brain activation in self-regulation areas was related to diet importance. Thus, our results are the first to show that food cues not only evoke hedonic brain responses; in successful self-regulators they also trigger alarm bell responses, which may reflect the neural processes underlying successful self-control.

pmid_16197684,Naming the same entities from visual or from auditory stimulation engages similar regions of left inferotemporal cortices.,,"We have proposed that the left inferotemporal (IT) region contains structures that mediate between conceptual knowledge retrieval and word-form retrieval, and we have hypothesized that these structures are utilized for word retrieval irrespective of the sensory modality through which an entity is apprehended, thus being ""modality neutral."" We tested this idea in two sensory modalities, visual and auditory, and for two categories of concrete entities, tools and animals. In a PET experiment, 10 normal participants named tools and animals either from pictures or from characteristic sounds (e.g., ""scissors"" from a picture of a scissors or from the sound of a scissors cutting; ""rooster"" from a picture of a rooster or from the sound of a rooster crowing). Visual and auditory naming of tools activated the left posterior/lateral IT; visual and auditory naming of animals activated the left anterior/ventral IT. For both tools and animals, the left IT activations were similar in location and magnitude regardless of whether participants were naming entities from pictures or from sounds. The results provide novel evidence to support the notion that left IT structures contain ""modality-neutral"" systems for mediating between conceptual knowledge and word retrieval. ",
pmid_19175815,Reduced activation in lateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate during attention and cognitive control functions in medication-naïve adolescents with depression compared to controls.,,"There is increasing recognition of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adolescence. In adult MDD, abnormalities of fronto-striatal and fronto-cingulate circuitries mediating cognitive control functions have been implicated in the pathogenesis and been related to problems with controlling negative thoughts. No neuroimaging studies of cognitive control functions, however, exist in paediatric depression. This study investigated whether medication-naïve adolescents with MDD show abnormal brain activation of fronto-striatal and fronto-cingulate networks when performing tasks of attentional and cognitive control. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to compare brain activation between 21 medication-naïve adolescents with a first-episode of MDD aged 14-17 years and 21 healthy adolescents, matched for handedness, age, sex, demographics and IQ. Activation paradigms were tasks of selective attention (Simon task), attentional switching (Switch task), and motor response inhibition and error detection (Stop task). In all three tasks, adolescents with depression compared to healthy controls demonstrated reduced activation in task-relevant right dorsolateral (DLPFC), inferior prefrontal cortex (IFC) and anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG). Additional areas of relatively reduced activation were in the parietal lobes during the Stop and Switch tasks, putamen, insula and temporal lobes during the Switch task and precuneus during the Simon task. This study shows first evidence that medication-naïve adolescents with MDD are characterised by abnormal function in ACG and right lateral prefrontal cortex during tasks of attention and performance monitoring, suggesting an early pathogenesis of these functional abnormalities attributed to MDD.

Amygdala dysfunction impacts valence evaluation/response selection and emotion attention in youth with DBDs, particularly in those with elevated callous-unemotional (CU) traits. However, amygdala responsiveness during social cognition and the responsiveness of the acute threat circuitry (amygdala/periaqueductal gray) in youth with DBDs have been less well-examined, particularly with reference to CU traits. 31 youth with DBDs and 27 typically developing youth (IQ, age and gender-matched) completed a threat paradigm during fMRI where animate and inanimate, threatening and neutral stimuli appeared to loom towards or recede from participants. Reduced responsiveness to threat variables, including visual threats and encroaching stimuli, was observed within acute threat circuitry and temporal, lateral frontal and parietal cortices in youth with DBDs. This reduced responsiveness, at least with respect to the looming variable, was modulated by CU traits. Reduced responsiveness to animacy information was also observed within temporal, lateral frontal and parietal cortices, but not within amygdala. Reduced responsiveness to animacy information as a function of CU traits was observed in PCC, though not within the amygdala. Reduced threat responsiveness may contribute to risk taking and impulsivity in youth with DBDs, particularly those with high levels of CU traits. Future work will need to examine the degree to which this reduced response to animacy is independent of amygdala dysfunction in youth with DBDs and what role PCC might play in the dysfunctional social cognition observed in youth with high levels of CU traits.

All subjects underwent an fMRI task of passive listening of narratives played forward and backward, alternated with periods of silence. This study analysed cerebral response to language and to complex sound processing in the healthy subjects' group and in each patient, using SPM5. One patient in VS and one in MCS showed cerebral responses to language and to complex sound very similar to those shown by the healthy volunteers. Two more patients, one in VS and one in MCS, showed significant responses to complex sound only. Finally, one patient in VS and one patient in MCS failed to show significant activation in response to either stimulus. Some patients in VS and MCS can preserve cerebral responses to language and auditory stimuli. fMRI may be useful to identify these responses, which may pass unnoticed in a bedside examination. ",

However, MDD-related alterations in functional interaction between the cerebral hemispheres are still not well understood. Resting state fMRI, which reveals spontaneous neural fluctuations in blood oxygen level dependent signals, provides a means to detect interhemispheric functional coherence. We examined the resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the two hemispheres and its relationships with clinical characteristics in MDD patients using a recently proposed measurement named ""voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC)"". We compared the interhemispheric RSFC, computed using the VMHC approach, of seventeen first-episode drug-naive patients with MDD and seventeen healthy controls. Compared to the controls, MDD patients showed significant VMHC decreases in the medial orbitofrontal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and occipital regions including the middle occipital gyrus and cuneus. In MDD patients, a negative correlation was found between VMHC of the fusiform gyrus and illness duration. Moreover, there were several regions whose VMHC showed significant negative correlations with the severity of cognitive disturbance, including the prefrontal regions, such as middle and inferior frontal gyri, and two regions in the cereballar crus. These findings suggest that the functional coordination between homotopic brain regions is impaired in MDD patients, thereby providing new evidence supporting the interhemispheric connectivity deficits of MDD. The significant correlations between the VMHC and clinical characteristics in MDD patients suggest potential clinical implication of VMHC measures for MDD. Interhemispheric RSFC may serve as a useful screening method for evaluating MDD where neural connectivity is implicated in the pathophysiology. ",

perception","The visuo-motor channel hypothesis (Jeannerod, 1981) postulates that grasping movements consist of a grip and a transport component differing in their reliance on intrinsic vs. extrinsic object properties (e.g. size vs. location, respectively). While recent neuroimaging studies have revealed separate brain areas implicated in grip and transport components within the parietal lobe, less is known about the neural processing of extrinsic and intrinsic properties of objects for grasping actions. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation to examine the cortical areas involved in processing object size, object location or both. Participants grasped (using the dominant right hand) or passively viewed sequential pairs of objects that could differ in size, location or both. We hypothesized that if intrinsic and extrinsic object properties are processed separately, as suggested by the visuo-motor channel hypothesis, we would observe adaptation to object size in areas that code the grip and adaptation to location in areas that code the transport component. On the other hand, if intrinsic and extrinsic object properties are not processed separately, brain areas involved in grasping may show adaptation to both object size and location. We found adaptation to object size for grasping movements in the left anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS), in agreement with the idea that object size is processed separately from location. In addition, the left superior parietal occipital sulcus (SPOC), primary somatosensory and motor area (S1/M1), precuneus, dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), and supplementary motor area (SMA) showed non-additive adaptation to both object size and location. We propose different roles for the aIPS as compared with the SPOC, S1/M1, precuneus, PMd and SMA. In particular, while the aIPS codes intrinsic object properties, which are relevant for hand preshaping and force scaling, area SPOC, S1/M1, precuneus, PMd and SMA code intrinsic as well as extrinsic object properties, both of which are relevant for digit positioning during grasping.

During risk-taking and as compared to HCs, IGD subjects selected more risk-disadvantageous trials and demonstrated less activation of the anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate and middle temporal gyrus. During risky decision-making and as compared to HCs, IGD subjects showed shorter response times and less activations of the inferior frontal and superior temporal gyri. Taken together, data suggest that IGD subjects show impaired executive control in selecting risk-disadvantageous choices, and they make risky decisions more hastily and with less recruitment of regions implicated in impulse control. These results suggest a possible neurobiological underpinning for why IGD subjects may exhibit poor control over their game-seeking behaviors even when encountering negative consequences and provide possible therapeutic targets for interventions in this population.

pmid_25047745,Oxytocin attenuates neural reactivity to masked threat cues from the eyes.,,"The neuropeptide oxytocin has recently been shown to modulate covert attention shifts to emotional face cues and to improve discrimination of masked facial emotions. These results suggest that oxytocin modulates facial emotion processing at early perceptual stages prior to full evaluation of the emotional expression. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine whether oxytocin alters neural responses to backwardly masked angry and happy faces while controlling for attention to the eye vs the mouth region. Intranasal oxytocin administration reduced amygdala reactivity to masked emotions when attending to salient facial features, ie, the eyes of angry faces and the mouth of happy faces. In addition, oxytocin decreased neural responses within the fusiform gyrus and brain stem areas, as well as functional coupling between the amygdala and the fusiform gyrus specifically for threat cues from the eyes. Effects of oxytocin on brain activity were not attributable to differences in behavioral performance, as oxytocin had no impact on mere emotion detection. Our results suggest that oxytocin attenuates neural correlates of early arousal by threat signals from the eye region. As reduced threat sensitivity may increase the likelihood of engaging in social interactions, our findings may have important implications for clinical states of social anxiety. ",

However, the effects of aging on musical semantic memory remain unexamined. We compared activation associated with recognition of familiar melodies in younger and older adults. Recognition follows successful retrieval from the musical lexicon that comprises a lifetime of learned musical phrases. We used the sparse-sampling technique in fMRI to determine the neural correlates of melody recognition by comparing activation when listening to familiar vs. unfamiliar melodies, and to identify age differences. Recognition-related cortical activation was detected in the right superior temporal, bilateral inferior and superior frontal, left middle orbitofrontal, bilateral precentral, and left supramarginal gyri. Region-of-interest analysis showed greater activation for younger adults in the left superior temporal gyrus and for older adults in the left superior frontal, left angular, and bilateral superior parietal regions. Our study provides powerful evidence for these musical memory networks due to a large sample (N = 40) that includes older adults. This study is the first to investigate the neural basis of melody recognition in older adults and to compare the findings to younger adults. ",
pmid_20035018,An fMRI investigation of the cultural specificity of music memory.,,"This study explored the role of culture in shaping music perception and memory. We tested the hypothesis that listeners demonstrate different patterns of activation associated with music processing-particularly right frontal cortex-when encoding and retrieving culturally familiar and unfamiliar stimuli, with the latter evoking broader activation consistent with more complex memory tasks. Subjects (n = 16) were right-handed adults born and raised in the USA (n = 8) or Turkey (n = 8) with minimal music training. Using fMRI procedures, we scanned subjects during two tasks: (i) listening to novel musical examples from their own culture and an unfamiliar culture and (ii) identifying which among a series of brief excerpts were taken from the longer examples. Both groups were more successful remembering music of their home culture. We found greater activation for culturally unfamiliar music listening in the left cerebellar region, right angular gyrus, posterior precuneus and right middle frontal area extending into the inferior frontal cortex. Subjects demonstrated greater activation in the cingulate gyrus and right lingual gyrus when engaged in recall of culturally unfamiliar music. This study provides evidence for the influence of culture on music perception and memory performance at both a behavioral and neurological level. ",

Although it has been shown that the orbitofrontal cortex is hypo-metabolic and exhibits less gray matter in these patients the functional role of this finding is still unclear as virtually no functional imaging studies exploring withdrawal of medication have been published. We compared structural and functional magnetic resonance images of 18 patients before and after drug withdrawal with age and gender matched controls using a well-established trigeminal, nociceptive fMRI paradigm. We reproduced structural changes in the orbitofrontal cortex of the patients which highly correlated with the clinical outcome of medication withdrawal. The neuronal activity before drug withdrawal in pain related regions (operculum, insula, spinal trigeminal nucleus) was reduced compared to after drug withdrawal and the orbitofrontal cortex showed a reduced functional connectivity to the nociceptive input region (spinal trigeminal nucleus) and the cerebellum which regained after withdrawal. These data suggest the seminal role of the orbitofrontal cortex as a mediator between bottom-up and top-down stream in headache processing. ",

The possibility of region-specific insular volumetric reduction as an endophenotype and/or a possible treatment predictor is a critical issue with great implications for the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease. The sample of the current study comprised 44 drug-naive and first-episode patients, 42 unaffected siblings, and 44 healthy controls. A computational anatomy toolbox (CAT12) was applied to analyze the structural images with a fine-grained, cross-validated brainnetome atlas. Correlation analysis and support vector regression (SVR) were used to determine the relationship between insular deficits and symptomatic severity among patients. The gray matter volume (GMV) values in the left hypergranular insula (G) exhibited the following pattern: patients < siblings < controls. GMV values in the right ventral agranular insula (vIa) and baseline Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale negative symptoms subscale scores among patients showed a positive correlation (r = 0.384, p = .010). Further SVR analysis exhibited a significantly positive correlation between GMV values in the right vIa and negative symptomatic improvement among patients (r = 0.537, p < .001). Results suggested the presence of region-specific insular volumetric decreases in first-episode schizophrenia. Thus, volumetric decrease in left G might be a potential endophenotype for schizophrenia, and GMV values in right vIa might be used to predict negative symptomatic improvement in schizophrenia. ",
pmid_26045346,Neural substrates of cognitive flexibility in cocaine and gambling addictions.,,"Individuals with cocaine and gambling addictions exhibit cognitive flexibility deficits that may underlie persistence of harmful behaviours. We investigated the neural substrates of cognitive inflexibility in cocaine users v. pathological gamblers, aiming to disambiguate common mechanisms v. cocaine effects. Eighteen cocaine users, 18 pathological gamblers and 18 controls performed a probabilistic reversal learning task during functional magnetic resonance imaging, and were genotyped for the DRD2/ANKK Taq1A polymorphism. Cocaine users and pathological gamblers exhibited reduced ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) signal during reversal shifting. Cocaine users further showed increased dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) activation relative to pathological gamblers during perseveration, and decreased dorsolateral PFC activation relative to pathological gamblers and controls during shifting. Preliminary genetic findings indicated that cocaine users carrying the DRD2/ANKK Taq1A1+ genotype may derive unique stimulatory effects on shifting-related ventrolateral PFC signal. Reduced ventrolateral PFC activation during shifting may constitute a common neural marker across gambling and cocaine addictions. Additional cocaine-related effects relate to a wider pattern of task-related dysregulation, reflected in signal abnormalities in dorsolateral and dmPFC. ",
pmid_22809025,Commonality and specificity of acupuncture action at three acupoints as evidenced by FMRI.,,"Previous work from our team and others has shown that manual acupuncture at LI4 (hegu), ST36 (zusanli), and LV3 (taichong) deactivates a limbic-paralimbic-neocortical brain network, and at the same time activates somatosensory regions of the brain. The objective of the present study was to explore the specificity and commonality of the brain response to manual acupuncture at LI4, ST36, and LV3, acupoints that are located on different meridians and are used to treat pain disorders. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to monitor the brain responses to acupuncture at three different acupoints; we examined 46 healthy subjects who, according to their psychophysical responses, experienced deqi sensation during acupuncture. Brain responses to stimulation at each of the acupoints were displayed in conjunction with one another to show the spatial distribution. We found clusters of deactivation in the medial prefrontal, medial parietal and medial temporal lobes showing significant convergence of two or all three of the acupoints. The largest regions showing common responses to all three acupoints were the right subgenual BA25, right subgenual cingulate, right isthmus of the cingulum bundle, and right BA31. We also noted differences in major sections of the medial prefrontal and medial temporal lobes, with LI4 predominating in the pregenual cingulate and hippocampal formation, ST36 predominating in the subgenual cingulate, and LV3 predominating in the posterior hippocampus and posterior cingulate. The results suggest that although these acupoints are commonly used for anti-pain and modulatory effects, they may mobilize the same intrinsic global networks, with substantial overlap of common brain regions to mediate their actions. Our findings showing preferential response of certain limbic-paralimbic structures suggests acupoints may also exhibit relative specificity. ",
pmid_30566491,Is individualism-collectivism associated with self-control? Evidence from Chinese and U.S. samples.,,"Self-control plays an important role in human's daily life. In the recent two decades, scholars have exerted tremendous effort to examine the etiologies of the individual differences in self-control. Among numerous predictors of self-control, the role of culture has been relatively overlooked. In this study, the influences of cultural orientation on self-control were examined based on the collectivism-individualism framework using both self-report and behavioral task to assess self-control. A convenience sample of 542 Chinese and 446 U.S. undergraduates participated in the research. They were invited to fill out self-report questionnaires reporting their levels of attitudinal self-control and individualistic-collectivistic orientation after completing a computer-based Stroop task. Results of hierarchical regression models showed that Chinese participants reported less attitudinal self-control but had higher behavioral self-control than their U.S. counterparts. Moreover, individual-level individualism and collectivism was negatively and positively related to attitudinal self-control in both countries, respectively. Individual-level collectivism was significantly related to better behavioral self-control, but no significant results were found for the relationship between individual-level individualism and behavioral self-control. In sum, individualism and collectivism have some influences on individual differences in self-control. Implications for future research were discussed. ",
pmid_22892351,Impaired inhibitory control in 'internet addiction disorder': a functional magnetic resonance imaging study.,,'Internet addiction disorder' (IAD) is rapidly becoming a prevalent mental health concern in many countries around the world. The neurobiological underpinnings of internet addiction should be studied to unravel the potential heterogeneity in the disorder. The present study examines the neural correlates of response inhibition in males with and without IAD using an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) Stroop task. The IAD group demonstrated significantly greater 'Stroop effect'-related activity in the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices compared with their healthy peers. These results may suggest diminished efficiency of response-inhibition processes in the IAD group relative to healthy controls. ,
pmid_16854440,Differential activation of ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during working memory retrieval.,,"Brain imaging studies have suggested a predominant involvement of prefrontal areas during retrieval of information from working memory (WM). This study used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the gradual recruitment of brain areas during verbal WM-retrieval with a parametrically varied modified version of the Sternberg Item Recognition Paradigm. In particular, we were interested in activation differences during retrieval of negative and positive probes. Fifteen subjects performed a WM-task which required the retrieval of a probe letter from a set of a maximum of three letters. The analysis of the retrieval period regardless of probe type revealed bilateral VLPFC activation during retrieval from a single remembered item. These initially activated regions showed a gradual activation increase of left VLPFC (BA 47) and anterior PFC (BA 10) as well as and bilateral DLPFC (BA 9) with increasing retrieval demand, i.e. during retrieval of two and three previously remembered letters. The comparison of negative and positive probes (non-targets versus targets) revealed greater activity in VLPFC (BA 47) in response to negative than to positive probes. These findings demonstrate that ventral areas of prefrontal cortex seem to be differentially engaged during the discrimination of a non-target from a previously manipulated set. ",

MicroRNAs, which participate in regulating gene expression, potentially influence neurodevelopment. This study aimed to explore whether differential GM volume is associated with differential miRNA levels in ADHD patients. We recruited a total of 30 drug-naïve patients with ADHD (mean age 10.6 years) and 25 healthy controls (mean age 10.6 years) that underwent a single session of 3.0-T whole brain structural MRI scanning. RNA samples from the participants' white blood cells were collected to identify the ΔCt values of three miRNAs (miR-30e-5p, miR-126-5p, and miR-140-3p) using the real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In comparison to the control group, ADHD patients demonstrated a significantly lower GM volume in the cingulate gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, right middle occipital gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, and significantly higher ΔCt values of miR-30e-5p, miR-126-5p, and miR-140-3p. In the ADHD group, the GM volume of cingulate gyrus and left fusiform gyrus was negatively correlated with the ΔCt values of miR-30e-5p, miR-140-3p. The GM volume of left fusiform gyrus was negatively correlated to ADHD behavioral symptoms. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we observed that the effect of miR-140-3p on hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms was mediated by left fusiform gyrus. Our findings support that GM volume reduction and miRNA increases may be biomarkers for ADHD in children and adolescents. Expression levels of miRNAs may affect the development of brain structures and further participate in the pathophysiology of ADHD. ",

fMRI","Bipolar depression (BD) is easily misdiagnosed as unipolar depression (UD) or major depressive disorder (MDD) because the depressive symptoms can overlap. Regional homogeneity (ReHo), a measure commonly used for analyzing resting-state fMRI data, has been applied to the study of various neuropsychiatric disorders. However, to date, studies directly comparing BD and UD using ReHo have been relatively scarce. Further investigation is needed to study the latent pathophysiological mechanisms of BD and UD. Fifty-five patients with BD and 76 patients with UD, as well as 113 healthy controls (HC), underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We compared the voxel-wise ReHo across the whole brain for subjects in each of the three groups. Significant differences were found in the left frontal cluster (LFC) across the three groups. There were differences between BD and UD in the LFC and left temporal cluster (LTC). In addition, differences between UD and HC existed in the LFC and the occipital cluster (OC). When comparing BD subjects with HC subjects, significant differences were found in all three clusters. No correlations were observed between the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) scores or sub-scores and the ReHo values of BD or UD patients. ReHo values in the LFC differed significantly among BD, UD, and HC subjects. ReHo in the LTC showed significant differences between BD and UD that might serve as neuroimaging markers of BD. Further, BD and UD shared ReHo changes in the cuneus, suggesting that the cuneus might provide a depressive state neuroimaging marker of BD and UD patients. ",

temporal pole","Third-party punishment (TPP) for norm violations is an essential deterrent in large-scale human societies, and builds on two essential cognitive functions: evaluating legal responsibility and determining appropriate punishment. Despite converging evidence that TPP is mediated by a specific set of brain regions, little is known about their effective connectivity (direction and strength of connections). Applying parametric event-related functional MRI in conjunction with multivariate Granger causality analysis, we asked healthy participants to estimate how much punishment a hypothetical perpetrator deserves for intentionally committing criminal offenses varying in levels of harm. Our results confirmed that TPP legal decisions are based on two domain-general networks: the mentalizing network for evaluating legal responsibility and the central-executive network for determining appropriate punishment. Further, temporal pole (TP) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC) emerged as hubs of the mentalizing network, uniquely generating converging output connections to ventromedial PFC, temporo-parietal junction, and posterior cingulate. In particular, dorsomedial PFC received inputs only from TP and both its activation and its connectivity to dorsolateral PFC correlated with degree of punishment. This supports the hypothesis that dorsomedial PFC acts as the driver of the TPP activation pattern, leading to the decision on the appropriate punishment. In conclusion, these results advance our understanding of the organizational elements of the TPP brain networks and provide better insights into the mental states of judges and jurors tasked with blaming and punishing legal wrongs.

Voxel-based morphometry","Heightened body awareness (BA) is conducive for increasing understanding of bodily state and improves individuals' health and well-being. Although there has been cumulative research concentrating on the self-perceived tendency to focus on negatively valenced interoceptive sensations, the specific structural and functional neural patterns underlying BA and their role in the relationship between BA and individual well-being remain unclear. Voxel-based morphometry and whole brain functional connectivity analyses were conducted to examine the structural and functional neural patterns, respectively, in 686 healthy subjects. BA and subjective well-being were assessed using questionnaires. BA was inversely related to gray matter volume of the right inferior frontal gyrus, opercular part (IFGoperc). Higher BA was correlated with enhanced IFGoperc-precuneus and IFGoperc-anterior supramarginal gyrus connectivities, and with decreased IFGoperc-lateral occipital cortex and IFGoperc-medial frontal cortex connectivities. The inferior frontal gyrus, triangular part (in the fronto-parietal task control network) acted as the hub that linked the sensory/somatomotor network, the default mode network, and the dorsal and ventral attention network. The IFGoperc-precuneus connectivity moderated the association between BA and subjective well-being. We were unable to rank all the networks by their relative importance, because the absolute weighted value in each module was not calculated. Our findings demonstrated that BA was reflected by specific neural patterns mainly involved in cognitive-affective control, attentional and self-referential processing, as well as multisensory integration, which could offer some references for current therapies (e.g., mindfulness, yoga training) that are dedicated to solving health problems and improving individual well-being.

pmid_21926423,Hyporeactivity of ventral striatum towards incentive stimuli in unmedicated depressed patients normalizes after treatment with escitalopram.,,"Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) involves deficits in the reward system. While neuroimaging studies have focused on affective stimulus processing, few investigations have directly addressed deficits in the anticipation of incentives. We examined neural responses during gain and loss anticipation in patients with MDD before and after treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Fifteen adults with MDD and 15 healthy participants, matched for age, verbal IQ and smoking habits, were investigated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study using a monetary incentive delay task. Patients were scanned drug-free and after 6 weeks of open-label treatment with escitalopram; controls were scanned twice at corresponding time points. We compared the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response during the anticipation of gain and loss with a neutral condition. A repeated measures ANOVA was calculated to identify effects of group (MDD vs. controls), time (first vs. second scan) and group-by-time interaction. Severity of depression was measured with the Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression and the Beck Depression Inventory. MDD patients showed significantly less ventral striatal activation during anticipation of gain and loss compared with controls before, but not after, treatment. There was a significant group-by-time interaction during anticipation of loss in the left ventral striatum due to a signal increase in patients after treatment. Ventral striatal hyporesponsiveness was associated with the severity of depression and in particular anhedonic symptoms. These findings suggest that MDD patients show ventral striatal hyporesponsiveness during incentive cue processing, which normalizes after successful treatment. ",
pmid_19702460,Neural mechanisms of verb argument structure processing in agrammatic aphasic and healthy age-matched listeners.,,"Processing of lexical verbs involves automatic access to argument structure entries entailed within the verb's representation. Recent neuroimaging studies with young normal listeners suggest that this involves bilateral posterior peri-sylvian tissue, with graded activation in these regions on the basis of argument structure complexity. The aim of the present study was to examine the neural mechanisms of verb processing using fMRI in older normal volunteers and patients with stroke-induced agrammatic aphasia, a syndrome in which verb, as compared to noun, production often is selectively impaired, but verb comprehension in both on-line and off-line tasks is spared. Fourteen healthy listeners and five age-matched aphasic patients performed a lexical decision task, which examined verb processing by argument structure complexity, namely, one-argument [i.e., intransitive (v1)], two-argument [i.e., transitive (v2)], and three-argument (v3) verbs. Results for the age-matched listeners largely replicated those for younger participants studied by Thompson et al. [Thompson, C. K., Bonakdarpour, B., Fix, S. C., Blumenfeld, H. K., Parrish, T. B., Gitelman, D. R., et al. Neural correlates of verb argument structure processing. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 19, 1753-1767, 2007]: v3 - v1 comparisons showed activation of the angular gyrus in both hemispheres and this same heteromodal region was activated in the left hemisphere in the (v2 + v3) - v1 contrast. Similar results were derived for the agrammatic aphasic patients, however, activation was unilateral (in the right hemisphere for three participants) rather than bilateral, likely because these patients' lesions extended to the left temporo-parietal region. All performed the task with high accuracy and, despite differences in lesion site and extent, they recruited spared tissue in the same regions as healthy subjects. Consistent with psycholinguistic models of sentence processing, these findings indicate that the posterior language network is engaged for processing verb argument structure and is crucial for semantic integration of argument structure information.

These studies, however, confounded monetary value and the number used to represent it, which leads to the possibility that some elements in the network may be specialized for processing numeric rather than monetary value. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated numeric magnitude and units to construct a range of economic rewards for simple decisions (e.g., 1¢, $1, 100¢, $100). Consistent with previous research in numerical cognition, results showed that blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity in intraparietal sulcus was correlated with changes in numeric magnitude, independent of monetary value, whereas activity in orbitofrontal cortex was correlated with monetary value, independent of numeric magnitude. Finally, region-of-interest analyses revealed that the BOLD response to numeric magnitude, but not monetary value, described a compressive function. Together, these findings highlight the importance of numerical cognition for understanding how the brain processes monetary rewards. ",

Previously, imaging studies have investigated neural correlates of facial motion primarily using abstract motion stimuli. Here, we studied how the brain processes natural non-rigid facial motion in direct comparison to static stimuli and matched phase-scrambled controls. As predicted from previous studies, dynamic faces elicit higher responses than static faces in lateral temporal areas corresponding to hMT+/V5 and STS. Interestingly, individually defined, static-face-sensitive regions in bilateral fusiform gyrus and left inferior occipital gyrus also respond more to dynamic than static faces. These results suggest integration of form and motion information during the processing of dynamic faces even in ventral temporal and inferior lateral occipital areas. In addition, our results show that dynamic stimuli are a robust tool to localize areas related to the processing of static and dynamic face information. ",

However, to date, there is no consensus on the extent to which those factors are correlated with MPA among college students. We thus performed a meta-analysis to quantitatively synthesize the previous findings. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted by searching PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Wanfang, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), and Chinese Biological Medicine (CBM) databases from inception to August 1, 2020. Pooled Pearson's correlation coefficients between MPA and anxiety, depression, impulsivity, and sleep quality were calculated by R software using random effects model. Forty studies involving a total of 33, 650 college students were identified. Weak-to-moderate positive correlations were found between MPA and anxiety, depression, impulsivity and sleep quality (anxiety: summary r = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.34-0.45, P < 0.001, I2 = 84.9%; depression: summary r = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.32-0.40, P < 0.001, I2 = 84.2%; impulsivity: summary r = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.28-0.47, P < 0.001, I2 = 94.7%; sleep quality: summary r = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.22-0.33, P < 0.001, I2 = 85.6%). The pooled correlations revealed some discrepancies when stratified by some moderators. The robustness of our findings was further confirmed by sensitivity analyses. The current meta-analysis provided solid evidence that MPA was positively correlated with anxiety, depression, impulsivity, and sleep quality. This indicated that college students with MPA were more likely to develop high levels of anxiety, depression, and impulsivity and suffer from poor sleep quality. More studies, especially large prospective studies, are warranted to verify our findings. ",
pmid_16914607,Holding an object: neural activity associated with fingertip force adjustments to external perturbations.,,"When you hold an object, a sudden unexpected perturbation can threaten the stability of your grasp. In such situations grasp stability is maintained by fast reflexive-like grip-force responses triggered by the somatosensory feedback. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural mechanisms involved in the grip-force responses associated with unexpected increases (loading) and decreases (unloading) in the load force. Healthy right-handed subjects held an instrumented object (of mass 200 g) between the tips of right index finger and thumb. At some time during an interval of 8 to 45 s the weight of the object was suddenly increased or decreased by 90 g. We analyzed the transient increases in the fMRI signal that corresponded precisely in time to these grip-force responses. Activity in the left primary motor cortex was associated with the loading response, but not with unloading, suggesting that sensorimotor processing in this area mediates the sensory-triggered reflexive increase in grip force during loading. Both the loading and the unloading events activated the cingulate motor area and the medial cerebellum. We suggest that these regions could participate in the updating of the sensorimotor representations of the fingertip forces. Finally, the supplementary somatosensory area located on the medial wall of the parietal lobe showed an increase in activity only during unloading, indicating that this area is involved in the sensorimotor processing generating the unloading response. Taken together, our findings suggest different central mechanisms for the grip-force responses during loading and unloading. ",

Compared with controls, ADHD boys under placebo showed bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal, middle temporal, and cerebellar underactivation. Within patients, MPX relative to ATX and placebo significantly upregulated right ventrolateral prefrontal activation, which correlated with enhanced inhibitory capacity. Relative to controls, both drugs significantly normalized the left ventrolateral prefrontal underactivation observed under placebo, while MPX had a drug-specific effect of normalizing right ventrolateral prefrontal and cerebellar underactivation observed under both placebo and ATX. The findings show shared and drug-specific effects of MPX and ATX on performance and brain activation during inhibitory control in ADHD patients with superior upregulation and normalization effects of MPX.

Right-handed subjects performed a serial reaction time task with colour-coded stimuli to eliminate the potential for learned eye-movements. The task was performed with the right hand under two different conditions. In one condition, subjects simultaneously performed a distractor task. Although they did show behavioural evidence of learning, they were not explicitly aware of the stimulus-response sequence. In the second condition, there was no distractor task, and seven out of the 11 subjects then became explicitly aware of the stimulus sequence. Metabolic correlates of learning were distinct in the two conditions. When learning was implicit under dual-task conditions, learning-related changes were observed in left motor and supplementary motor cortex as well as in the putamen. These regions are similar to those observed in a previous study in which the stimuli were cued by spatial position. Under single-task conditions, metabolic changes were found in the right prefrontal cortex and premotor cortex, as well as in the temporal lobe. A similar shift to the right hemisphere was observed in the spatial study during single-task learning. However, explicit learning of the task with colour stimuli activated more ventral regions. The areas supporting motor-sequence learning are contingent on both stimulus properties and attentional constraints. ",
pmid_18329904,Neural correlates of age-related changes in cortical neurophysiology.,,"Functional imaging studies of cortical motor systems in humans have demonstrated age-related reorganisation often attributed to anatomical and physiological changes. In this study we investigated whether aspects of brain activity during a motor task were influenced not only by age, but also by neurophysiological parameters of the motor cortex contralateral to the moving hand. Twenty seven right-handed volunteers underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging whilst performing repetitive isometric right hand grips in which the target force was parametrically varied between 15 and 55% of each subject's own maximum grip force. For each subject we characterised two orthogonal parameters, B(G) (average task-related activity for all hand grips) and B(F) (the degree to which task-related activity co-varied with peak grip force). We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to assess task-related changes in interhemispheric inhibition from left to right motor cortex (IHIc) and to perform measures relating to left motor cortex excitability during activation of the right hand. Firstly, we found that B(G) in right (ipsilateral) motor cortex was greater with increasing values of age(2) and IHIc. Secondly, B(F) in left ventral premotor cortex was greater in older subjects and in those in whom contralateral M1 was less responsive to TMS stimulation. In both cases, neurophysiological parameters accounted for variability in brain responses over and above that explained by ageing. These results indicate that neurophysiological markers may be better indicators of biological ageing than chronological age and point towards the mechanisms by which reconfiguration of distributed brain networks occurs in the face of degenerative changes.

pmid_19811532,Fasting biases brain reward systems towards high-calorie foods.,,"Nutritional state (e.g. fasted vs. fed) and different food stimuli (e.g. high-calorie vs. low-calorie, or appetizing vs. bland foods) are both recognized to change activity in brain reward systems. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we have studied the interaction between nutritional state and different food stimuli on brain food reward systems. We examined how blood oxygen level-dependent activity within a priori regions of interest varied while viewing pictures of high-calorie and low-calorie foods. Pictures of non-food household objects were included as control stimuli. During scanning, subjects rated the appeal of each picture. Twenty non-obese healthy adults [body mass index 22.1 +/- 0.5 kg/m(2) (mean +/- SEM), age range 19-35 years, 10 male] were scanned on two separate mornings between 11:00 and 12:00 h, once after eating a filling breakfast ('fed': 1.6 +/- 0.1 h since breakfast), and once after an overnight fast but skipping breakfast ('fasted': 15.9 +/- 0.3 h since supper) in a randomized cross-over design. Fasting selectively increased activation to pictures of high-calorie over low-calorie foods in the ventral striatum, amygdala, anterior insula, and medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Furthermore, fasting enhanced the subjective appeal of high-calorie more than low-calorie foods, and the change in appeal bias towards high-calorie foods was positively correlated with medial and lateral OFC activation. These results demonstrate an interaction between homeostatic and hedonic aspects of feeding behaviour, with fasting biasing brain reward systems towards high-calorie foods. ",
pmid_24200209,A preliminary investigation of Stroop-related intrinsic connectivity in cocaine dependence: associations with treatment outcomes.,,"Cocaine-dependent individuals demonstrate neural and behavioral differences compared to healthy comparison subjects when performing the Stroop color-word interference test. Stroop measures also relate to treatment outcome for cocaine dependence. Intrinsic connectivity analyses assess the extent to which task-related regional brain activations are related to each other in the absence of defining a priori regions of interest. This study examined 1) the extent to which cocaine-dependent and non-addicted individuals differed on measures of intrinsic connectivity during fMRI Stroop performance; and 2) the relationships between fMRI Stroop intrinsic connectivity and treatment outcome in cocaine dependence. Sixteen treatment-seeking cocaine-dependent patients and matched non-addicted comparison subjects completed an fMRI Stroop task. Between-group differences in intrinsic connectivity were assessed and related to self-reported and urine-toxicology-based cocaine-abstinence measures. Cocaine-dependent patients vs. comparison subjects showed less intrinsic connectivity in cortical and subcortical regions. When adjusting for individual degree of intrinsic connectivity, cocaine-dependent vs. comparison subjects showed relatively greater intrinsic connectivity in the ventral striatum, putamen, inferior frontal gyrus, anterior insula, thalamus and substantia nigra. Non-mean-adjusted intrinsic-connectivity measures in the midbrain, thalamus, ventral striatum, substantia nigra, insula and hippocampus negatively correlated with measures of cocaine abstinence. The diminished intrinsic connectivity in cocaine-dependent vs. comparison subjects suggests poorer communication across brain regions during cognitive-control processes. In mean-adjusted analyses, the cocaine-dependent group displayed relatively greater Stroop-related connectivity in regions implicated in motivational processes in addictions. The relationships between treatment outcomes and connectivity in the midbrain and basal ganglia suggest that connectivity represents a potential treatment target. ",

Independent component analysis
Internet gaming disorder","This study utilized independent component analysis to explore the abnormal functional connectivity (FC) in male participants with Internet gaming disorder (IGD). Functional magnetic resonance imaging and behavioral data were collected from 21 healthy controls (HC) and 18 IGD patients when they were performing a delay discounting task. Behavioral results revealed that the IGD patients showed higher delay discounting rates than HC. Two networks were found to be associated with IGD: (1) the executive control network containing the anterior cingulate cortex and the medial and superior frontal gyrus, and (2) the basal ganglia network containing the lentiform nucleus. Comparing to HC, IGD exhibited stronger FC when selecting small and now options. In addition, the delay discounting rates were positively correlated with the modulation of the two networks and the reaction time. The results suggested that the IGD patients have enhanced sensitivity to reward and decreased ability to control their impulsivity effectively, which leads to myopic decision making. ",

resting-state","To investigate the modulatory effect of acupuncture treatment on the resting-state functional connectivity of brain regions in migraine without aura (MWoA) patients. Twelve MWoA patients were treated with standard acupuncture treatment for 4 weeks. All MWoA patients received resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning before and after acupuncture treatment. Another 12 normal subjects matched in age and gender were recruited to serve as healthy controls. The changes of restingstate functional connectivity in MWoA patients before and after the acupuncture treatment and those with the healthy controls were compared. Before acupuncture treatment, the MWoA patients had significantly decreased functional connectivity in certain brain regions within the frontal and temporal lobe when compared with the healthy controls. After acupuncture treatment, brain regions showing decreased functional connectivity revealed significant reduction in MWoA patients compared with before acupuncture treatment. Acupuncture treatment could increase the functional connectivity of brain regions in the intrinsic decreased brain networks in MWoA patients. The results provided further insights into the interpretation of neural mechanisms of acupuncture treatment for migraine. ",

It is increasingly recognized that DLPFC regions play a role in mood regulation and the integration of emotion and cognition. The purpose of the present study was to investigate with fMRI the interaction between acute sadness and working memory functioning in individuals with bipolar disorder. Nine depressed individuals with DSM-IV bipolar I disorder (BP-I) and 17 healthy control participants matched for age, gender, education, and IQ completed a 2-back working memory paradigm under no mood induction, neutral state, or acute sadness conditions while undergoing fMRI scanning. Functional MRI data were analyzed with SPM2 using a random-effects model. Behaviorally, BP-I subjects performed equally well as control participants on the 2-back working memory paradigm. Compared to control participants, individuals with BP-I were characterized by more sadness-specific activation increases in the left DLPFC (BA 9/46) and left dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC). Our study documents sadness-specific abnormalities in the left DLPFC and dACC in bipolar disorder that suggest difficulties in the integration of emotion (sadness) and cognition. These preliminary findings require further corroboration with larger sample sizes of medication-free subjects. ",

A prospective study employing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted. Twelve sciatica patients were enrolled to receive six or 18 acupoints of acupuncture treatment twice a week for 4 weeks. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) and seed-based FC were performed. Regional homogeneity analysis demonstrated a greater alteration in the right posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) during the pre-acupuncture phase than during the postacupuncture phase. Compared to that of healthy controls, the PCC-seeded FC (default mode network, DMN) of sciatica patients exhibited hyperconnectivity of PCC-FC with the PCC-bilateral insula, cerebellum, inferior parietal lobule, right medial prefrontal cortex, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex during the pre-acupuncture phase as well as hypoconnectivity of PCC-FC with the right cerebellum, left precuneus, and left dorsal medial prefrontal cortex during the postacupuncture phase. Correlation analysis between PCC-seeded FC and behavior measurements revealed a positive association with the duration of sciatica in the right inferior parietal lobule prior to acupuncture treatment. Acupuncture in chronic sciatica patients is associated with normalized DMN activity and modulation of descending pain processing. The changes in the subclinical endophenotype of brain FC after acupuncture treatment may provide clues for understanding the mechanism of acupuncture-mediated analgesia in chronic pain. ",

Executive function
Resting-state fMRI","Deficit schizophrenia (DS) is a distinct subtype of schizophrenia characterized by primary and enduring negative symptoms. More severe executive dysfunctions were observed in DS patients, however, the associated neuroimaging characteristics, especially cerebellar functional anomalies in DS, remain largely unknown. We employed resting-state functional and structural MRI data of 106 male participants, including data from 29 DS patients, 39 non-deficit schizophrenia (NDS) patients and 38 healthy controls (HCs). Z-standardized fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (zfALFF) values were calculated in order to examine spontaneous regional brain activity. Cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity and changes in the volume of gray matter in the cerebellum were also examined. Relative to the HCs, both DS and NDS patients exhibited decreased zfALFF in the bilateral cerebellar lobules VIII and IX. The zfALFF in the left Crus II was lower in DS patients compared to NDS patients. No significant difference was observed in the volume of cerebellar gray matter among the three groups. Compared with NDS patients, cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity analysis revealed increased connectivity in the left orbital medial frontal cortex and right putamen regions in DS patients. Reduced zfALFF in the left Crus II in the DS group was significantly positively correlated with Stroop Color and Word scores, while negatively correlated with Trail-Making Test part B scores. The increased functional connectivity in the right putamen in DS patients was significantly positively correlated with Animal Naming Test and semantic Verbal Fluency Test scores. These results highlight cerebellar functional abnormality in DS patients and provide insight into the pathophysiological mechanism of executive dysfunction. ",

In order to provide a common framework within which to discuss the characteristics of the cognitive and behavioural syndromes of ALS, and with which to conduct clinical and neuropathological research, an international research workshop on frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and ALS was held in London, Canada in June 2007.

pmid_11831564,"Assessing executive functions in children: biological, psychological, and developmental considerationst.",,"Executive functions may be defined as those skills necessary for purposeful, goal-directed activity, and are generally considered to be largely mediated by the frontal and prefrontal cortices of the brain. These cerebral regions are relatively immature during childhood, with development thought to be a protracted process which continues into early adolescence. While early theorists suggested that executive skills were not functional until cerebral maturity, recent research provides evidence that such skills can be elicited in early childhood. The aim of this paper is to review current theories of development of executive functions throughout childhood. In keeping with contemporary approaches to child neuropsychology, three critical dimensions will be evaluated; biological factors, psychological dimensions, and developmental trajectories. In addition, the literature which addresses assessment of these functions will be examined, with reference to developmental trajectories observed in normal populations, and in brain-damaged samples, where there may be disruption to the underlying neural substrates thought to be subsuming these functions.

pmid_17400195,An event related functional magnetic resonance imaging study of facial emotion processing in Asperger syndrome.,,"People with Asperger syndrome (AS) have life-long deficits in social behavior. The biological basis of this is unknown, but most likely includes impaired processing of facial emotion. Human social communication involves processing different facial emotions, and at different intensities. However nobody has examined brain function in people with AS when implicitly (unconsciously) processing four primary emotions at varying emotional intensities. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine neural responses when people with AS and controls implicitly processed neutral expressions, and mild (25%) and intense (100%) expressions of fear, disgust, happiness, and sadness. We included 18 right-handed adults; 9 with AS and 9 healthy controls who did not differ significantly in IQ. Both groups significantly activated 'face perception' areas when viewing neutral faces, including fusiform and extrastriate cortices. Further, both groups had significantly increased activation of fusiform and other extrastriate regions to increasing intensities of fear and happiness. However, people with AS generally showed fusiform and extrastriate hyporesponsiveness compared to controls across emotion types and intensities. Fusiform and extrastriate cortices are activated by facial expressions of four primary emotions in people with AS, but generally to a lesser degree than controls. This may partly explain the social impairments of people with AS. ",
pmid_16024761,A systematic review of clinical trials of hormone therapy on cognitive function: effects of age at initiation and progestin use.,,"The putative protective effects of hormone therapy (HT) have been cast in doubt by recent findings from the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study showing an increase in dementia and an increased likelihood of impaired cognitive status in women initiating HT after age 65. To explore the external generalizability of those findings to younger postmenopausal women, the medical literature was surveyed for randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of treatment with either estrogen alone or estrogen plus a progestin on neuropsychological test performance. Findings from trials in younger women (<65 years) are presented separately from those in older women (>or=65 years). This review finds little support for beneficial cognitive effects in older women of estrogen alone or in combination with progestin. However, evidence from younger women suggests potential beneficial effects in select cognitive domains, particularly among symptomatic women and recently menopausal women, and scant evidence of harm. There is a dearth of studies of the cognitive effects of estrogen plus progestin in younger women. Future studies systematically exploring the effect of age and progestin use are needed to better characterize the effects of HT on cognition in younger women. Without firm evidence of benefit to younger women, it is prudent to caution early postmenopausal women about the cognitive risks observed in WHI, recognizing the low likelihood of dementia at that age.

Psychopathology","The stop-signal task has been used extensively to investigate the neural correlates of inhibition deficits in children with ADHD. However, previous findings of atypical brain activation during the stop-signal task in children with ADHD may be confounded with attentional processes, precluding strong conclusions on the nature of these deficits. In addition, there are recent concerns on the construct validity of the SSRT metric. The aim of this study was to control for confounding factors and improve the specificity of the stop-signal task to investigate inhibition mechanisms in children with ADHD. FMRI was used to measure inhibition related brain activation in 17 typically developing children (TD) and 21 children with ADHD, using a highly controlled version of the stop-signal task. Successful inhibition trials were contrasted with control trials that were comparable in frequency, visual presentation and absence of motor response. We found reduced brain activation in children with ADHD in key inhibition areas, including the right inferior frontal gyrus/insula, and anterior cingulate/dorsal medial prefrontal cortex. Using a more stringent controlled design, this study replicated and specified previous findings of atypical brain activation in ADHD during motor response inhibition. ",
pmid_12928061,Similar network activated by young and old adults during the acquisition of a motor sequence.,,"In this functional MRI (fMRI) study, we investigated ageing effects on motor skill learning. We applied an adapted version of the serial reaction time (SRT) task to extensive groups of young (N=26) and elderly (N=40) subjects. Since indications have been provided for age-related shrinkage of brain regions assumed to be critical to motor skill learning, we tested the hypothesis that age effects on implicit sequence learning are larger on a neurofunctional level than on a behavioural level. The SRT task consisted of two identical scan sessions, in which subjects had to manually trail an asterisk appearing serially in one of four spatial positions by means of button-pressing. Reliable response time reductions were already found in the first session for both the young and the elderly groups, when comparing a fixed sequence condition to a random sequence, but the learning effect was greater for the young subjects. In the second session, though, both groups showed a similar degree of learning. This indicates that implicit sequence learning is still intact in elderly adults, but that the rate of learning is somewhat slower. Reliable learning-related changes in brain activity were also observed. A similar network of brain regions was recruited by both groups during the fixed compared to the random sequence, involving several regions that have been previously associated with implicit sequence learning, including bilateral parietal, and frontal regions, the supplementary motor area (SMA), cerebellum and the basal ganglia. The direct group comparison did not reveal any differences in brain activity. In addition, we did not observe any significant differences in activity when comparing the different sessions either, neither for the young nor for the elderly subjects. Hence, we did not find indications for an age-related functional reorganisation of neural networks involved in motor sequence learning. In view of earlier reports of pronounced ageing effects on the performance on declarative memory tasks, our finding of age-related sparing of processes that sustain motor skill learning, provides further support for the proposition of different memory systems relying on different brain substrates.

pmid_24885073,Trait impulsivity and impaired prefrontal impulse inhibition function in adolescents with internet gaming addiction revealed by a Go/No-Go fMRI study.,,"Recent studies suggest that Internet gaming addiction (IGA) is an impulse disorder, or is at least related to impulse control disorders. In the present study, we hypothesized that different facets of trait impulsivity may be specifically linked to the brain regions with impaired impulse inhibition function in IGA adolescents. Seventeen adolescents with IGA and seventeen healthy controls were scanned during performance of a response-inhibition Go/No-Go task using a 3.0 T MRI scanner. The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS)-11 was used to assess impulsivity. There were no differences in the behavioral performance on the Go/No-Go task between the groups. However, the IGA group was significantly hyperactive during No-Go trials in the left superior medial frontal gyrus, right anterior cingulate cortex, right superior/middle frontal gyrus, left inferior parietal lobule, left precentral gyrus, and left precuneus and cuneus. Further, the bilateral middle temporal gyrus, bilateral inferior temporal gyrus, and right superior parietal lobule were significantly hypoactive during No-Go trials. Activation of the left superior medial frontal gyrus was positively associated with BIS-11 and Chen Internet Addiction Scale (CIAS) total score across IGA participants. Our data suggest that the prefrontal cortex may be involved in the circuit modulating impulsivity, while its impaired function may relate to high impulsivity in adolescents with IGA, which may contribute directly to the Internet addiction process.

pmid_20053346,Alterations in regional homogeneity of resting-state brain activity in autism spectrum disorders.,,"Measures assessing resting-state brain activity with blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can reveal cognitive disorders at an early stage. Analysis of regional homogeneity (ReHo) measures the local synchronization of spontaneous fMRI signals and has been successfully utilized in detecting alterations in subjects with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's dementia. Resting-state brain activity was investigated in 28 adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 27 typically developing controls being imaged with BOLD fMRI and analyzed with the ReHo method. The hypothesis was that ReHo of resting-state brain activity would be different between ASD subjects and controls in brain areas previously shown to display functional alterations in stimulus or task based fMRI studies. Compared with the controls, the subjects with ASD had significantly decreased ReHo in right superior temporal sulcus region, right inferior and middle frontal gyri, bilateral cerebellar crus I, right insula and right postcentral gyrus. Significantly increased ReHo was discovered in right thalamus, left inferior frontal and anterior subcallosal gyrus and bilateral cerebellar lobule VIII. We conclude that subjects with ASD have right dominant ReHo alterations of resting-state brain activity, i.e., areas known to exhibit abnormal stimulus or task related functionality. Our results demonstrate that there is potential in utilizing the ReHo method in fMRI analyses of ASD. ",
pmid_22079448,Neural insensitivity to upticks in value is associated with the disposition effect.,,"The disposition effect is a phenomenon in which investors hold onto losing assets longer than they hold onto gaining assets. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the response of valuation regions in the brain during the decision to keep or to sell an asset that followed a random walk in price. The most common explanation for the disposition effect is preference-based: namely, that people are risk-averse over gains and risk-seeking over losses. This explanation would predict correlations between individuals' risk-preferences, the magnitude of their disposition effect, and activation in valuation structures of the brain. We did not observe these correlations. Nor did we find evidence for a realization utility explanation, which would predict differential responses in valuation regions during the decision to sell versus keep an asset that correlated with the magnitude of the disposition effect. Instead, we found an attenuated ventral striatum response to upticks in value below the purchase price in some individuals with a large disposition effect. Given the role of the striatum in signaling prediction error, the blunted striatal response is consistent with the expectation that an asset will rise when it is below the purchase price, thus spurring loss-holding behavior. This suggests that for some individuals, the disposition effect is likely driven by a belief that the asset will eventually return to the purchase price, also known as mean reversion. ",

Human connectome project
Inter-subject variability
Resting-state functional MRI","Global signal regression (GSR) is one of the most debated preprocessing strategies for resting-state functional MRI. GSR effectively removes global artifacts driven by motion and respiration, but also discards globally distributed neural information and introduces negative correlations between certain brain regions. The vast majority of previous studies have focused on the effectiveness of GSR in removing imaging artifacts, as well as its potential biases. Given the growing interest in functional connectivity fingerprinting, here we considered the utilitarian question of whether GSR strengthens or weakens associations between resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and multiple behavioral measures across cognition, personality and emotion. By applying the variance component model to the Brain Genomics Superstruct Project (GSP), we found that behavioral variance explained by whole-brain RSFC increased by an average of 47% across 23 behavioral measures after GSR. In the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we found that behavioral variance explained by whole-brain RSFC increased by an average of 40% across 58 behavioral measures, when GSR was applied after ICA-FIX de-noising. To ensure generalizability, we repeated our analyses using kernel regression. GSR improved behavioral prediction accuracies by an average of 64% and 12% in the GSP and HCP datasets respectively. Importantly, the results were consistent across methods. A behavioral measure with greater RSFC-explained variance (using the variance component model) also exhibited greater prediction accuracy (using kernel regression). A behavioral measure with greater improvement in behavioral variance explained after GSR (using the variance component model) also enjoyed greater improvement in prediction accuracy after GSR (using kernel regression). Furthermore, GSR appeared to benefit task performance measures more than self-reported measures. Since GSR was more effective at removing motion-related and respiratory-related artifacts, GSR-related increases in variance explained and prediction accuracies were unlikely the result of motion-related or respiratory-related artifacts. However, it is worth emphasizing that the current study focused on whole-brain RSFC, so it remains unclear whether GSR improves RSFC-behavioral associations for specific connections or networks. Overall, our results suggest that at least in the case for young healthy adults, GSR strengthens the associations between RSFC and most (although not all) behavioral measures. Code for the variance component model and ridge regression can be found here: https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable_projects/preprocessing/Li2019_GSR. ",
pmid_16445387,A shift from diffuse to focal cortical activity with development.,,"Recent imaging studies have suggested that developmental changes may parallel aspects of adult learning in cortical activation becoming less diffuse and more focal over time. However, while adult learning studies examine changes within subjects, developmental findings have been based on cross-sectional samples and even comparisons across studies. Here, we used functional MRI in children to test directly for shifts in cortical activity during performance of a cognitive control task, in a combined longitudinal and cross-sectional study. Our longitudinal findings, relative to our cross-sectional ones, show attenuated activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortical areas, paralleled by increased focal activation in ventral prefrontal regions related to task performance.

pmid_20926674,Tuning curves for movement direction in the human visuomotor system.,,"Neurons in macaque primary motor cortex (M1) are broadly tuned to arm movement direction. Recent evidence suggests that human M1 contains directionally tuned neurons, but it is unclear which other areas are part of the network coding movement direction and what characterizes the responses of neuronal populations in those areas. Such information would be highly relevant for the implementation of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in paralyzed patients. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation to identify which areas of the human brain show directional selectivity and the degree to which these areas are affected by the type of motor act (to press vs to grasp). After adapting participants to one particular hand movement direction, we measured the release from adaptation during occasional test trials, parametrically varying the angular difference between adaptation and test direction. We identified multiple areas broadly tuned to movement direction, including M1, dorsal premotor cortex, intraparietal sulcus, and the parietal reach region. Within these areas, we observed a gradient of directional selectivity, with highest directional selectivity in the right parietal reach region, for both right- and left-hand movements. Moreover, directional selectivity was modulated by the type of motor act to varying degrees, with the largest effect in M1 and the smallest modulation in the parietal reach region. These data provide an important extension of our knowledge about directional tuning in the human brain. Furthermore, our results suggest that the parietal reach region might be an ideal candidate for the implementation of BCI in paralyzed patients. ",

Visual hallucinations","Visual hallucinations are an important non-motor complication of Parkinson's disease (PD) and carry a negative prognosis. Their biological basis is uncertain, but may relate to the activity of resting state networks in brain. We therefore aimed to investigate functional activity of brain in patients with visual hallucinations (PDVH) in resting state compared to patients without hallucinations (PDnonVH) and a healthy control group (HC). Resting state functional MRI was acquired and the primary analysis compared the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) across groups. This informed a secondary analysis, in the PD groups only, comparing functional connectivity between a 'seed' region in the occipital lobe and the rest of the brain. Individuals with PDVH showed lower ALFF in bilateral lingual gyrus and cuneus and greater ALFF in temporo-parietal regions, medial temporal gyrus and cerebellum than PDnonVH and HC. PDnonVH also had lower ALFF in occipitoparietal region and greater ALFF in medial temporal gyrus, temporo-parietal and cerebellum regions than HC. Functional connectivity analysis revealed that, although both PD groups had lower occipital functional connectivity relative to the HC group, occipital - corticostriatal connectivity was significantly higher in those with PDVH compared with PDnonVH. Our study reveals widespread hemodynamic alterations in PD. However, within a functionally abnormal occipital lobe, those with PDVH have even lower ALFF than non-hallucinators, but have higher occipital functional connectivity with cortical-striatal regions. These findings suggest disruption of pathways underpinning both primary visual perceptual and intrinsic visual integration may contribute to visual hallucinations in PD. ",
pmid_22015111,Fronto-striato-cerebellar dysregulation in adolescents with depression during motivated attention.,,"Pediatric major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with deficits in sustained attention, thought to be related to underlying motivation deficits. This hypothesis, however, has never directly been tested using functional magnetic resonance imaging. In this study, we investigated the neurofunctional correlates of the interplay between attention and motivation in medication-naive pediatric MDD using a rewarded sustained attention task. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to compare brain activation between 20 medication-naïve, noncomorbid, first-episode adolescents with MDD aged 13 to 18 years and 21 gender-, age-, and IQ-matched healthy adolescents. Participants performed a sustained attention task with and without a monetary reward to assess the impact of reward on sustained attention networks. During nonrewarded sustained attention, adolescents with MDD showed reduced activation compared with healthy control subjects in occipital cortex. When sustained attention was rewarded, however, the underactivation in adolescents with MDD was in an extensive right hemispheric network of inferior fronto-striato-thalamic attention and limbic hippocampus-anterior cingulate reward processing areas. Major depressive disorder patients showed increased activation in cerebellum, which correlated with reduced frontal activation and depressive symptoms, suggesting compensatory response. Further analysis showed that reward upregulated fronto-striatal and hippocampal/temporal activation in control subjects but deactivated these regions in MDD, with opposite effects in the cerebellum. Medication-naïve MDD adolescents show abnormalities in the regulation in fronto-striato-cerebellar brain regions involved in attention and reward during motivated but not unmotivated attention. This suggests a dysfunctional interplay between motivation and cognition in pediatric MDD, where motivation appears less capable of upregulating attention networks relative to healthy youths. ",

Emerging neuroscience evidence implicates multiple brain systems and neurochemical mediators, including opioids and dopamine. We present an empirical review of the brain systems that are involved in placebo effects, focusing on placebo analgesia, and a conceptual framework linking these findings to the mind-brain processes that mediate them. This framework suggests that the neuropsychological processes that mediate placebo effects may be crucial for a wide array of therapeutic approaches, including many drugs. ",
pmid_15289277,Anomalous prefrontal-subcortical activation in familial pediatric bipolar disorder: a functional magnetic resonance imaging investigation.,,"The neurobiological features of pediatric bipolar disorder (BD) are largely unknown. Children and adolescents with BD may be important to study with functional neuroimaging techniques because of their unique status of early-onset BD and high familial loading for the disorder. Neuroimaging studies of adults with BD have implicated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the development of this disorder. To study children and adolescents with BD via functional magnetic resonance imaging using cognitive and affective tasks and to examine possible abnormalities in the DLPFC and ACC, as well as selected subcortical areas, in pediatric familial BD. We evaluated 12 male subjects aged 9 to 18 years with BD who had at least 1 parent with BD as well as 10 age- and IQ-matched healthy male controls. Stimulants were discontinued for at least 24 hours; other medications were continued. Subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T while performing a 2-back visuospatial working memory task and an affective task involving the visualization of positively, neutrally, or negatively valenced pictures. An academic referral setting, drawing from the Bay Area of San Francisco, Calif. Compared with controls, for the visuospatial working memory task, subjects with BD had greater activation in several areas including the bilateral ACC, left putamen, left thalamus, left DLPFC, and right inferior frontal gyrus. Controls had greater activation in the cerebellar vermis. In viewing negatively valenced pictures, subjects with BD had greater activation in the bilateral DLPFC, inferior frontal gyrus, and right insula. Controls had greater activation in the right posterior cingulate gyrus. For positively valenced pictures, subjects with BD had greater activation in the bilateral caudate and thalamus, left middle/superior frontal gyrus, and left ACC, whereas controls had no areas of greater activation. Children and adolescents with BD may have underlying abnormalities in the regulation of prefrontal-subcortical circuits. Further functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of attention and mood with greater sample sizes are needed. ",
pmid_9425182,PET study of pointing with visual feedback of moving hands.,,"This study was conducted to determine where in the human brain visual feedback of hand movements is processed to allow accurate pointing. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured with positron emission tomography (PET) and H2 15O in nine normal volunteers while performing one control and two reaching tasks. In all tasks, visual stimuli were presented on a head mounted display (HMD). A target board was placed in front of the subjects bearing six red light-emitting diodes (LEDs) aligned on a circle with a green LED at its center. The center green LED and one of the six red LEDs, randomly selected, were repeatedly switched on and off, alternatively. In the control task, subjects were instructed to gaze at the lit LED. In the two reaching tasks, the reaching with visual feedback (RwithF) task and the reaching without visual feedback (RwithoutF) task, they had to point to the lit red LED with their right index fingers. In the RwithF task, their right hands were visible on the HMD before touching the target, whereas in the RwithoutF task, they were not visible. For each subject, subtraction images of each reaching task minus the control and the RwithF task minus the RwithoutF task were calculated after transformation of PET images into the standard brain shape with an adjustable computerized brain atlas. These subtraction rCBF images were then averaged among the subjects, and significant changes of rCBF were identified. Significant increases in rCBF not only in the RwithF task minus control image but also in the RwithF task minus the RwithoutF task image were observed in the supramarginal cortex, the premotor cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex of the left hemisphere, the caudate nucleus and the thalamus of the right hemisphere, and the right cerebellum and vermis. These results indicate that the supramarginal cortex, the premotor cortex, and the posterior cingulate cortex of the left hemisphere and the cerebellum are involved in integrating visual feedback of hand movements and execution of accurate pointing.

pmid_16542513,Altered functional neuroanatomy of response inhibition in adolescent males who were born very preterm.,,"Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate the hypothesis that males who were born very preterm may show differences in relative strength of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals in selective brain areas during performance of a simple response inhibition task compared with term-born controls. Participants were eight males (mean gestational age at birth 28wks, [SD 2]; mean age at testing 16y, [SD 1] and 14 controls matched for sex, age (mean age 17y, [SD 1]), and IQ. A 'go-no-go' task was used to assess response selection and motor response inhibition in response to a visual stimulus. When the 'no-go' condition was contrasted with an attentional control condition, preterm participants showed reduced BOLD signal response bilaterally in the cerebellum, right caudate nucleus, and thalamus, and prefrontal areas including left inferior prefrontal and left anterior cingulate gyri. They also showed increased response mainly in temporal regions. These results suggest that despite good task performance, individuals who were born very preterm exhibit different BOLD signal responses in selective brain areas compared with controls which may underline the use of alternative strategies when challenged with motor response inhibition processing.

However, whether abnormal activation of localized brain areas would affect network dysfunction remains to be fully characterized. We applied both univariate analysis and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) approaches to investigate the abnormalities of regional homogeneity (ReHo), an index to measure the localized connectivity, in 88 medication-free patients with OCD and 88 healthy control subjects (HCS). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) data of all the participants were acquired in a 3.0-T scanner. First, we adopted a traditional univariate analysis to explore ReHo alterations between the patient group and the control group. Subsequently, we utilized a support vector machine (SVM) to examine whether ReHo could be further used to differentiate patients with OCD from HCS at the individual level. Relative to HCS, OCD patients showed lower ReHo in the bilateral cerebellum and higher ReHo in the bilateral superior frontal gyri (SFG), right inferior parietal gyrus (IPG), and precuneus [ ",
pmid_22155218,The effects of exercise on the neuronal response to food cues.,,"Increased physical activity is associated with successful long-term weight loss maintenance due to mechanisms likely more complex than simply increased energy expenditure. The impact of physical activity on the central regulation of food intake may be an important mechanism of this effect. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of exercise training and acute exercise on the neuronal response to food cues as well as eating behaviors. fMRI was performed in the fasted state at baseline and again after a 6 month progressive exercise intervention (supervised, 5 days/wk) both with and without an acute exercise bout in 12 overweight/obese (5 women, 7 men; BMI 33 ± 4 kg/m(2)) healthy adults. fMRI data were acquired while subjects were presented with visual stimuli of foods of high hedonic value as compared to neutral control objects. Questionnaires on eating behaviors, ratings of appeal and desire for foods, and ratings of appetite (hunger, satiety, prospective intake) using visual analog scales were also performed at baseline and again after the 6-month exercise intervention. While only a trend was observed for a reduction in body weight (102 ± 5 to 99 ± 6 kg, p=0.09), a significant reduction in fat mass was observed (36.4 ± 2.8 to 33.7 ± 3.2 kg, p=0.04), although as expected changes in fat mass were variable (-10.0 to +3.7 kg). Chronic exercise was associated with a reduction in the neuronal response to food, primarily in the posterior attention network and insula. A significant positive correlation between the change in fat/body mass and the change in insula response to food cues with chronic exercise was observed. An acute exercise bout attenuated the effects of chronic exercise. The exercise intervention, however, did not impact any of the measures of appetitive behavior. In summary, despite no effects on behavioral measures of appetite, chronic exercise training was associated with attenuation in the response to visual food cues in brain regions known to be important in food intake regulation. The insula, in particular, appears to play an important role in the potential exercise-induced weight loss and weight loss maintenance. ",
pmid_11156806,"Structural abnormalities in frontal, temporal, and limbic regions and interconnecting white matter tracts in schizophrenic patients with prominent negative symptoms.",,"Imaging studies of schizophrenia have repeatedly demonstrated global abnormalities of cerebral and ventricular volumes. However, pathological changes at more local levels of brain organization have not yet been so clearly characterized because of the few brain regions of interest heretofore included in morphometric analyses as well as heterogeneity of patient samples. Dual echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were acquired at 1.5 T from 27 right-handed patients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia with enduring negative symptoms and from 27 healthy comparison subjects. Between-group differences in gray and white matter volume were estimated at each intracerebral voxel after registration of the images in standard space. The relationship between clinical symptom scores and brain structure was also examined within the patient group. Spatial statistics and permutation tests were used for inference. Significant deficits of gray matter volume in the patient group were found at three main locations: 1) the left superior temporal gyrus and insular cortex, 2) the left medial temporal lobe (including the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus), and 3) the anterior cingulate and medial frontal gyri. The volume of these three regions combined was 14% lower in the patients relative to the comparison subjects. White matter deficits were found in similar locations in the left temporal lobe and extended into the left frontal lobe. The patient group showed a relative excess of gray matter volume in the basal ganglia. Within the patient group, basal ganglia gray matter volume was positively correlated with positive symptom scores. Anatomical abnormalities in these schizophrenic patients with marked negative symptoms were most evident in left hemispheric neocortical and limbic regions and related white matter tracts. These data are compatible with models that depict schizophrenia as a supraregional disorder of multiple, distributed brain regions and the axonal connections between them. ",
pmid_23942213,Short-term effects of escitalopram on regional brain function in first-episode drug-naive patients with major depressive disorder assessed by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging.,,"Most knowledge regarding the effects of antidepressant drugs is at the receptor level, distal from the nervous system effects that mediate their clinical efficacy. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this study investigated the effects of escitalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), on resting-state brain function in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Fourteen first-episode drug-naive MDD patients completed two fMRI scans before and after 8 weeks of escitalopram therapy. Scans were also acquired in 14 matched healthy subjects. Data were analyzed using the regional homogeneity (ReHo) approach. Compared to controls, MDD patients before treatment demonstrated decreased ReHo in the frontal (right superior frontal gyrus), temporal (left middle and right inferior temporal gyri), parietal (right precuneus) and occipital (left superior occipital gyrus and right cuneus) cortices, and increased ReHo in the left dorsal medial prefrontal gyrus and left anterior lobe of the cerebellum. Compared to the unmedicated state, ReHo in the patients after treatment was decreased in the left dorsal medial prefrontal gyrus, the right insula and the bilateral thalamus, and increased in the right superior frontal gyrus. Compared to controls, patients after treatment displayed a ReHo decrease in the right precuneus and a ReHo increase in the left anterior lobe of the cerebellum. Successful treatment with escitalopram may be associated with modulation of resting-state brain activity in regions within the fronto-limbic circuit. This study provides new insight into the effects of antidepressants on functional brain systems in MDD. ",
pmid_18262208,Perception of biological motion in autism spectrum disorders.,,"In individuals with autism or autism-spectrum-disorder (ASD), conflicting results have been reported regarding the processing of biological motion tasks. As biological motion perception and recognition might be related to impaired imitation, gross motor skills and autism specific psychopathology in individuals with ASD, we performed a functional MRI study on biological motion perception in a sample of 15 adolescent and young adult individuals with ASD and typically developing, age, sex and IQ matched controls. Neuronal activation during biological motion perception was compared between groups, and correlation patterns of imitation, gross motor and behavioral measures with neuronal activation were explored. Differences in local gray matter volume between groups as well as correlation patterns of psychopathological measures with gray matter volume were additionally compared. On the behavioral level, recognition of biological motion was assessed by a reaction time (RT) task. Groups differed strongly with regard to neuronal activation and RT, and differential correlation patterns with behavioral as well as with imitation and gross motor abilities were elicited across and within groups. However, contrasting with the initial hypothesis, additional differences between groups were observed during perception and recognition of spatially moving point lights in general irrespective of biological motion. Results either point towards difficulties in higher-order motion perception or in the integration of complex motion information in the association cortex. This interpretation is supported by differences in gray matter volume as well as correlation with repetitive behavior bilaterally in the parietal cortex and the right medial temporal cortex. The specific correlation of neuronal activation during biological motion perception with hand-finger imitation, dynamic balance and diadochokinesis abilities emphasizes the possible relevance of difficulties in biological motion perception or impaired self-other matching for action imitation and gross motor difficulties in individuals with ASD.

Crowdfunding represents a significant and growing platform for funding new and unique projects, causes, and products. To test whether neural activity could forecast market-level crowdfunding outcomes weeks later, 30 human subjects (14 female) decided whether to fund proposed projects described on an Internet crowdfunding website while undergoing scanning with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Although activity in both the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and medial prefrontal cortex predicted individual choices to fund on a trial-to-trial basis in the neuroimaging sample, only NAcc activity generalized to forecast market funding outcomes weeks later on the Internet. Behavioral measures from the neuroimaging sample, however, did not forecast market funding outcomes. This pattern of associations was replicated in a second study. These findings demonstrate that a subset of the neural predictors of individual choice can generalize to forecast market-level crowdfunding outcomes-even better than choice itself. ",

A total of 216 college students (132 male and 84 female) were recruited in the study. The results demonstrated that 5/6 cutoff points of criteria A in DC-IA-C had the best diagnostic accuracy (95.9%). Besides, 63/64 and 67/68 cutoff points of the CIAS were evaluated to be the best screening and diagnostic cutoff points, respectively. The DC-IA-C can provide health care professionals with a means to diagnose and communicate about Internet addiction among college students, and the screening and diagnostic cutoff points of CIAS could provide a screening instrument or a discriminative instrument in surveys for Internet addiction among college students.

pmid_15852469,The effect of social content on deductive reasoning: an fMRI study.,,"Psychological studies of deductive reasoning have shown that subjects' performance is affected significantly by the content of the presented stimuli. Specifically, subjects find it easier to reason about contexts and situations with a social content. In the present study, the effect of content on brain activation was investigated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while subjects were solving two versions of the Wason selection task, which previous behavioral studies have shown to elicit a significant content effect. One version described an arbitrary relation between two actions (Descriptive: ""If someone does ..., then he does ...""), whereas the other described an exchange of goods between two persons (Social-Exchange: ""If you give me ..., then I give you ...""). Random-effect statistical analyses showed that compared to baseline, both tasks activated frontal medial cortex and left dorsolateral frontal and parietal regions, confirming the major role of the left hemisphere in deductive reasoning. In addition, although the two reasoning conditions were identical in logical form, the social-exchange task was also associated with right frontal and parietal activations, mirroring the left-sided activations common to both reasoning tasks. These results suggest that the recruitment of the right hemisphere is dependent on the content of the stimuli presented. ",
pmid_23483911,Frequency dependent alterations in regional homogeneity of baseline brain activity in schizophrenia.,,"Low frequency oscillations are essential in cognitive function impairment in schizophrenia. While functional connectivity can reveal the synchronization between distant brain regions, the regional abnormalities in task-independent baseline brain activity are less clear, especially in specific frequency bands. Here, we used a regional homogeneity (ReHo) method combined with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate low frequency spontaneous neural activity in the three different frequency bands (slow-5:0.01-0.027 Hz; slow-4:0.027-0.08 Hz; and typical band: 0.01-0.08 Hz) in 69 patients with schizophrenia and 62 healthy controls. Compared with controls, schizophrenia patients exhibited decreased ReHo in the precentral gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, and posterior insula, whereas increased ReHo in the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior insula. Significant differences in ReHo between the two bands were found in fusiform gyrus and superior frontal gyrus (slow-4> slow-5), and in basal ganglia, parahippocampus, and dorsal middle prefrontal gyrus (slow-5> slow-4). Importantly, we identified significant interaction between frequency bands and groups in the inferior occipital gyrus and caudate body. This study demonstrates that ReHo changes in schizophrenia are widespread and frequency dependent. ",

It is unclear if early changes in FC can predict treatment response in patients with schizophrenia. The study included 32 patients with drug-naive, first-episode schizophrenia and 32 healthy controls. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was obtained from the patients at two time-points (pre-treatment baseline and 1 week after treatment) and healthy controls at baseline. Patients were treated with olanzapine for 8 weeks, and clinical symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) at three time points (baseline, 1 week and 8 weeks after treatment). Imaging data were analyzed using global-brain FC (GFC) and support vector regression (SVR). At baseline, an increased GFC was observed in bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in patients compared with healthy controls. After 1 week of olanzapine treatment, patients showed decreased GFC in bilateral ACC compared to the baseline values. SVR analysis suggested a positive relationship between GFC changes in bilateral ACC at week 1 and improvement in negative symptoms at week 8 (r = 0.957, p < 0.001). An early decrease in GFC in bilateral ACC may serve as a predictor for treatment response in patients with schizophrenia. If further confirmed, our finding may be able to help clinicians decide, during the early treatment course, whether the patient should stay on the chosen antipsychotic medication or switch to a different one.

Resting-state fMRI","Although previous studies have consistently demonstrated that neurocognitive and social cognitive impairments are commonly observed in schizophrenia, the neural substrates of deficits of cognitive function remain unclear, especially for the chronic schizophrenia. There has been little resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) study of cognitive function in chronic schizophrenia. In this study we aimed to investigate the changes of rs-fMRI signals with regional homogeneity (ReHo), and explore the correlations between abnormal regional activity and cognitive function in chronic schizophrenia. Altogether 76 subjects, 37 patients with chronic schizophrenia and 39 normal controls matched approximately for age, gender and education level were enrolled. All subjects were evaluated psychotic symptoms by Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and cognitive function by Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Conventional MRI and rs-fMRI were performed in all subjects. ReHo was calculated to measure the temporal synchronization of a given voxel and its neighboring voxels based on Kendall coefficient of concordance (KCC) in the rs-fMRI. For the numbers of achieved categories, percentage of conceptual level response in the scores of WCST, the patient group was significantly lower than the control group (p<0.05). For the total errors, perseverative errors, non-perseverative errors, the patient group was significantly higher than the control group (p<0.05). Significant differences in ReHo were found in 11 regions (included five activated and five with decreased activity in the cerebrum and one with decreased activity in the cerebellum) in the chronic schizophrenia patients when compared with the normal controls. The ReHo map clusters that were significantly different between the two groups showed no significant correlation with clinical symptoms. Correlation of the whole brain with subscores of PANSS-T, PANSS-P, PANSS-N and WCST were significantly found in some regions. The study identified five increased and six decreased spontaneous synchrony in the cerebrum and cerebellum in chronic schizophrenia patients compared to the normal matched controls, which were associated with positive, negative symptoms, and deficits of executive functioning.

pmid_23313402,Differences in the neuronal response to food in obesity-resistant as compared to obesity-prone individuals.,,"Despite living in an obesogenic environment, some individuals maintain a thin phenotype compared to the majority who are at risk for weight gain and obesity. Understanding how these different phenotypes regulate energy intake is critical. The objective of this study was to examine the differences in neuronal response to visual food cues in adults recruited as either obesity-resistant (OR) or obesity-prone (OP) based on self-identification, BMI, and personal/family weight history. 25 OR and 28 OP individuals were studied after 4 days of eucaloric energy intake. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed in the fasted and acute fed states (30 min after a test meal) while subjects viewed images of foods of high hedonic value and neutral non-food objects. Measures of appetite using visual analog scales were performed before and every 30 min after the test meal for 3 h. In the fasted state, food as compared to nonfood images elicited significant response in the insula, somatosensory cortex, parietal cortex, and visual cortex in both OR and OP. The acute fed state resulted in significant attenuation of these and other brain areas in the OR but not OP individuals. Furthermore, OP as compared to OR individuals showed greater activation of medial and anterior prefrontal cortex (PFC) in response to the test meal. Adjusting for fat mass did not impact these results. Attenuation of insula/PFC response to food images in the fed state was associated with greater reductions in hunger. These findings suggest that individuals prone to weight gain and obesity have altered neuronal responses to food cues in brain regions known to be important in energy intake regulation. These altered responses may represent an important mechanism contributing to excess energy intake and risk for obesity. ",

At baseline, compared to HCs, patients with DS but not NDS had less WMV in bilateral posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) and cerebellar tonsil (P < 0.05, FDR corrected) and smaller GMV in the cerebellar culmen (P < 0.05, FWE corrected). At follow-up, NDS group showed WMV reduction in bilateral PLIC (P < 0.05, FDR corrected), while DS group showed no progressive WMV changes. While both patient groups exhibited GMV reduction in the hippocampus and insular cortex, patients with NDS showed additional GMV loss in the frontal and cingulate cortex and a selective increase in GMV in the left thalamus (P < 0.05 FWE corrected). Our study revealed double dissociations in developmental brain volume changes in the first year after clinical contact for psychosis in DS versus NDS patients. ",
pmid_19996309,Insulin modulates food-related activity in the central nervous system.,,"Previous data suggest a key role of central nervous insulin action in regulating energy homeostasis. We therefore investigated whether insulin modulates brain responses to food and nonfood pictures in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study. Nine healthy, normal-weight subjects underwent two functional magnetic resonance imaging measurements to compare the effects of insulin and placebo administration during a visual recognition task with food and nonfood pictures. Insulin was administered intranasally to raise insulin concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid without altering systemic effects in the periphery. Metabolic parameters were continuously determined during the experiments. We measured the changes in brain activity after intranasal insulin administration. Food pictures were detected faster when compared to nonfood pictures in all conditions without any effect of placebo or insulin. After insulin application, functional magnetic resonance imaging measurements showed a significantly reduced activity in the presence of food pictures compared to placebo in the right and left fusiform gyrus, the right hippocampus, the right temporal superior cortex, and the right frontal middle cortex. The brain activation induced by nonfood pictures remained unaffected by insulin. We demonstrate that intranasal insulin led to a reduction of activity in brain areas related to object processing and memory and may have an effect on brain activation with regard to the processing of food pictures. This effect might be part of a mechanism that terminates food intake in the postprandial state. ",

fMRI","In western cultures, we are surrounded by appealing visual food cues that stimulate our desire to eat, overeating and subsequent weight gain. Cognitive control of appetite (reappraisal) requires substantial attentional resources and effort in order to work. Therefore, we tested an alternative approach for appetite regulation via functional magnetic resonance imaging. Healthy, normal-weight women were presented with images depicting food (high-/low-caloric), once in combination with a bitter aftertaste (a gustatory stop signal) and once with a neutral taste (water), in a retest design. The aversive aftertaste elicited increased activation in the orbitofrontal/dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (OFC, DLPFC), striatum and frontal operculum during the viewing of high-caloric food (vs. low-caloric food). In addition, the increase in DLPFC activity to high-caloric food in the bitter condition was correlated with reported appetite reduction. The findings indicate that this aftertaste procedure was able to reduce the appetitive value of visual food cues. ",

Resting-state FC analyses were used to identify the component brain regions of the intrinsic organization and to investigate the FCs of the individual component regions in 18 first-episode, medication-naïve MDD and 20 healthy control subjects. We found that the intrinsic organization of the depressed group recruited more extensive regions than the control group. All of the altered FCs associated with the component regions increased in MDD. Specifically, in the TPN the increased FCs were primarily located in the bilateral lateral prefrontal cortices and the inferior parietal lobes, which have been implicated in attention and adaptive control. In the TNN, the increased FCs were primarily located in the posterior cingulate cortex and the medial orbitofrontal cortex, which are involved in episodic memory, self-reflection and emotional regulation. We also found increased anti-correlations between the two networks. Additionally, the strengths of the FCs associated with the lateral prefrontal cortices were found to be correlated with the duration of the depressive episode and the HDRS scores in the depressed patients. Clinical correlates of these abnormal FCs should be cautiously interpreted due to the small sample size in this study. Abnormalities in the intrinsic organization may be an underlying basis for the pronounced and prolonged negative bias in processing emotional information observed in MDD. ",
pmid_15511655,Neural foundations of emerging route knowledge in complex spatial environments.,,"Behavioral evidence suggests that spatial knowledge derived from ground-level navigation can consist of both route and survey knowledge. Neuroimaging and lesion studies aiming to identify the neural structures responsible for topographical learning in humans have yielded partially inconsistent results, probably due to the lack of an effective behavioral parameter allowing for a reliable distinction between different representations. Therefore, we employed a novel virtual reality environment that provides accuracy and reaction time measures precisely indicating the emergence of route vs. survey knowledge. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to localize brain regions involved in the acquisition of pure route knowledge in the form of associations between consecutive landmark views and the direction of intermediate movements. Participants were scanned during repeated encoding of the complex environment from a first-person, ground-level perspective. Behavioral data revealed emerging route knowledge in 11 out of 14 subjects. Overall comparisons between encoding and control conditions identified activation in medial frontal gyrus, retrosplenial cortex and posterior inferior parietal cortex. Most importantly, only posterior inferior parietal regions showed increasing activation across sessions, thus paralleling behavioral measures of route expertise. Given the established role of the posterior parietal cortex in spatial processing, this area is thought to provide the pivotal spatial link between two landmarks encountered in immediate temporal succession.

pmid_22737995,Frontostriatal functional connectivity in major depressive disorder.,,"Abnormalities of the striatum and frontal cortex have been reported consistently in studies of neural structure and function in major depressive disorder (MDD). Despite speculation that compromised connectivity between these regions may underlie symptoms of MDD, little work has investigated the integrity of frontostriatal circuits in this disorder. Functional magnetic resonance images were acquired from 21 currently depressed and 19 never-disordered women during wakeful rest. Using four predefined striatal regions-of-interest, seed-to-whole brain correlations were computed and compared between groups. Compared to controls, depressed participants exhibited attenuated functional connectivity between the ventral striatum and both ventromedial prefrontal cortex and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. Depressed participants also exhibited stronger connectivity between the dorsal caudate and dorsal prefrontal cortex, which was positively correlated with severity of the disorder. Depressed individuals are characterized by aberrant connectivity in frontostriatal circuits that are posited to support affective and cognitive processing. Further research is required to examine more explicitly the link between patterns of disrupted connectivity and specific symptoms of depression, and the extent to which these patterns precede the onset of depression and normalize with recovery from depressive illness.

Subjects were scheduled for 3 functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning visits: an initial screening day (screening state), after a normal night of sleep (rested state), and after 30 hours of sleep deprivation (sleep-deprivation state). Subjects performed the Sternberg working memory task alternated with a control task during an approximate 13-minute functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Inpatient General Clinical Research Center and outpatient functional magnetic resonance imaging center. Results from 33 men (mean age, 28.6 +/- 6.6 years) were included in the final analyses. None. Subjects performed the same Sternberg working memory task at the 3 states within the magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Neuroimaging data revealed that, in the screening and rested states, the brain regions activated by the Sternberg working memory task were found in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, Broca's area, supplementary motor area, right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and the bilateral posterior parietal cortexes. After 30 hours of sleep deprivation, the activations in these brain regions significantly decreased, especially in the bilateral posterior parietal cortices. Task performance also decreased. A repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed that subjects at the screening and rested states had similar activation patterns, with each having significantly more activation than during the sleep-deprivation state. These results suggest that human sleep-deprivation deficits are not caused solely or even predominantly by prefrontal cortex dysfunction and that the paretal cortex, in particular, and other brain regions involved in verbal working memory exhibit significant sleep-deprivation vulnerability.

Accumulating evidence suggests an early and marked divergence in ASD from the typical developmental tuning of brain regions to process social information. In this review, we discuss a relatively recent yet substantial literature of behavioral and neuroimaging studies that consistently indicates impairments in biological motion perception in ASD. We then illustrate the fundamental disruption in this form of social perception in autism, drawing connections between a genetic liability to develop autism and disrupted associated brain mechanisms, as we describe neuroendophenotypes of autism derived from an fMRI study of biological motion perception in children with autism and their unaffected siblings. Finally, we demonstrate the diagnostic utility of brain responses to biological motion. With the ability to measure brain function in the first year of life comes the potential to chart the development of disrupted biological motion processing in ASD and to specify the gene-brain-behavior interactions shaping this atypical trajectory. We propose that a comprehensive understanding of the development of impaired responses to biological motion in ASD can inform future diagnosis and treatment approaches. ",

working memory","Several studies have suggested that addictive disorders including substance abuse and pathologic gambling might be associated with dysfunction on working memory and prefrontal activity. We hypothesized that excessive online game playing is associated with deficits in prefrontal cortex function and that recovery from excessive online game playing might improve prefrontal cortical activation in response to working memory stimulation. Thirteen adolescents with excessive online game playing (AEOP) and ten healthy adolescents (HC) agreed to participate in this study. The severity of online game play and playing time were evaluated for a baseline measurement and again following four weeks of treatment. Brain activation in response to working memory tasks (simple and complex calculations) at baseline and subsequent measurements was assessed using BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Compared to the HC subjects, the AEOP participants exhibited significantly greater activity in the right middle occipital gyrus, left cerebellum posterior lobe, left premotor cortex and left middle temporal gyrus in response to working memory tasks during baseline measurements. After four weeks of treatment, the AEOP subjects showed increased activity within the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left occipital fusiform gyrus. After four weeks of treatment, changes in the severity of online game playing were negatively correlated with changes in the mean β value of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in response to complex stimulation. We suggest that the effects of online game addiction on working memory may be similar to those observed in patients with substance dependence. ",
pmid_17406250,The Multi-Source Interference Task: an fMRI task that reliably activates the cingulo-frontal-parietal cognitive/attention network.,,"In this protocol we describe how to perform the Multi-Source Interference Task (MSIT), a validated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task that reliably and robustly activates the cingulo-frontal-parietal cognitive/attention network (CFP network) within individual subjects. The MSIT can be used to (i) identify the cognitive/attention network in normal volunteers and (ii) test its integrity in people with neuropsychiatric disorders. It is simple to perform, can be completed in less than 15 min and is not language specific, making it appropriate for children, adults and the elderly. Since its validation, over 100 adults have performed the task. The MSIT produces a robust and temporally stable reaction time interference effect (range 200-350 ms), and single runs of the MSIT have produced CFP network activation in approximately 95% of tested subjects. The robust, reliable and temporally stable neuroimaging and performance data make the MSIT a useful task with which to study normal human cognition and psychiatric pathophysiology. ",
pmid_16544328,Neural circuits subserving the retrieval of stems and grammatical features in regular and irregular verbs.,,"Many languages, including English and Spanish, feature regular (dance --> danced) and irregular (catch --> caught) inflectional systems. According to psycholinguistic theories, regular and irregular inflections are instantiated either by a single or by two specialized mechanisms. Those theories differ in their assumptions concerning the underlying information necessary for the processing of regular verbs. Whereas single mechanism accounts have stated an increased involvement of phonological processing for regular verbs, dual accounts emphasize the prominence of grammatical information. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we sought to delineate the brain areas involved in the generation of complex verb forms in Spanish. This language has the advantage of isolating specific differences in the regular-irregular contrasts in terms of the number of stems associated with a verb while controlling for compositionality (regular and irregular verbs apply suffixes to be inflected). The present study showed that areas related to grammatical processing are active for both types of verbs (left opercular inferior frontal gyrus). In addition, major differences between regular and irregular verbs were also observed. Several areas of the prefrontal cortex were selectively active for irregular production, presumably reflecting their role in lexical retrieval (bilateral inferior frontal area and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). Regular verbs, however, showed increased activation in areas related to grammatical processing (anterior superior temporal gyrus/insular cortex) and in the left hippocampus, the latter possibly related to a greater implication of the phonological loop necessary for the reutilization of the same stem shared across all forms in regular verbs.

pmid_21077137,Spatial patterns of intrinsic brain activity in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: a resting-state functional MRI study.,,"We used resting-state functional MRI to investigate spatial patterns of spontaneous brain activity in 22 healthy elderly subjects, as well as 16 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 16 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. The pattern of intrinsic brain activity was measured by examining the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of blood oxygen level dependent signal during rest. There were widespread ALFF differences among the three groups throughout the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices. Both AD and MCI patients showed decreased activity mainly in the medial parietal lobe region and lentiform nucleus, while there was increased activity in the lateral temporal regions and superior frontal and parietal regions as compared with controls. Compared with MCI, the AD patients showed decreased activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and increased activity in the superior frontal gyrus and inferior and superior temporal gyri. Specifically, the most significant ALFF differences among the groups appeared in the posterior cingulate cortex, with a reduced pattern of activity when comparing healthy controls, MCI, and AD patients. Additionally, we also showed that the regions with ALFF changes had significant correlations with the cognitive performance of patients as measured by mini-mental state examination scores. Finally, while taking gray matter volume as covariates, the ALFF results were approximately consistent with those without gray matter correction, implying that the functional analysis could not be explained by regional atrophy. Together, our results demonstrate that there is a specific pattern of ALFF in AD and MCI, thus providing insights into biological mechanisms of the diseases. ",
pmid_18485592,Impaired response inhibition function in abstinent heroin dependents: an fMRI study.,,"Heroin, like various illicit substances, has a negative impact on the frontal cognitive function after repeated abuse. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural substrates of response inhibition and competition in 18 healthy controls and assess the frontal neurocognition in 30 abstinent heroin dependents (AHD) as they performed a Go/NoGo Association task with reaction times recorded spontaneously. The neural response which was induced by response inhibition was prominent in the midline structure, specifically the bilateral medial prefrontal gyrus and anterior cingulated cortex, as well as the left middle frontal gyrus, insula, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus and limbic system. Unlike drug-naïve controls, only the bilateral superior frontal gyrus and left middle frontal gyrus were activated in AHD. Furthermore, the RT of AHD was significantly longer than that of controls. The results suggest that: (1) the ACC, mPFC and inferior frontal lobe play an important role in response inhibition and competition; (2) heroin dependents had an impaired response inhibition function that lasted even months into abstinence, which indicates that the negative effect of heroin on the inhibitory function still continues in early protracted withdrawal state.

obese/overweight","Growing researches have shown that obese/overweight and healthy weight individuals exhibit different neural responses to food-related stimuli. Accordingly, researchers proposed several theories to explain these differences. Hereon, meta-analyses were conducted using activation likelihood estimation (ALE) to verify these theories and specify the reason of overeating from two aspects. Pubmed, Web of Science and Neurosynth were searched for the current study and screened according to inclusion criteria. Firstly, neural responses to visual food cues versus non-food images were compared between obese/overweight and healthy weight individuals. Then, neural activation to high-calorie food images versus low-calorie food/non-food visual stimuli was further investigated among the two populations. Coordinates in included studies were recorded and analysed by Ginger ALE software under threshold at uncorrected p < 0.001 with cluster-level p < 0.05 (cFWE). Eleven and seven studies were found in the first and second set of meta-analysis, respectively. The first meta-analysis showed that obese/overweight have hyper-responsivity in reward area and hypo-responsivity in both gustatory processing and inhibitory control area. The second meta-analysis indicated that the reward responsivity in the obese/overweight individuals was amplified and healthy weight individuals had higher activation in areas associated with gustatory processing in response to high-calorie food images. Our results showed that the obese/overweight exhibit hyper-responsivity in brain regions involved in reward processing for visual food cue which provide strong support for incentive-sensitization theory of obesity and healthy weight individuals showed higher response in inhibitory control region which support the inhibitory control deficit theory of obesity.

pmid_29343693,Phantom Acupuncture Induces Placebo Credibility and Vicarious Sensations: A Parallel fMRI Study of Low Back Pain Patients.,,"Although acupuncture is an effective therapeutic intervention for pain reduction, the exact difference between real and sham acupuncture has not been clearly understood because a somatosensory tactile component is commonly included in the existing sham acupuncture protocols. In an event-related fMRI experiment, we implemented a novel form of sham acupuncture, phantom acupuncture, that reproduces the acupuncture needling procedure without somatosensory tactile stimulation while maintaining the credibility of the acupuncture treatment context. Fifty-six non-specific low back pain patients received either real (REAL) or phantom (PHNT) acupuncture stimulation in a parallel group study. The REAL group exhibited greater activation in the posterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex, reflecting the needling-specific components of acupuncture. We demonstrated that PHNT could be delivered credibly. Interestingly, the PHNT-credible group exhibited bilateral activation in SI/SII and also reported vicarious acupuncture sensations without needling stimulation. The PHNT group showed greater activation in the bilateral dorsolateral/ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC/vlPFC). Moreover, the PHNT group exhibited significant pain reduction, with a significant correlation between the subjective fMRI signal in the right dlPFC/vlPFC and a score assessing belief in acupuncture effectiveness. These results support an expectation-related placebo analgesic effect on subjective pain intensity ratings, possibly mediated by right prefrontal cortex activity. ",

Here, we investigate the mechanisms underlying this process and test a computational model of social value to predict collaborative decision making. Twenty-six participants played an iterated trust game and chose to invest more frequently with their friends compared with a confederate or computer despite equal reinforcement rates. This behavior was predicted by our model, which posits that people receive a social value reward signal from reciprocation of collaborative decisions conditional on the closeness of the relationship. This social value signal was associated with increased activity in the ventral striatum and medial prefrontal cortex, which significantly predicted the reward parameters from the social value model. Therefore, we demonstrate that the computation of social value drives collaborative behavior in repeated interactions and provide a mechanistic account of reward circuit function instantiating this process.

mindfulness, self
social anxiety disorder","This study examined the effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on the brain-behavior mechanisms of self-referential processing in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD). Sixteen patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while encoding self-referential, valence, and orthographic features of social trait adjectives. Post-MBSR, 14 patients completed neuroimaging. Compared to baseline, MBSR completers showed (a) increased self-esteem and decreased anxiety, (b) increased positive and decreased negative self-endorsement, (c) increased activity in a brain network related to attention regulation, and (d) reduced activity in brain systems implicated in conceptual-linguistic self-view. MBSR-related changes in maladaptive or distorted social self-view in adults diagnosed with SAD may be related to modulation of conceptual self-processing and attention regulation. Self-referential processing may serve as a functional biobehavioral target to measure the effects of mindfulness training. ",

infra-slow oscillations
periaqueductal gray matter
spinal trigeminal nucleus","The neural mechanism responsible for migraine remains unclear. While the role of an external trigger in migraine initiation remains vigorously debated, it is generally assumed that migraineurs display altered brain function between attacks. This idea stems from relatively few brain imaging studies with even fewer studies exploring changes in the 24 h period immediately prior to a migraine attack. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measured infra-slow oscillatory activity, regional homogeneity, and connectivity strengths of resting activity in migraineurs directly before (n = 8), after (n = 11), and between migraine attacks (n = 26) and in healthy control subjects (n = 78). Comparisons between controls and each migraine group and between migraine groups were made for each of these measures. Directly prior to a migraine, increased infra-slow oscillatory activity occurred in brainstem and hypothalamic regions that also display altered activity during a migraine itself, that is, the spinal trigeminal nucleus, dorsal pons, and hypothalamus. Furthermore, these midbrain and hypothalamic sites displayed increased connectivity strengths and regional homogeneity directly prior to a migraine. Remarkably, these resting oscillatory and connectivity changes did not occur directly after or between migraine attacks and were significantly different to control subjects. These data provide evidence of altered brainstem and hypothalamic function in the period immediately before a migraine and raise the prospect that such changes contribute to the expression of a migraine attack.

pmid_22498079,Food motivation circuitry hypoactivation related to hedonic and nonhedonic aspects of hunger and satiety in women with active anorexia nervosa and weight-restored women with anorexia nervosa.,,"Previous studies have provided evidence of food motivation circuitry dysfunction in individuals with anorexia nervosa. However, methodological limitations present challenges to the development of a cohesive neurobiological model of anorexia nervosa. Our goal was to investigate the neural circuitry of appetite dysregulation across states of hunger and satiety in active and weight-restored phases of anorexia nervosa using robust methodology to advance our understanding of potential neural circuitry abnormalities related to hedonic and nonhedonic state and trait. We scanned women with active anorexia nervosa, weight-restored women with anorexia nervosa and healthy-weight controls on a 3-T Siemens magnetic resonance scanner while they viewed images of high- and low-calorie foods and objects before (premeal) and after (postmeal) eating a 400 kcal meal. We enrolled 12 women with active disease, 10 weight-restored women with anorexia nervosa and 11 controls in our study. Compared with controls, both weight-restored women and those with active disease demonstrated hypoactivity premeal in the hypothalamus, amygdala and anterior insula in response to high-calorie foods (v. objects). Postmeal, hypoactivation in the anterior insula persisted in women with active disease. Percent signal change in the anterior insula was positively correlated with food stimuli ratings and hedonic and nonhedonic appetite ratings in controls, but not women with active disease. Our findings are limited by a relatively small sample size, which prevented the use of an analysis of variance model and exploration of interaction effects, although our substantial effect sizes of between-group differences suggest adequate power for our statistical analysis approach. Participants taking psychotropic medications were included. Our data provide evidence of potential state and trait hypoactivations in food motivation regions involved in the assessment of food's reward value and integration of these with interoceptive signalling of one's internal state of well-being, with important relations between brain activity and homeostatic and hedonic aspects of appetite. Our findings give novel evidence of disruption in neurobiological circuits and stress the importance of examining both state and trait characteristics in the investigation of brain phenotypes in individuals with anorexia nervosa.

Resting-state functional connectivity
Schizophrenia
Structural-functional relationship","Altered resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) has been demonstrated between multiple brain regions in schizophrenia. However, whether these alterations are related to fractional anisotropy (FA) alterations in pathways that connect regions with altered rsFC remains unknown. In this study, diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging were performed with 181 antipsychotic-naïve first-episode schizophrenia patients and 173 matched healthy controls. FA was measured using tensor-guided tractography in identifiable pathways between selected pairs of brain regions with altered rsFC as determined by prior meta-analysis. Compared with controls, patients showed significantly decreased FA between right caudate nucleus and right pallidum, right caudate nucleus and right putamen, and right hippocampus and right thalamus. Decreased rsFC was observed between right pallidum and right thalamus, and right insula and right superior temporal gyrus. No significant correlation was observed between FA and rsFC. FA between right caudate nucleus and right putamen was inversely correlated with negative symptoms while rsFC between right pallidum and right thalamus was inversely correlated with positive symptoms. The lack of robust correlations between FA and rsFC and no overlap of these abnormalities indicate that regional rsFC alterations in the early course of schizophrenia are not primarily associated with FA alterations. The observation that positive and negative symptoms are related to different functional and structural disturbances is consistent with this dissociation, and with prior work suggests that different pathophysiological mechanism may underlie positive and negative symptoms in the early course of schizophrenia.

pmid_17160459,Brief report: recognition of emotional and non-emotional biological motion in individuals with autistic spectrum disorders.,,"This study aimed to explore the perception of different components of biological movement in individuals with autism and Asperger syndrome. The ability to recognize a person's actions, subjective states, emotions, and objects conveyed by moving point-light displays was assessed in 19 participants with autism and 19 comparable typical control participants. Results showed that the participants with autism were as able as controls to name point-light displays of non-human objects and human actions. In contrast, they were significantly poorer at labeling emotional displays, suggesting that they are specifically impaired in attending to emotional states. Most studies have highlighted an emotional deficit in facial expression perception; our results extend this hypothesized deficit to the perception and interpretation of whole-body biological movements.

pmid_23201363,Multimodal imaging reveals the spatiotemporal dynamics of recollection.,,"Functional MRI research suggests that different frontal and parietal cortical regions support strategic processes that are engaged at different stages of recollection, from pre-retrieval processing of a cue to post-retrieval maintenance and evaluation of recollected information. Whereas some of these regions respond in a domain-general way, other regions are sensitive to the type of information being recollected. However, the low temporal resolution of fMRI cannot distinguish component processes at the time-scale at which recollection occurs. We therefore combined fMRI with the excellent temporal resolution of source localised EEG/MEG to investigate the spatiotemporal neural dynamics of recollection. fMRI and EEG/MEG data were collected from the same participants in two sessions while they retrieved different types of episodic information. This multimodal imaging approach revealed striking consistency between the regions identified with fMRI and EEG/MEG, providing novel evidence of how these brain areas interact over time to support source recollection. For domain-general recollection, results from both modalities converged in showing the strongest activations in medial parietal cortex, which according to EEG/MEG was reliable at a late retrieval stage. Domain-specific source recollection increased fMRI and EEG/MEG activation in the left lateral prefrontal cortex, which EEG/MEG indicated also to be recruited during a post-recollection stage. The findings suggest that although medial parietal and left lateral prefrontal regions mediate functionally different retrieval processes, they are both engaged at a late stage of episodic retrieval.

pmid_20537612,Affect regulation and pain in borderline personality disorder: a possible link to the understanding of self-injury.,,"Patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) experience intense emotions and often show a deficiency of emotion regulation skills. Moreover, they display high prevalence rates of self-injurious behavior. Patients report engaging in self-injurious behavior due to its immediate relief effects of emotional tension. Pain in BPD has further been observed to lead to a reduction in neural activity in the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex, which may be attributed to patients' perception of relaxation. To investigate the potential role of self-inflicted pain as a means of affect regulation in patients with BPD, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging study using picture stimuli to induce negative (vs. neutral) affect and thermal stimuli to induce heat pain (vs. warmth perception). The painful heat stimuli were administrated at an individual temperature for each subject. Twenty patients with BPD and 23 healthy control subjects were included in the study. Both negative and neutral pictures led to stronger activation of the amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex in patients with BPD than in healthy control subjects. Amygdala activation correlated with self-reported deficits in emotion regulation. During the sensory stimulation, we found decreased amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex activation, which was independent of painfulness. The results are in line with previous findings on emotional hyperactivity in BPD and suggest that pain stimuli in BPD are processed differently depending on the arousal status. Finally, we can preliminarily support the idea of a general mechanism of attentional shift underlying the soothing effect of pain in BPD. ",

Unaffected sibling","Several resting-state neuroimaging studies in schizophrenia indicate an excessive brain activity while others report an incoherent brain activity at rest. No direct evidence for the simultaneous presence of both excessive and incoherent brain activity has been established to date. Moreover, it is unclear whether unaffected siblings of schizophrenia patients who share half of the affected patient's genotype also exhibit the excessive and incoherent brain activity that may render them vulnerable to the development of schizophrenia. 27 pairs of schizophrenia patients and their unaffected siblings, as well as 27 healthy controls, were scanned using gradient-echo echo-planar imaging at rest. By using amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (Reho), we investigated the intensity and synchronization of local spontaneous neuronal activity in three groups. We observed that increased amplitude and reduced synchronization (coherence) of spontaneous neuronal activity were shared by patients and their unaffected siblings. The key brain regions with this abnormal neural pattern in both patients and siblings included the middle temporal, orbito-frontal, inferior occipital and fronto-insular gyrus. This abnormal neural pattern of excessive and incoherent neuronal activity shared by schizophrenia patients and their healthy siblings may improve our understanding of neuropathology and genetic predisposition in schizophrenia.

pmid_26064166,The Effects of Acupuncture at Real or Sham Acupoints on the Intrinsic Brain Activity in Mild Cognitive Impairment Patients.,,"Accumulating neuroimaging studies in humans have shown that acupuncture can modulate a widely distributed brain network in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Acupuncture at different acupoints could exert different modulatory effects on the brain network. However, whether acupuncture at real or sham acupoints can produce different effects on the brain network in MCI or AD patients remains unclear. Using resting-state fMRI, we reported that acupuncture at Taixi (KI3) induced amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) change of different brain regions in MCI patients from those shown in the healthy controls. In MCI patients, acupuncture at KI3 increased or decreased ALFF in the different regions from those activated by acupuncture in the healthy controls. Acupuncture at the sham acupoint in MCI patients activated the different brain regions from those in healthy controls. Therefore, we concluded that acupuncture displays more significant effect on neuronal activities of the above brain regions in MCI patients than that in healthy controls. Acupuncture at KI3 exhibits different effects on the neuronal activities of the brain regions from acupuncture at sham acupoint, although the difference is only shown at several regions due to the close distance between the above points.

pmid_23137946,Nonconscious emotional processing involves distinct neural pathways for pictures and videos.,,"Facial expressions are known to impact observers' behavior, even when they are not consciously identifiable. Relying on visual crowding, a perceptual phenomenon whereby peripheral faces become undiscriminable, we show that participants exposed to happy vs. neutral crowded faces rated the pleasantness of subsequent neutral targets accordingly to the facial expression's valence. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) along with psychophysiological interaction analysis, we investigated the neural determinants of this nonconscious preference bias, either induced by static (i.e., pictures) or dynamic (i.e., videos) facial expressions. We found that while static expressions activated primarily the ventral visual pathway (including task-related functional connectivity between the fusiform face area and the amygdala), dynamic expressions triggered the dorsal visual pathway (i.e., posterior partietal cortex) and the substantia innominata, a structure that is contiguous with the dorsal amygdala. As temporal cues are known to improve the processing of visible facial expressions, the absence of ventral activation we observed with crowded videos questions the capacity to integrate facial features and facial motions without awareness. Nevertheless, both static and dynamic facial expressions activated the hippocampus and the orbitofrontal cortex, suggesting that nonconscious preference judgments may arise from the evaluation of emotional context and the computation of aesthetic evaluation.

The findings from 16 resting-state fMRI studies on MD are tabulated. Some common findings are discussed in further detail. The use of resting-state fMRI in MD research has yielded a number of significant findings that provide the basis for understanding the pathophysiology of depressive symptoms. Of particular note and deserving of further research are the roles of the cortico-limbic mood regulating circuit (MRC) and the interaction between task-positive and task-negative networks in MD. There is increasing interest in the use of resting-state fMRI in the study of psychiatric conditions, and continued improvement in technique and methodology will prove valuable in future research.

pmid_22682905,Neuronal effects following working memory training.,,"There is accumulating evidence that training working memory (WM) leads to beneficial effects in tasks that were not trained, but the mechanisms underlying this transfer remain elusive. Brain imaging can be a valuable method to gain insights into such mechanisms. Here, we discuss the impact of cognitive training on neural correlates with an emphasis on studies that implemented a WM intervention. We focus on changes in activation patterns, changes in resting state connectivity, changes in brain structure, and changes in the dopaminergic system. Our analysis of the existing literature reveals that there is currently no clear pattern of results that would single out a specific neural mechanism underlying training and transfer. We conclude that although brain imaging has provided us with information about the mechanisms of WM training, more research is needed to understand its neural impact. ",
pmid_18296070,"Specialisation in Broca's region for semantic, phonological, and syntactic fluency?",,"The literature suggests that that semantic and phonological fluency tasks selectively activate left Brodmann's area (BA) 45 and 44, respectively, in Broca's speech region. We used functional MRI to test this hypothesis. Subjects performed a semantic and a phonological fluency task. In addition, a syntactic fluency task (e.g. ""Generate nouns with masculine gender"") was included. Resting blocks were included as a low-level control condition. The exact localisation of the effects was tested with cytoarchitectonic probability maps of BA 44 and BA 45. Participants generated fewer words in the syntactic than in both the semantic and the phonological condition, which did not differ from each other. Compared to rest, all language tasks activated the well-known language network in the left hemisphere including both left BA 44 and BA 45. In the direct contrasts between the different verbal fluency tasks, phonological fluency activated BA 44 more strongly than semantic or syntactic fluency. However, semantic fluency did not elicit higher activation than the phonological fluency tasks in any part of Broca's region. No differences were observed between syntactic and semantic fluency. Thus, the activation in BA 45 observed during verbal fluency tasks seems to be not restricted to semantic processing as suggested by the literature. In contrast, phonological verbal fluency additionally involved the left BA 44. In conclusion, different parts of Broca's region support task-specific and more general processes in verbal fluency. ",
pmid_19173228,Neural bases of autobiographical support for episodic recollection of faces.,,"Incidental retrieval of autobiographical knowledge can provide rich contextual support for episodic recollection of a recent event. We examined the neural bases of these two processes by performing fMRI scanning during a recognition memory test for faces that were unfamiliar, famous, or personally known. The presence of pre-experimental knowledge of a face was incidental to the task, but nonetheless resulted in improved performance. Two distinct networks of activation were associated with correct recollection of a face's prior presentation (recollection hits vs. correct rejections) on one hand, and with pre-experimental knowledge about it (famous or personally known vs. unfamiliar faces) on the other. The former included mid/posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and ventral striatum. The latter included bilateral hippocampus, retrosplenial, and ventromedial prefrontal cortices. Anterior and medial thalamic activations showed an interaction between both effects, driven by increased activation for recollection of unfamiliar faces. When recollecting the presentation of a famous or personally known face, hippocampal activation increased with participants' ratings of how well they felt they knew the person shown. Ventromedial prefrontal cortex showed significantly greater activation for personally known than famous faces. Our results indicate a dissociation between the involvement of retrosplenial vs. mid/posterior cingulate and precuneus in memory tasks. They also indicate that, during recognition memory experiments, the hippocampus supports incidental retrieval of pre-experimental knowledge about the stimuli presented. This type of knowledge likely underlies the additional recollection found for prior presentation of well known stimuli compared with novel ones and may link hippocampal activation at encoding to subsequent memory performance more generally.

pmid_22178355,Reduced grey matter in the posterior insula as a structural vulnerability or diathesis to addiction.,,"A number of neuroimaging studies have shown that drug addiction is associated with morphological differences in several brain areas, including orbito-frontal and limbic structures. Most of these studies have investigated patients with addiction to cocaine. The neurobiological mechanisms which play a role in drug addiction are not fully understood, however, and the causal factors remain under investigation. The present study investigated morphological differences between patients with history of cocaine (N=14) and heroin (N=24) abuse and healthy matched controls (N=24). A 3D T1W MRI scan was acquired for all participants and the grey matter images of each patient group compared with those of controls. A direct comparison of the two addiction groups was also carried out. When compared with controls cocaine dependent patients had lower grey matter values in the left middle occipital gyrus, right putamen and insula, whereas heroin abusers had lower grey matter values in the right insula. The direct comparison between the two addiction groups showed that cocaine abusers had less grey matter in the right posterior cingulate, medio-temporal and cerebellar regions, whereas heroin abusers showed less grey matter in parietal regions on both sides, including postcentral gyrus and inferior parietal lobule. Reduced right posterior insular cortex was commonly found in both cocaine and heroin dependent patients. This morphological difference might represent a structural marker of addiction, which is independent of the discrete regional effects of each psychotropic substance of abuse, and might constitute a possible neurobiological vulnerability or diathesis to addiction. Equally, the discrete structural differences emerging from the direct comparison of cocaine and heroin abusers might reflect the effects of differential drug binding in the brain and/or express a form of neurobiological vulnerability which might explain individual drug choice.

To further investigate its regulation, we studied the effects of glucose versus water ingestion on the neural processing of visual high and low caloric food cues in 12 lean and 12 overweight subjects by functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found body weight to substantially impact the brain's response to visual food cues after glucose versus water ingestion. Specifically, there was a significant interaction between body weight, condition (water versus glucose), and caloric content of food cues. Although overweight subjects showed a generalized reduced response to food objects in the fusiform gyrus and precuneus, the lean group showed a differential pattern to high versus low caloric foods depending on glucose versus water ingestion. Furthermore, we observed plasma insulin and glucose associated effects. The hypothalamic response to high caloric food cues negatively correlated with changes in blood glucose 30 min after glucose ingestion, while especially brain regions in the prefrontal cortex showed a significant negative relationship with increases in plasma insulin 120 min after glucose ingestion. We conclude that the postprandial neural processing of food cues is highly influenced by body weight especially in visual areas, potentially altering visual attention to food. Furthermore, our results underline that insulin markedly influences prefrontal activity to high caloric food cues after a meal, indicating that postprandial hormones may be potential players in modulating executive control.

According to pharmacological studies, the endogenous opioid system is essential for placebo analgesia. Recent functional imaging data provides evidence that the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) represents a crucial cortical area for this type of endogenous pain control. We therefore hypothesized that placebo analgesia recruits other brain areas outside the rACC and that interactions of the rACC with these brain areas mediate opioid-dependent endogenous antinociception as part of a top-down mechanism. Nineteen healthy subjects received and rated painful laser stimuli to the dorsum of both hands, one of them treated with a fake analgesic cream (placebo). Painful stimulation was preceded by an auditory cue, indicating the side of the next laser stimulation. BOLD-responses to the painful laser-stimulation during the placebo and no-placebo condition were assessed using event-related fMRI. After having confirmed placebo related activity in the rACC, a connectivity analysis identified placebo dependent contributions of rACC activity with bilateral amygdalae and the periaqueductal gray (PAG). This finding supports the view that placebo analgesia depends on the enhanced functional connectivity of the rACC with subcortical brain structures that are crucial for conditioned learning and descending inhibition of nociception.

stress","Major depression has been repeatedly associated with amygdala hyper-responsiveness to negative (but not positive) facial expressions at early, automatic stages of emotion processing using subliminally presented stimuli. However, it is not clear whether this ""limbic bias"" is a correlate of depression or represents a vulnerability marker preceding the onset of the disease. Because childhood maltreatment is a potent risk factor for the development of major depression in later life, we explored whether childhood maltreatment is associated with amygdalar emotion processing bias in maltreated but healthy subjects. Amygdala responsiveness to subliminally presented sad and happy faces was measured by means of fMRI at 3 T in N = 150 healthy subjects carefully screened for psychiatric disorders. Childhood maltreatment was assessed by the 25-item childhood trauma questionnaire (CTQ). A strong association of CTQ-scores with amygdala responsiveness to sad, but not happy facial expressions emerged. This result was further qualified by an interaction of emotional valence and CTQ-scores and was not confounded by trait anxiety, current depression level, age, gender, intelligence, education level, and more recent stressful life-events. Childhood maltreatment is apparently associated with detectable changes in amygdala function during early stages of emotion processing which resemble findings described in major depression. Limbic hyper-responsiveness to negative facial cues could be a consequence of the experience of maltreatment during childhood increasing the risk of depression in later life. the present association of limbic bias and maltreatment was demonstrated in the absence of psychopathological abnormalities, thereby limiting strong conclusions.

pmid_15120536,"Neural responses to morphological, syntactic, and semantic properties of single words: an fMRI study.",,"Dissociations in the recognition of specific classes of words have been documented in brain-injured populations. These include deficits in the recognition and production of morphologically complex words as well as impairments specific to particular syntactic classes such as verbs. However, functional imaging evidence for distinctions among the neural systems underlying these dissociations has been inconclusive. We explored the neural systems involved in processing different word classes in a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging study, contrasting four groups of words co-varying morphological complexity (simple, monomorphemic words vs complex derived or inflected words) and syntactic class (verbs vs nouns/adjectives). Subtraction of word from letter string processing showed activation in left frontal and temporal lobe regions consistent with prior studies of visual word processing. No differences were observed for morphologically complex and simple words, despite adequate power to detect stimulus specific effects. A region of posterior left middle temporal gyrus showed significantly increased activation for verbs. Post hoc analyses showed that this elevated activation could also be related to semantic properties of the stimulus items (verbs have stronger action associations than nouns, and action association is correlated with activation). Results suggest that semantic as well as syntactic factors should be considered when assessing the neural systems involved in single word comprehension. ",
pmid_22153731,The association between Internet addiction and psychiatric disorder: a review of the literature.,,"Internet addiction is a newly emergent disorder. It has been found to be associated with a variety of psychiatric disorders. Information about such coexisting psychiatric disorders is essential to understand the mechanism of Internet addiction. In this review, we have recruited articles mentioning coexisting psychiatric disorders of Internet addiction from the PubMed database as at November 3, 2009. We describe the updated results for such disorders of Internet addiction, which include substance use disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, hostility, and social anxiety disorder. We also provide discussion for possible mechanisms accounting for the coexistence of psychiatric disorders and Internet addiction. The review might suggest that combined psychiatric disorders mentioned above should be evaluated and treated to prevent their deteriorating effect on the prognosis of Internet addiction. On the other hand, Internet addiction should be paid more attention to when treating people with these coexisting psychiatric disorders of Internet addiction. Additionally, we also suggest future necessary research directions that could provide further important information for the understanding of this issue. ",

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
Subtypes","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a clinically heterogeneous condition. To better understand and treat patients, symptomatology of OCD has been categorized into more homogenous symptom dimensions. The autogenous-reactive classification model has proven helpful in the elucidation of the neurobiological substrates for clinical heterogeneity in OCD. The purpose of the current study was to systematically compare regional and network functional alterations between OCD subtypes based on the autogenous-reactive model. Autogenous-type OCD patients (OCD-AO, n = 40), reactive-type patients (OCD-RO, n = 42), and healthy controls (HC, n = 70) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) were compared among subjects. Areas of abnormal local spontaneous brain activity that differentiated OCD-AO and OCD-RO patients were identified and entered as seeds in functional connectivity (FC) analysis. Compared to OCD-RO patients and HC participants, OCD-AO patients showed increased ALFF in the left anterior insula (AI), increased ReHo in the right AI, and hyperconnectivity between bilateral AI and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Both OCD-AO and OCD-RO patients shared regional function deficits in several areas within the prefrontal cortex, and stronger FC between bilateral AI and major nodes of the default mode network (DMN) compared to healthy controls. The current results suggest that aberrant functional interaction between the salience network (SN) and the DMN may represent a common substrate in the pathophysiology of OCD, while impaired functional coupling within the SN is distinct to autogenous-type OCD patients. These findings provide further neurobiological evidence to support the autogenous-reactive classification model and contribute to the understanding of the neurobiological basis for clinical heterogeneity in OCD.

The present study compared high-functioning (HFA) and low-functioning (LFA) children with typically developing children (TDC) on their executive functions as measured by the Hong Kong List Learning Test, D2 Test of Concentration, Five Point Test, Children's Color Trail Test, Tower of California Test, and Go/No-Go task and neural connectivity as measured by theta coherence in the distributed fronto-parietal network. Thirty-eight children with ASD (19 HFA and 19 LFA) and 28 TDC children, aged 8-17 years, participated voluntarily in the study. The results on executive function showed that the LFA group demonstrated the poorest performance as exhibited by their Executive Composite and individual executive function scores, while the TDC group exhibited the highest. These results have extended the findings of previous studies in demonstrating that HFA and LFA children have significant differences in their degree of executive function deficits. The results on neural connectivity also showed that children with ASD demonstrated a different pattern of electroencephalography (EEG) coherence from TDC children, as demonstrated by the significantly elevated theta coherence in the fronto-parietal network, and that the severity of executive dysfunction between high- and low-functioning children with ASD was found to be associated with the disordered neural connectivity in these children.

pmid_29668391,The Reflective Mind: Examining Individual Differences in Susceptibility to Base Rate Neglect with fMRI.,,"Performance on heuristics and bias tasks has been shown to be susceptible to bias. In turn, susceptibility to bias varies as a function of individual differences in cognitive abilities (e.g., intelligence) and thinking styles (e.g., propensity for reflection). Using a classic task (i.e., lawyer-engineer problem), we conducted two experiments to examine the differential contributions of cognitive abilities versus thinking styles to performance. The results of Experiment 1 demonstrated that the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT)-a well-established measure of reflective thinking-predicted performance on conflict problems (where base rates and intuition point in opposite directions), whereas STM predicted performance on nonconflict problems. Experiment 2 conducted in the fMRI scanner replicated this behavioral dissociation and enabled us to probe their neural correlates. As predicted, conflict problems were associated with greater activation in the ACC-a key region for conflict detection-even in cases when participants responded stereotypically. In participants with higher CRT scores, conflict problems were associated with greater activation in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and activation in PCC covaried in relation to CRT scores during conflict problems. Also, CRT scores predicted activation in PCC in conflict problems (over and above nonconflict problems). Our results suggest that individual differences in reflective thinking as measured by CRT are related to brain activation in PCC-a region involved in regulating attention between external and internal foci. We discuss the implications of our findings in terms of PCC's possible involvement in switching from intuitive to analytic mode of thought. ",
pmid_15808999,Dissociable brain activations during the retrieval of different kinds of spatial context memory.,,"Although memory for spatial information has often been regarded as unitary, it may be divided into two distinct types: memory for the place where an individual experienced an event and memory for the location of an experienced event within a specific reference object. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to elucidate the distinctions between the retrieval of these two types of spatial context memory. During scanning, subjects judged the room (Place task) in which a photograph had been presented or the location of the photograph on the computer display (R-L task) during the encoding phase. In a control task, subjects were asked to judge whether the photograph had been presented or not. The left middle frontal gyrus, lateral parietal and occipital regions, and bilateral precunei were found to be active during both the Place task and the R-L task compared with the control task. Critically, the place task, compared with the R-L task, was associated with activations in the right lateral prefrontal gyri, the posterior part of the left parahippocampal gyrus, bilateral retrosplenial and lateral parieto-occipital areas, whereas the R-L task, relative to the place task, with activation only in the right lateral parietal cortex. These findings indicate that the retrieval processes of spatial context memory are not associated with a single network, but may vary and recruit different neural networks depending on the type of spatial information to be retrieved.

However, the neural basis of this impairment has not previously been investigated. Furthermore, despite high comorbidity of psychopathic traits and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, to our knowledge, no research has attempted to distinguish neural correlates of childhood psychopathic traits and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. To determine the neural regions that underlie the reversal learning impairments in children with psychopathic traits plus conduct or oppositional defiant disorder. Case-control study. Government clinical research institute. Forty-two adolescents aged 10 to 17 years: 14 with psychopathic traits and oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder, 14 with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder only, and 14 healthy controls. Blood oxygenation level-dependent signal as measured via functional magnetic resonance imaging during a probabilistic reversal task. Children with psychopathic traits showed abnormal responses within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 10) during punished reversal errors compared with children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and healthy children (P < .05 corrected for multiple comparisons). To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence of abnormal ventromedial prefrontal cortex responsiveness in children with psychopathic traits and demonstrates this dysfunction was not attributable to comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. These findings suggest that reversal learning impairments in patients with developmental psychopathic traits relate to abnormal processing of reinforcement information. ",
pmid_17067740,Brain activity for spontaneous pain of postherpetic neuralgia and its modulation by lidocaine patch therapy.,,"Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a debilitating chronic pain condition, yet there is a lack of knowledge regarding underlying brain activity. Here we identify brain regions involved in spontaneous pain of PHN (n=11) and determine its modulation with Lidoderm therapy (patches of 5% lidocaine applied to the PHN affected body part). Continuous ratings of fluctuations of spontaneous pain during fMRI were contrasted to ratings of fluctuations of a bar observed during scanning, at three sessions: (1) pre-treatment baseline, (2) after 6h of Lidoderm treatment, and (3) after 2 weeks of Lidoderm use. Overall brain activity for spontaneous pain of PHN involved affective and sensory-discriminative areas: thalamus, primary and secondary somatosensory, insula and anterior cingulate cortices, as well as areas involved in emotion, hedonics, reward, and punishment: ventral striatum, amygdala, orbital frontal cortex, and ventral tegmental area. Generally, these activations decreased at sessions 2 and 3, except right anterior insular activity which increased with treatment. The sensory and affective activations only responded to the short-term treatment (6h of Lidoderm); while the ventral striatum and amygdala (reward-related regions) decreased mainly with longer-term treatment (2 weeks of Lidoderm). Pain properties: average magnitude of spontaneous pain, and responses on Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS), decreased with treatment. The ventral striatal and amygdala activity best reflected changes in NPS, which was modulated only with longer-term treatment. The results show a specific brain activity pattern for PHN spontaneous pain, and implicate areas involved in emotions and reward as best reflecting changes in pain with treatment. ",
pmid_16407533,Brain activity associated with expectancy-enhanced placebo analgesia as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging.,,"In this study, a well established expectancy manipulation model was combined with a novel placebo intervention, a validated sham acupuncture needle, to investigate the brain network involved in placebo analgesia. Sixteen subjects completed the experiment. We found that after placebo acupuncture treatment, subjective pain rating reduction (pre minus post) on the placebo-treated side was significantly greater than on the control side. When we calculated the contrast that subtracts the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal difference between post-treatment and pretreatment during pain application on placebo side from the same difference on control side [e.g., placebo (post - pre) - control (post - pre)], significant differences were observed in the bilateral rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), lateral prefrontal cortex, right anterior insula, supramarginal gyrus, and left inferior parietal lobule. The simple regression (correlation) analysis between each subject's fMRI signal difference of post-treatment and pretreatment difference on placebo and control side and the corresponding subjective pain rating difference showed that significant negative correlation was observed in the bilateral lateral/orbital prefrontal cortex, rACC, cerebellum, right fusiform, parahippocampus, and pons. These results are different from a previous study that found decreased activity in pain-sensitive regions such as the thalamus, insula, and ACC when comparing the response to noxious stimuli applied to control and placebo cream-treated areas of the skin. Our results suggest that placebo analgesia may be configured through multiple brain pathways and mechanisms. ",
pmid_20021629,Resting state default-mode network connectivity in early depression using a seed region-of-interest analysis: decreased connectivity with caudate nucleus.,,"Reports on resting brain activity in healthy controls have described a default-mode network (DMN) and important differences in DMN connectivity have emerged for several psychiatric conditions. No study to date, however, has investigated resting-state DMN in relatively early depression before years of medication treatment. The objective of the present study was, therefore, to investigate the DMN in patients seeking help from specialized mental health services for the first time for symptoms of depression. Fourteen depressed subjects and 15 matched controls were scanned using 4-T functional magnetic resonance imaging while resting with eyes closed. All but one subject was medication free. A precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (P/PCC) seed-region connectivity analysis was used to identify the DMN and compare study groups in regions of relevance to depression. The P/PCC analysis identified the DMN well in both study groups, consistent with prior literature. Direct comparison showed significantly reduced correlation between the P/PCC and the bilateral caudate in depression compared with controls and no areas of increased connectivity in the depressed group. The present study is the first to investigate resting-state DMN in the early stages of treatment-seeking for depression. Depressed subjects had decreased connectivity between the P/PCC and the bilateral caudate, regions known to be involved in motivation and reward processing. Deficits in DMN connectivity with the caudate may be an early manifestation of major depressive disorder. ",
pmid_20426883,Reduced neural response to reward following 7 days treatment with the cannabinoid CB1 antagonist rimonabant in healthy volunteers.,,"Reduced subjective experience of reward (anhedonia) is a key symptom of major depression. The anti-obesity drug and cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB(1)) antagonist, rimonabant, is associated with significant rates of depression and anxiety in clinical use and was recently withdrawn from the market because of these adverse effects. Using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) model of reward we hypothesized that rimonabant would impair reward processing. Twenty-two healthy participants were randomly allocated to receive rimonabant (20 mg), or placebo, for 7 d in a double-blind, parallel group design. We used fMRI to measure the neural response to rewarding (sight and/or flavour of chocolate) and aversive (sight of mouldy strawberries and/or an unpleasant strawberry taste) stimuli on the final day of drug treatment. Rimonabant reduced the neural response to chocolate stimuli in key reward areas such as the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex. Rimonabant also decreased neural responses to the aversive stimulus condition in the caudate nucleus and ventral striatum, but increased lateral orbitofrontal activations to the aversive sight and taste of strawberry condition. Our findings are the first to show that the anti-obesity drug rimonabant inhibits the neural processing of rewarding food stimuli in humans. This plausibly underlies its ability to promote weight loss, but may also indicate a mechanism for inducing anhedonia which could lead to the increased risk of depressive symptomatology seen in clinical use. fMRI may be a useful method of screening novel agents for unwanted effects on reward and associated clinical adverse reactions.

inferior parietal lobule","Facial expressions convey important emotional and social information and are frequently applied in investigations of human affective processing. Dynamic faces may provide higher ecological validity to examine perceptual and cognitive processing of facial expressions. Higher order processing of emotional faces was addressed by varying the task and virtual face models systematically. Blood oxygenation level-dependent activation was assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging in 20 healthy volunteers while viewing and evaluating either emotion or gender intensity of dynamic face stimuli. A general linear model analysis revealed that high valence activated a network of motion-responsive areas, indicating that visual motion areas support perceptual coding for the motion-based intensity of facial expressions. The comparison of emotion with gender discrimination task revealed increased activation of inferior parietal lobule, which highlights the involvement of parietal areas in processing of high level features of faces. Dynamic emotional stimuli may help to emphasize functions of the hypothesized 'extended' over the 'core' system for face processing. ",

Voxel-based morphometry","Characterizing brain maturation in adolescents with disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs) may provide insight into the progression of their behavioral deficits. Therefore, this study examined how age and executive functioning were related to structural neural characteristics in DBD. Thirty-three individuals (aged 13-17) with a DBD, along with a matched control sample, completed neuropsychological testing and underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure gray matter volume and microstructural white matter properties. Voxel-based morphometry quantified gray matter volume, and diffusion tensor imaging measured fractional anisotropy (FA) in white matter tracts. In the anterior cingulate, gray matter volume decreased with age in healthy controls but showed no such change in the DBD sample. In the corpus callosum and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), FA increased with age in the control sample significantly more than in the DBD sample. Executive functioning, particularly working memory, was associated with SLF FA bilaterally. However, the relationship of SLF FA to working memory performance was weaker in the DBD sample. These data suggest that youth with DBD have altered brain development compared with typically developing youth. The abnormal maturation of the anterior cingulate and frontoparietal tracts during adolescence may contribute to the persistence of behavioral deficits in teens with a DBD. ",

Females with and without full/subthreshold bulimia nervosa recruited from the community (N = 26) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during receipt and anticipated receipt of chocolate milkshake and a tasteless control solution. Women with bulimia nervosa showed trends for less activation than healthy controls in the right anterior insula in response to anticipated receipt of chocolate milkshake (vs. tasteless solution) and in the left middle frontal gyrus, right posterior insula, right precentral gyrus, and right mid dorsal insula in response to consumptions of milkshake (vs. tasteless solution). Bulimia nervosa may be related to potential hypofunctioning of the brain reward system, which may lead these individuals to binge eat to compensate for this reward deficit, though the hypo-responsivity might be a result of a history of binge eating highly palatable foods.

In a previous paper, our group showed that several brain regions involved in emotional processing, such as the parahippocampal gyrus and other regions, were less activated in pre-treatment somatoform disorder patients (compared to healthy controls) during an empathy task. Since the parahippocampal gyrus is involved in emotional memory, its decreased activation might reflect the repression of emotional memories (which-according to psychoanalytical concepts-plays an important role in somatoform disorder). Psychodynamic psychotherapy aims at increasing the understanding of emotional conflicts as well as uncovering repressed emotions. We were interested, whether brain activity in the parahippocampal gyrus normalized after (inpatient) multimodal psychodynamic psychotherapy. Using fMRI, subjects were scanned while they shared the emotional states of presented facial stimuli expressing anger, disgust, joy, and a neutral expression; distorted stimuli with unrecognizable content served as control condition. 15 somatoform disorder patients were scanned twice, pre and post multimodal psychodynamic psychotherapy; in addition, 15 age-matched healthy control subjects were investigated. Effects of psychotherapy on hemodynamic responses were analyzed implementing two approaches: (1) an a priori region of interest approach and (2) a voxelwise whole brain analysis. Both analyses revealed increased hemodynamic responses in the left and right parahippocampal gyrus (and other regions) after multimodal psychotherapy in the contrast ""empathy with anger""-""control."" Our results are in line with psychoanalytical concepts about somatoform disorder. They suggest the parahippocampal gyrus is crucially involved in the neurobiological mechanisms which underly the emotional deficits of somatoform disorder patients. ",
pmid_15382253,"""I have often walked down this street before"": fMRI studies on the hippocampus and other structures during mental navigation of an old environment.",,"The role of the hippocampus in recent spatial memory has been well documented in patients with damage to this structure, but there is now evidence that the hippocampus may not be needed for the storage and recovery of a spatial layout that was experienced long before injury. Such preservation may rely, instead, on a network of dissociable, extra-hippocampal regions implicated in topographical orientation. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated this hypothesis in healthy individuals with extensive experience navigating in a large-scale urban environment (downtown Toronto). Participants were scanned as they performed mental navigation tasks that emphasized different types of spatial representations. Tasks included proximity judgments, distance judgments, landmark sequencing, and blocked-route problem-solving. The following regions were engaged to varying degrees depending on the processing demands of each task: retrosplenial cortex, believed to be involved in assigning directional significance to locales within a relatively allocentric framework; medial and posterior parietal cortex, concerned with processing space within egocentric coordinates during imagined movement; and regions of prefrontal cortex, present in tasks heavily dependent on working memory. In a second, event-related experiment, a distinct area of inferotemporal cortex was revealed during identification of familiar landmarks relative to unknown buildings in addition to activation of many of those regions identified in the navigation tasks. This result suggests that familiar landmarks are strongly integrated with the spatial context in which they were experienced. Importantly, right medial temporal lobe activity was observed, its magnitude equivalent across all tasks, though the core of the activated region was in the parahippocampal gyrus, barely touching the hippocampus proper.

To identify how neurovascular coupling changes during the pathophysiology of PD, patients and healthy controls underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging to measure neural activity organization of segregation and integration using amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and functional connectivity strength (FCS), and measure vascular responses using cerebral blood flow (CBF). Neurovascular coupling was calculated as the global CBF-ALFF and CBF-FCS coupling and the regional CBF/ALFF and CBF/FCS ratio. Correlations and dynamic causal modeling was then used to evaluate relationships with disease-alterations to clinical variables and information flow. Neurovascular coupling was impaired in PD with decreased global CBF-ALFF and CBF-FCS coupling, as well as decreased CBF/ALFF in the parieto-occipital cortex (dorsal visual stream) and CBF/FCS in the temporo-occipital cortex (ventral visual stream); these decouplings were associated with motor and non-motor impairments. The distinctive patterns of neurovascular coupling alterations within the dorsal and ventral visual streams of the visual system could potentially provide additional understanding into the pathophysiological mechanisms of PD.

Structural imaging studies in children have documented both cortical and subcortical changes in the brain. However, there have been only a few studies in adults and the results are inconclusive. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was applied to 44 adults with ADHD, Combined subtype, aged 18-54 years and 44 healthy controls matched for age, sex and IQ. ADHD patients showed reduced gray matter (GM) volume in the right supplementary motor area (SMA). Using more lenient thresholds we also observed reductions in the subgenual anterior cingulate (ACC) and right dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC) cortices and increases in the basal ganglia, specifically in the left caudate nucleus and putamen. There was a positive correlation between the cumulative stimulant dose and volume in the right SMA and DLPFC clusters. The findings suggest that adults with ADHD show brain structural changes in regions belonging to the so-called cool executive function network. Long-term stimulant medication may act to normalize these GM alterations. ",

Here, we identify intraflagellar transport 20 (IFT20) as a new target of this signaling in tumors that lack primary cilia, and find that IFT20 mediates the ability of Ror2 signaling to induce the invasiveness of these tumors. We also find that IFT20 regulates the nucleation of Golgi-derived microtubules by affecting the GM130-AKAP450 complex, which promotes Golgi ribbon formation in achieving polarized secretion for cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, IFT20 promotes the efficiency of transport through the Golgi complex. These findings shed new insights into how Ror2 signaling promotes tumor invasiveness, and also advance the understanding of how Golgi structure and transport can be regulated. ",
pmid_16256956,Association between amygdala hyperactivity to harsh faces and severity of social anxiety in generalized social phobia.,,"Previous functional brain imaging studies of social anxiety have implicated amygdala hyperactivity in response to social threat, though its relationship to quantitative measures of clinical symptomatology remains unknown. The primary aim of this study was to examine the association between response to emotionally harsh faces in the amygdala, a region implicated in social and threat-related processing, and severity of social anxiety symptoms in patients with generalized social phobia (GSP). Ten subjects with GSP naive to psychotropic medications and without psychiatric comorbidity and ten healthy comparison subjects matched on age, gender, ethnicity, and education completed the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale and underwent high-field (4Tesla) functional magnetic resonance imaging while viewing blocks of emotionally salient faces. Relative to happy faces, activation of the amygdala in response to harsh (angry, disgusted, fearful) faces was greater in GSP patients than in controls, and the extent of amygdala activation was positively correlated with severity of social anxiety symptoms, but not general state or trait anxiety levels. Our findings suggest that amygdala activation to interpersonal threat can be specifically linked to the severity of social anxiety symptoms of individual GSP patients, and thus, may serve as a useful functional marker of disease severity.

pmid_19863259,Dyslexic children show short-term memory deficits in phonological storage and serial rehearsal: an fMRI study.,,"Dyslexia is primarily associated with a phonological processing deficit. However, the clinical manifestation also includes a reduced verbal working memory (WM) span. It is unclear whether this WM impairment is caused by the phonological deficit or a distinct WM deficit. The main aim of this study was to investigate neuronal activation related to phonological storage and rehearsal of serial order in WM in a sample of 13-year-old dyslexic children compared with age-matched nondyslexic children. A sequential verbal WM task with two tasks was used. In the Letter Probe task, the probe consisted of a single letter and the judgment was for the presence or absence of that letter in the prior sequence of six letters. In the Sequence Probe (SP) task, the probe consisted of all six letters and the judgment was for a match of their serial order with the temporal order in the prior sequence. Group analyses as well as single-subject analysis were performed with the statistical parametric mapping software SPM2. In the Letter Probe task, the dyslexic readers showed reduced activation in the left precentral gyrus (BA6) compared to control group. In the Sequence Probe task, the dyslexic readers showed reduced activation in the prefrontal cortex and the superior parietal cortex (BA7) compared to the control subjects. Our findings suggest that a verbal WM impairment in dyslexia involves an extended neural network including the prefrontal cortex and the superior parietal cortex. Reduced activation in the left BA6 in both the Letter Probe and Sequence Probe tasks may be caused by a deficit in phonological processing. However, reduced bilateral activation in the BA7 in the Sequence Probe task only could indicate a distinct working memory deficit in dyslexia associated with temporal order processing. ",
pmid_18718456,Dysfunction of the attentional brain network in children with Developmental Coordination Disorder: a fMRI study.,,"Children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) present impaired motor skills, frequently associated with impaired attentional and executive functions. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of DCD on effective connectivity applied to a putative model of inhibition. fMRI was performed in 9 children with DCD and 10 control children (8-13 years old) performing a go-nogo task. As previously reported, children with DCD obtained a similar score for correct inhibitions as controls, but responses were slower and more variable than in controls. Compared to controls, Structural Equation Modeling indicated that: (1) path coefficients from both middle frontal cortex (MFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to inferior parietal cortex (IPC) increased in children with DCD particularly in the left hemisphere; (2) path coefficients between striatum and parietal cortex decreased in children with DCD in the right hemisphere. Results suggest that DCD could be characterized by abnormal brain hemispheric specialization during development. Furthermore, connectivity in the MFC-ACC-IPC network could indicate that children with DCD are less able than healthy children to easily and/or promptly switch between go and nogo motor responses. However, children with DCD seem to compensate for this poor efficiency by more actively engaging the ACC to prevent commissions allowing maintenance of a good level of inhibition. ",

The authors compared the neural circuitry mediating this process in bipolar youths relative to bipolar adults and in healthy volunteers. Participants were pediatric (N=16) and adult (N=23) patients with bipolar disorder and healthy child (N=21) and adult (N=29) volunteers. Functional MRI (fMRI) data were acquired while participants performed the stop-signal task. During failed inhibition, an age group-by-diagnosis interaction manifested in the anterior cingulate cortex, with bipolar youths exhibiting hypoactivation relative to both healthy youths and bipolar adults, and bipolar adults exhibiting hyperactivation relative to healthy adults. During successful inhibition, a main effect of diagnosis emerged in the right nucleus accumbens and the left ventral prefrontal cortex, with bipolar patients in both age groups showing less activation than healthy subjects. Anterior cingulate cortex dysfunction during failed motor inhibition was observed in both bipolar youths and adults, although the nature of this dysfunction differed between the two groups. Adults and youths with bipolar disorder exhibited similar deficits in activation of the nucleus accumbens and the ventral prefrontal cortex during successful inhibition. Therefore, while subcortical and ventral prefrontal cortex hypoactivation was present in bipolar patients across the lifespan, anterior cingulate cortex dysfunction varied developmentally, with reduced activation in youths and increased activation in adults during failed inhibition. Longitudinal fMRI studies of the developmental trajectory of the neural circuitry mediating motor inhibition in bipolar disorder are warranted. ",
pmid_26247858,"Nociception, Pain, Negative Moods, and Behavior Selection.",,"Recent neuroimaging studies suggest that the brain adapts with pain, as well as imparts risk for developing chronic pain. Within this context, we revisit the concepts for nociception, acute and chronic pain, and negative moods relative to behavior selection. We redefine nociception as the mechanism protecting the organism from injury, while acute pain as failure of avoidant behavior, and a mesolimbic threshold process that gates the transformation of nociceptive activity to conscious pain. Adaptations in this threshold process are envisioned to be critical for development of chronic pain. We deconstruct chronic pain into four distinct phases, each with specific mechanisms, and outline current state of knowledge regarding these mechanisms: the limbic brain imparting risk, and the mesolimbic learning processes reorganizing the neocortex into a chronic pain state. Moreover, pain and negative moods are envisioned as a continuum of aversive behavioral learning, which enhance survival by protecting against threats. ",
pmid_24280949,Acupuncture treatment of chronic low back pain reverses an abnormal brain default mode network in correlation with clinical pain relief.,"Acupuncture
Pain Management","Acupuncture is gaining in popularity as a treatment for chronic low back pain (cLBP); however, its therapeutic mechanisms remain controversial, partly because of the absence of an objective way of measuring subjective pain. Resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) has demonstrated aberrant default mode network (DMN) connectivity in patients with chronic pain, and also shown that acupuncture increases DMN connectivity in pain-modulator and affective-emotional brain regions of healthy subjects. This study sought to explore how cLBP influences the DMN and whether, and how, the altered DMN connectivity is reversed after acupuncture for clinical pain. RsfMRI data from 20 patients with cLBP, before and after 4 weeks of treatment, and 10 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (without treatment) were analysed using independent components analyses to determine connectivity within the DMN, and combined with correlation analyses to compute covariance between changes in DMN connectivity and changes in clinical pain. Visual analogue scale data were assessed to rate clinical pain levels. Less connectivity within the DMN was found in patients with cLBP than in healthy controls, mainly in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus. After acupuncture, patients' connectivities were restored almost to the levels seen in healthy controls. Furthermore, reductions in clinical pain were correlated with increases in DMN connectivity. This result suggests that modulation of the DMN by acupuncture is related to its therapeutic effects on cLBP. Imaging of the DMN provides an objective method for assessment of the effects of acupuncture-induced analgesia. ",
pmid_22177602,"Evidence of a dissociation pattern in resting-state default mode network connectivity in first-episode, treatment-naive major depression patients.",,"Imaging studies have shown that major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with altered activity patterns of the default mode network (DMN). However, the neural correlates of the resting-state DMN and MDD-related pathopsychological characteristics, such as depressive rumination and overgeneral autobiographical memory (OGM) phenomena, still remain unclear. Using independent component analysis, we analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data obtained from 35 first-episode, treatment-naive young adults with MDD and from 35 matched healthy control subjects. Patients with MDD exhibited higher levels of rumination and OGM than did the control subjects. We observed increased functional connectivity in the anterior medial cortex regions (especially the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex) and decreased functional connectivity in the posterior medial cortex regions (especially the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus) in MDD patients compared with control subjects. In the depressed group, the increased functional connectivity in the anterior medial cortex correlated positively with rumination score, while the decreased functional connectivity in the posterior medial cortex correlated negatively with OGM score. We report dissociation between anterior and posterior functional connectivity in resting-state DMNs of first-episode, treatment-naive young adults with MDD. Increased functional connectivity in anterior medial regions of the resting-state DMN was associated with rumination, whereas decreased functional connectivity in posterior medial regions was associated with OGM. These results provide new evidence for the importance of the DMN in the pathophysiology of MDD and suggest that abnormal DMN activity may be an MDD trait. ",

Water","Amphetamine, likely via action on the brain's dopaminergic systems, induces anorectic eating behavior and blunts dopaminergic midbrain activation to rewards. Past work has hypothesized that this blunted reward responsivity is a result of increasing tonic over phasic DA activity. We sought to extend past findings to sweet taste during fMRI following single-blind administration of dextroamphetamine and placebo in 11 healthy women. We hypothesized that neural response in both limbic and cognitive sweet taste circuits would mirror past work with monetary rewards by effectively blunting sweet taste reward, and 'equalizing' it's rewarding taste with receipt of water. Behavioral results showed that amphetamine reduced self-reported hunger (supporting the existence of amphetamine anorexia) and increased self-report euphoria. In addition, region of Interest analysis revealed significant treatment by taste interactions in the middle insula and dorsal anterior cingulate confirming the 'equalizing' hypothesis in the cingulate, but unlike monetary reinforcers, the insula actually evinced enhanced separation between tastes on the amphetamine day. These results suggest a divergence from prior research using monetary reinforcers when extended to primary reinforcers, and may hint that altering dopaminergic signaling in the insula and anterior cingulate may be a target for pharmacological manipulation of appetite, and the treatment of obesity.

pmid_20571458,Abnormal regional homogeneity of drug-naïve obsessive-compulsive patients.,,"To explore the possible abnormal resting-state activity in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), the regional homogeneity (ReHo) of 22 pairs of patients and well-matched healthy controls was calculated. Compared with controls, the patients showed higher ReHo in the left anterior cingulate cortex, but lower ReHo in the left inferior temporal gyrus. These findings supported the abnormal resting-state brain activity in drug-naïve OCD patients. No significant correlations between ReHo value and four clinical characteristics were found, suggesting that abnormal ReHo might be trait-related in OCD. ",

Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC)","The inability to control or inhibit emotional distractors characterizes a range of psychiatric disorders. Despite the use of a variety of task paradigms to determine the mechanisms underlying the control of emotional interference, a precise characterization of the brain regions and networks that support emotional interference processing remains elusive. Here, we performed coordinate-based and functional connectivity meta-analyses to determine the brain networks underlying emotional interference. Paradigms addressing interference processing in the cognitive or emotional domain were included in the meta-analyses, particularly the Stroop, Flanker, and Simon tasks. Our results revealed a consistent involvement of the bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, left inferior frontal gyrus, and superior parietal lobule during emotional interference. Follow-up conjunction analyses identified correspondence in these regions between emotional and cognitive interference processing. Finally, the patterns of functional connectivity of these regions were examined using resting-state functional connectivity and meta-analytic connectivity modeling. These regions were strongly connected as a distributed system, primarily mapping onto fronto-parietal control, ventral attention, and dorsal attention networks. Together, the present findings indicate that a domain-general neural system is engaged across multiple types of interference processing and that regulating emotional and cognitive interference depends on interactions between large-scale distributed brain networks.
